Reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures will be posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "We have not fully reconciled our non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because material items that impact these measures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort.", "In the question-answer session part of today's call, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question to allow as many callers as possible to ask their questions.", "I thank you in advance to your cooperation and I now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer, Steve Milligan.", "Steve Milligan", "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal second quarter financials and wrap-up with our guidance for the fiscal third quarter.", "At our Investor Day on December, we took the opportunity to present our differentiated platform, strategy, and business model, and to describe the significant growth opportunities for our company. With a growing storage industry and evolving data driven requirements, we are uniquely positioned to help define and drive the storage architectures of the future. We are pleased with the increasingly strategic interactions we are having with customers validating our approach to value creation.", "We reported strong financial performance in the December quarter enabled by excellent operational execution by our team. The favorable trends across all of our end markets that began earlier in 2016 continued. This included healthy demand for capacity enterprise hard drivers, all NAND based products, and hard drives in client applications helped by stronger than expected PC demand.", "We reported revenue of $4.9 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 37%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.30 outperforming the revised guidance provided at our Investor Day.", "We continue to execute well on two key strategic priorities, the integration of HGST, SanDisk, and WD, and the ramp of our 3D NAND technology. The transition to 3D technology continues as planned with the ramp of our 64-layer architecture. We commenced retail shipments and OEM sampling of our 64-layer products in the December quarter. As we demonstrated at Investor Day, we are executing methodically and thoughtfully on our technology strategy and we fully expect our leadership in 2D NAND to extend into 3D NAND.", "In 2017 and beyond, you will see the deployment of our 64-layer 3D NAND across our product portfolio spanning removable embedded client SSD and enterprise SSD offerings.", "As we all know from recent disclosures by Toshiba and news reports, our flash joint venture partner is facing challenges. We have been in regular communication with them over the last several weeks. We are confident that their semiconductor memory business remains healthy and strategically viable. Under any circumstance we will act to protect Western Digital's interest and work to ensure that we maintain the leadership position of our joint venture.", "In closing, I want to express my gratitude to our Chief Technology Officer, Steve Campbell who is leaving the company after 20 years of distinguished service to Western Digital. I also want to welcome Martin Fink on board as our new CTO. Martin brings deep storage systems and memory driven computing expertise that will help us accelerate our ongoing transformation.", "I'm sure Martin is known to many of you from his years at HP where he most recently served as CTO and Director of HP Labs at HP Enterprise. I'm delighted to have him on the senior team at Western Digital.", "I will now turn the call over to Mike to provide business highlights in the December quarter.", "Mike Cordano", "Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. Our December quarter results reflect strong execution across our portfolio, amidst the favorable industry environment in both flash and hard disk drive markets. Demand remained robust throughout the quarter and we launched several new products further expanding the breadth of our offering. We made additional gains in the ongoing conversion of 3D NAND technology and the commercial ramp of our 64-layer technology is accelerating.", "We are building stronger and deeper partnerships with our customers as our platform is increasingly aligned with our customer strategic direction. Overall, we had a strong finish to calendar 2016 providing business momentum as we entered 2017.", "In client devices, our participation with OEM customers has meaningfully increased as a driving portfolio of hard drives and flash based solutions address the PC market that is healthier than expected. Our revenue from client devices increased sequentially primarily driven by client SSDs and embedded products, as revenue synergies from the SanDisk acquisition benefitted us further in a seasonally strong quarter. Increasing storage capacities in mobile phones and market preference for client SSDs are long-term tailwinds for this portion of our business.", "Switching to client solutions. We experienced robust holiday seasonal demand and achieved sequential revenue growth driven by key NAND based products. We are pleased to note that the combined revenue contribution from new products such as iXpand and dual USB drives also grew underscoring continued consumer enthusiasm for our retail branded solutions.", "We announced new retail prospects including the four terabyte My Passport, eight terabyte My Book hard drive for the PC and a new four terabyte hard drive for the MAC. Shipments of our 64-layer 3D NAND based retail products began in the December quarter and we expect an increasing use of this underlying technology in our portfolio in 2017 and beyond.", "In the data center category, demand for high capacity storage devices remain very strong. Year-over-year Petabyte growth for capacity optimized hard drive met our upwardly revised expectation which we had estimated at 40% growth. We are pleased with the mainstream adoption of our 10 Terabyte third generation Helium drive. We have revised our planning to anticipate Petabyte year-over-year demand growth for capacity optimized hard drives to continue at approximately the same 40% rate compared to our prior forecast of about 35%.", "At our Investor Day, we announced that 12 Terabyte capacity Helium drive as well as derivative SMR based 14 Terabyte drive marking the start of our fourth generation Helium product line. The traction we have achieved on our Helium drive offerings, which were launched four years ago, demonstrates two true cost of ownership value for our customers and we look forward to providing them with ongoing innovation around this platform.", "Notably the December quarter marked a cumulative shipment milestone of more than 12 million helium drives reflecting our leadership in this category.", "From an enterprise SSD standpoint, we experienced strong demand across our products at both hyperscale and OEM accounts driving sequential revenue growth. In the December quarter, we announced our latest NVMe PCIe enterprise class SSD with leading performance and a high capacity SaaS enterprise SSD contributing to a further expansion of our portfolio.", "In our data center solutions category, our disk and flash storage platform business achieved several new design wins at leading system OEM customers for their cloud scale storage system. We are achieving new customer wins and solid repeat business from existing customers in key verticals around the world. This nascent business continued to represent a strong growth opportunity for the company.", "Turning to Silicon operations. We are very pleased with the progress we are making commercializing our 3D NAND technology. As I indicated earlier, we have already began retail product shipments containing 64-layer of BiCS3 and we also expect to launch client SSDs and embedded mobile offerings with this technology throughout the year.", "Additionally, we are on track to begin sampling enterprise SSD products utilizing 64-layer of BiCS3 this calendar year. We expect our broad implementation of BiCS3 across our portfolio will result in Western Digital having the industry's richest mix of 64-layer 3D NAND based products in calendar 2017, underscoring our growing confidence in our ability to successfully commercialize this technology.", "In the March quarter, we expect to break ground for the construction of Fab6 along with our joint venture partner Toshiba. Fab6 will provide new cleanroom space to support continued conversion of our existing 2D NAND capacity to 3D NAND. We expect operations in Fab6 to commence in calendar 2018.", "In closing, our December quarter results reflect the positive impact of the Western Digital platform; deepening customer relationships helped by our portfolio and technology expertise, along with our global go-to-market capabilities further strengthen us as a leading storage solutions provider.", "I will now turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussion.", "Mark Long", "Thank you, Mike. I'm pleased with our financial performance this quarter. Our team executed well in a healthy market environment as we capitalize on our strong product offerings, achieve targeted costs, and efficiency improvements, and improved our liquidity position with continued strong cash flow performance. We exceeded the revised guidance from our Investor Day on December 6 across our key financial metrics.", "Our revenue for the December quarter was $4.9 billion driven by strong performance in each of our end markets. Revenue in data center devices and solutions was $1.4 billion. Client devices was $2.4 billion and client solutions was $1.1 billion. In each end market, our revenue was flat to up from the September quarter, which underscores our strong performance as the September quarter is typically our strongest period.", "Our data center revenue growth continues to be fueled largely by cloud related storage demand. As a result, this quarter we saw continued strength in capacity enterprise hard drives, sequential growth for performance enterprise hard drives, as well as increased demand for enterprise SSDs.", "Client devices which include both hard drives and flash based products benefited from a healthier PC market as well as traditional seasonal trends. Embedded solutions experienced strong growth primarily from increases in storage capacity in mobile phones.", "In client solutions, our revenue grew as a result of strong demand for removable and other flash based products during the holiday season.", "Our non-GAAP gross margin grew to 36.7%, up 280 basis points versus the September quarter. We achieved this expansion through continued product cost improvements and healthy pricing for our products. Our product cost improvements resulted from consistent execution and ongoing progress with our integration activities.", "Turning to operating expenses, our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $797 million, down $66 million from the September quarter. We continue to make progress towards our integration synergy target, while making ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities, and IT projects as part of our transformation to enable future growth.", "Our non-GAAP interest and other expense for the quarter was $221 million. Our non-GAAP interest expense was $205 million, a reduction of $31 million from the September quarter driven by the debt repricings and reduction.", "Our non-GAAP other expenses net of interest income were $16 million for the December quarter. These expenses were primarily a result of foreign exchange revaluations that had no economic or cash impact. While it was an expense in the second quarter it will result in lower expenses in future periods. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the December quarter was approximately 13%.", "On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the December quarter was $675 million or $2.30 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $235 million or $0.80 per share.", "The GAAP income for the period includes intangible amortization and charges associated with our acquisitions and stock-based compensation. Therefore the net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is primarily a result of non-cash charges.", "In the December quarter, we generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations with $189 million spent on capital investments resulting in free cash flow of $871 million. We also had strong working capital performance contributing to our significant operating cash flows in the quarter.", "We paid the previously declared cash dividend totaling $142 million during the quarter and also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share.", "We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $5.2 billion. We have approximately $6.2 billion of liquidity available to us including our $1 billion in undrawn revolver capacity. Our net debt position has decreased approximately $800 million from the September quarter driven by higher cash balances.", "We remain committed to our long-term deleveraging plans, while also evaluating strategic investment opportunities as they arise. As Steve indicated, we have continued to make very good progress with respect to our integration. We remain on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017. As of the end of our fiscal second quarter this year, we achieved approximately $175 million of cost of revenue synergies and approximately $300 million of operating expense synergies each on an annualized basis.", "With respect to the SanDisk integration, as of the end of our fiscal second quarter, we have realized synergies of approximately $135 million on an annual run rate basis, toward our 18-month target of achieving $500 million of total run rate synergies on an annualized basis.", "To build on what Steve said about our flash joint ventures, it is important to note that the operations and financial position of flash ventures are healthy and investments are on track for the significant ramp of our 64-layer BiCS3 technology throughout calendar 2017. As a reminder, the joint ventures generate positive cash flow that is used to finance a significant portion of the capital requirements for both partners.", "I will now provide our guidance for the March quarter on a non-GAAP basis. As I have previously indicated, we generate slightly more revenue in the second half of the calendar year than in the first half. In that context, we expect revenue for our March quarter to be approximately $4.55 billion which represents significant year-over-year growth on a pro forma basis. As a result for fiscal 2017, we currently expect to generate pro forma revenue growth that is consistent with our long-term financial model. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to increase to approximately 38% primarily driven by continued favorable pricing and product mix across our business.", "Turning to non-GAAP operating expenses, we expect those to total approximately $800 million consistent with our December quarter. We continue to make progress with reductions in our cost and at the same time support our integration and growth with certain incremental investments. Additionally, we expect OpEx to be essentially flat in the fourth fiscal quarter consistent with second and third quarter levels. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $205 million. We expect an effective non-GAAP tax rate in the 12% to 14% range.", "As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $2 and $2.10 with an estimated share count of 298 million diluted shares.", "I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's call. [Operator Instructions].", "We will be taking our first question for the day from the line of Aaron Rakers from Stifel. Your line is open.", "Aaron Rakers", "Yes thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. I guess one of the things that stands out is that the near line business or I should say the total enterprise business, your capacity shift was down about 8%, your units were down about 1%, I think Seagate was down 14% sequentially on capacity shift. But the data points that we have seen throughout the quarter seem to be fairly healthy even Niedek recording pretty healthy growth in the spindle motors and enterprise. So I'm curious is are you ceding share to Toshiba what the dynamics look like specifically in the enterprise market and whether or not you are kind of capacity constrained and that was a variable to consider?", "Mike Cordano", "First of all, I think the year-over-year growth; I talked about in my comments, Aaron. So we saw coming at kind of as expected in around 40%. The other thing I would say is some of this is timing of when this revenue shows up. So from our standpoint we are seeing consistent demand and continued and continued strength and demand there. So I don't think there is anything we would say was outside of our planning expectation. And let me just add to your comment on share, we don't believe we ceded any share in the period.", "Aaron Rakers", "And were you at all capacity constraint?", "Steve Milligan", "We are -- this is Steve, Aaron. We are tight on capacity as it relates to capacity enterprise. The amount that we ship was not meaningfully impacted in terms of capacity constraints. But when you talk about this last quarter by the way given there is a large component count, if we saw demand spike in any regard we would struggle to meet some of that demand. But right now we are comfortable with where we are at from an overall capacity perspective but it is we are running pretty hard in terms of our capacity enterprise both in one account as well as on hard drive capacity.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele from Needham. Your line is open.", "Rich Kugele", "Thank you. Good afternoon and congratulations as well. Couple of questions I guess first when it comes to the cloud service or rather landscape, your percentage of the business if we include NAND going into that segment, I mean obviously the high capacity enterprises, a big factor there but are you supplying a large amount of the SSD side as well and then I have a follow-up?", "Mike Cordano", "Well certainly hyperscale is generally a growing segment for us, Rich, and as you know that today is principally SATA based interface, so yes we see that as a growing market opportunity and participation for us.", "Rich Kugele", "Okay. And then Mark if you needed to access quite a bit of capital for investment in let's say to Toshiba business further, how much capacity do you have on the balance sheet for leverage and or ask maybe another way, what's the minimum amount of cash you need to run the business?", "Mark Long", "Well Rich let me just say this first with respect to running the business, we have more than adequate liquidity and we feel very good about both our cash balances and the location of our cash. So that's something we are in very good shape on.", "With respect to strategic opportunities and accessing additional cash, I would just say we don't comment on anything in particular. And with respect to accessing additional liquidity, we recognize there are variety of ways we can do it, we feel like we have good alternatives with respect to additional capital, if we find an opportunity that weren't accessing more capital.", "But at this point, we just feel very good about our liquidity, feel very good about the way the business is operating, and one of the things we should also highlight is all this is within the context of our long-term commitment to deleveraging. So we really feel like we are in a good position from a balance sheet standpoint.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna. Your line is open.", "Mehdi Hosseini", "Yes, thanks for taking my questions. I have two follow-ups. The mission critical seem to be pretty strong in December quarter and I want to bit understand what is driving that obviously with NAND and SSD prices going up that may have shifted demand to more hard disk drive and also traditional enterprises have it yet in budget flash. So if you could elaborate on those two drivers and my follow-up question has to do with the free cash flow margin that came in around 18%, how should we think about sustainability of that free cash flow margin into 2017? Thank you.", "Mike Cordano", "Yes, let me comment first on performance enterprise. I think it's largely the seasonality the year-end purchase cycle that drove it. So we don't see any change in sort of our long-range plans relative to SSD as a substitute for performance enterprise. So we see that as more sort of a temporary effect. I will comment generally speaking on constraints around NAND whether it would be this category or the client category, the sort of tight supply situation is creating our modest bleeding effect for hard drive demand.", "Mark Long", "With respect to our cash flow generation kind of two things, one at Investor Day, we talked about a long-term range between 37 and 42 days for our cash conversion cycle and we did come in below that range due to strong linearity and some other very good execution by our team. So we would expect that in the near-term we may be at the lower end of the range or slightly below it, but there -- over the long-term as we talked about at Investor Day as flash becomes a larger part of our revenue, we may operate closer to the middle or towards the high-end of that range but that's really a long-term statement.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Sherri Scribner", "Hi thank you gentlemen. Just looking at the gross margin this quarter at the high-end of your updated range and the guidance for the March quarter suggest you're going to be at the high-end of the range for your gross margin. So the question is how long are these sort of high gross margin rates sustainable, I know the NAND market is very tight, it seems like there is some decent demand for the higher capacity hard drives but how long should we expect you to stay in this high-end of your range and should we expect you to revert back to sort of the middle of the range at some point? Thanks.", "Steve Milligan", "Sherry, this is Steve. I would add a few comments. I mean as we talked about before and will reiterate on this call, we are dealing with a tight NAND situation. We expect that situation to persist from a supply perspective through the balance of 2017, calendar 2017. So that obviously has a positive impact on our gross margins.", "As well as Mike indicated, we are seeing good mix in terms of our products particularly in terms of capacity enterprise, that's helping us and I think it's also important to note that the margin model that we've talked about one is a long-term gross margin model. That doesn't mean to say that first off that we are not going to stop at 38%. I mean if we can improve our margins beyond that, we are going to do that. And there also maybe sometimes where we actually exceed that, but right now in terms of the current quarter that we now began, we expect to operate at the high-end for some of the factors that I just mentioned.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stanley Kovler from Citi. Your line is open.", "Stanley Kovler", "Thank you very much. I just wanted to ask about Exabyte growth within the quarter and the outlook between the NAND and the HDD business for the following quarter. If we stake out capacity optimizer if you strip out that segment, what was the trend between the NAND and the HDD side of the business as far as capacity goes as we think about that coming down a little bit sequentially. And then as we look at the March quarter, what kind of seasonality do you expect from a unit perspective on the NAND and HDD businesses as well and I've a follow-up. Thank you.", "Mark Long", "So in terms of the first part and breaking down the Exabyte growth between hard drives and flash, we don't provide that that breakdown.", "Steve Milligan", "So we would also refer you to the investor material that we had at the Investor Day in terms of Exabyte growth kind of in the revenue growth and that's where I think there is a lot of good detail in terms of that side. If you want to call it segment of the business or market and generally speaking if you look at this last quarter both our growth, revenue growth, Exabyte growth, was generally in line with our previous expectations except for two things, capacity enterprise continues to push up to that 40% Exabyte growth that Mike talked about. And then also we saw a bit better of a PC market which helped us both in terms of our client SSD business as well as our hard drive business. And so really other than kind of a general rising of tides across the board, those were the only two segments that may be were a little bit better than what we expected. And if you can you repeat your second question, I don't remember that, well sorry.", "Stanley Kovler", "No, no problem. The second part of the question was as we think about Q1, I wanted to ask about the unit seasonality that we should think about for the NAND business and the HDD business because seems like if you are expecting better seasonality at least from enterprise perspective and PC perspective but units on the NAND side typically strong in Q1. So just trying to understand what the seasonality might have looked like between the two sides of the business there?", "Steve Milligan", "Yes, I think that let me talk. I'll give kind of an indication in terms of total units just from HDD perspective. The TAM came in this past quarter in terms of calendar Q4 at call it 112 million unit range. We would say that it probably would dropped to let's just call it 100 million unit range and pretty much all of that decline is largely due to the PC area. I mean in terms of from a unit perspective. And NAND we would expect to be seasonally down understanding that there hasn't tight supply. So you're going to see a little bit better demand than what you normally would see just from a sequential perspective as well as the fact as pricing continues to remain healthy. So that will help from an overall revenue perspective. So that's just some general guidance for you to kind of work from.", "Stanley Kovler", "Thanks. And if I could just follow-up, I wanted to ask about the consumer electronics and branded segment of HDDs, can you help us understand what the trends there it's a bit worsen seasonal, any product portfolio shift going on there, should we think about new products coming online in that area as we get throughout the year. Thanks a lot.", "Mike Cordano", "Yes, actually we really were operating within our expected range. I think we saw a little more strength on the flash side of the business driven by the same factors we talked about, but nothing unexpected there relative to either the HDD base or flash base part of that business.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Amit Daryanani", "Perfect, thanks. Congrats on the great quarter guys. I guess to start off with could you just may be talk about how much gross margin expansion do you still have from the cost takeout from HGST and SanDisk. I think it's a couple of hundred basis points that still lies ahead of you but could you guys help us quantify those two buckets. And if that's still ahead of you then could we operate in the 38% or 40% plus scenario provided the current supply demand dynamics sustain?", "Steve Milligan", "Yes that's a really good question. I have Mark kind of address the specifics but yes I fail to mention that when Sherry asked her question but yet we still have meaningful synergies. So we had particularly on the WD and HGST side. We also have some revenue synergies and then vertical integration synergies on the SanDisk side, but you are absolutely right. As those begin to kick in further that will certainly help us to maintain or improve our existing margin levels. So Mark is --", "Mark Long", "Let me just build on what Steve was saying. So as far as the COGS side from the HGST integration, we have achieved approximately half of the $350 million in run rate synergies that we expect to finish by the end of calendar 2017. So closing up this quarter we had approximately $175 million of cost of revenue synergies and another $175 million to get. So you're about right in that ballpark.", "Amit Daryanani", "Fair enough, that's very helpful and I guess may be just on the gross margin side, sequentially you guys are talking about revenues being down on 6%, 7%, 8% in the March quarter, gross margins are still reflecting higher, are they couple of things we would call out maybe it's mix or pricing that's helping but what's enabling such a big gross margin up tick when I would imagine as revenue deleverage?", "Mark Long", "Yes primarily mix and pricing and then we continue to make progress on our cost improvement operation.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital. Your line is open.", "Ananda Baruah", "Hey thanks guys and congrats on the progress and on the strength of the quarter. I guess two quick ones for me. The first is I would love to get your view Steve on the likelihood of hammer products being introduced over the next couple of years. And if you do think there is a possibility for that. What I guess what how should we think about sort of the impact on economics that you guys would see both on the hard drive side and potentially on the SSD side? Thank you.", "Steve Milligan", "Yes so we talked about it in the Investor Day that we expect that hammer technology will be productized sometime in the 2019 timeframe. There has been no change in our expectations as it relates to ourselves and others have talked about may be earlier than that. But in terms of our expectations, it's 2019.", "Now to be perfectly honest about that in terms of the question, the second part of your question, I mean there is two things that we have to do is that we have to demonstrate the capability of the technology so from an area of density standpoint as well as from a reliability and manufacturing perspective. And we also have to enable that technology so that it's competitive from a cost standpoint. Obviously given that we're not productizing until 2019, we haven't demonstrated that.", "And our view is that we would look to implement it until the economics or the products makes sense from a commercial perspective and so at this point, we would expect it largely to not impact our financials in any material way in terms of our financial model and that sort of thing.", "Ananda Baruah", "Got it. That is helpful and then just real quickly, you made prepared remarks about revenue synergy benefit, I guess I was just wondering ultimately how do you guys view what the revenue synergy potential is from adding SanDisk to the portfolio, it occurs to ask simplistically that sort of alters now that you have a whole portfolio just alters the way that you can engage out with the majority of your important customers. And so I guess why would -- why wouldn't there be just super significant potential there over time, whatever over timing when you get it to sort of normalize to really drive very material benefit from that dynamic. Thanks.", "Steve Milligan", "I think you articulated our strategy very well and the benefits that we're actually seeing today and we expect to see on into the future as a result of our broad product portfolio and the way our teams are now able to engage differently with our customers. So we've seen great traction as Mike has talked about in terms of client SSDs as a great example but really this applies to the way, we manage the entire portfolio.", "So that's exactly how we see it and that's why we feel very good about our ability to achieve the near-term $500 million total synergy target that's the 18 months target after the deal. And then the longer-term I think it's $1.01 billion that we expected in 2020, so you're right on.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Katy Huberty", "Thank you. Your closest competitor yesterday reported really significant unit and profit contribution from the non-PC, non-enterprise business that that you called consumer electronics and branded. Are you're not seeing that market do you share the view that new applications like surveillance and NAND will drive growth there and you just late to the party or what do you think the differential is because their business grew 20% sequentially, your business declined 20%?", "Mike Cordano", "Katy, let me comment on that, we are all like jumping at the bid to respond to that. We actually led the market in surveillance and so what's happening is that our largest competitor is now catching up to the party.", "Steve Milligan", "Right. So the other part goes to the way we classify this. So when we talk about our client solutions that is our retail branded business both flash and HDD base where things like surveillance show up is in our compliant devices business. So I think you'd expect similar trends that we saw relative to the strength of that business in our portfolio.", "Katy Huberty", "And can you talk about why over the last year surveillance has become aware of that of a driver of demand and how long do you think that plays out?", "Mike Cordano", "Well, that's I mean that's kind of I don't want to say difficult, I think that\u2019s going to continue I mean obviously given in the world that we live in and I'm look at the geopolitical kind of thing I mean surveillance is a meaningfully growing part of the market and these are drives that are obviously optimized or those kind of used cases. And I think it's important to note that there will drives but before for surveillance applications may be in a smaller scale, they just want to optimize for those application. And so it does not necessarily mean that it is incremental growth in the overall HDD market it's just a matter of where they're been utilized.", "Steve Milligan", "Right and I think the positive trend that comes with that market sort of an HDD side is the capacity requirements we get a preferable mix we all benefit from that. The other thing you should think about is that surveillance market is not just the HDD base. So when you think about the broader ecosystem around surveillance depending on the system that close a bit certainly there is an HDD component of it but there is a very strong forward-looking demand that requires flash-based storage when you think about the cameras themselves things that sit on the edge.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Sierra from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.", "Rob Sierra", "Hi, thanks very much and just kind of couple many comp mentioned at this stage one on your 3D NAND migration can you just is there any updates are or are you still looking at the same targets which I believe were the crossover on a bid basis in calendar 2017, is there any sense as you start working through when it that you exiting still calendar 2017 and same thing on a cost crossover 64-layer versus 2D. And then I guess finally you mentioned Fab6 I think your initial target for the crossover from a waiver standpoint 2018 is that reliant on Fab6. Thanks very much.", "Steve Milligan", "Yes, so few comments so, Rob yes I mean just a target about what we've to reaffirm what we've talked about in the past is that we expect that the cost crossover 0.4 of that's free technology that 64-layer 3D NAND will crossover against our 1G technology in the first half of calendar 2017 that remains the case, no change in that expectation at this point.", "And then the other thing is that what we had said historically is that approximately 50% of our total bid output for calendar 2017 will be 3D based. And obviously the majority of that will be 64-layer because that's what were transitioning to in terms of the cost crossover point. And so no real change on in our expectations in that regard. And I believe on the last conference call we've talked about, I think it was 40% of wafer, wafers out by the end of the year and that expectation remains the same.", "Rob Sierra", "All right. And then if I could just as look quick follow-up the again kind of confirmation you guys resolved the licensing deal with Samsung in the quarter with straight so that started to help the December quarter again for your positive guide next quarter. Any I mean and if you could give us from how much profit or margin or anything I think wasn't a meaningful help in the December quarter. Thanks.", "Steve Milligan", "No, in the December quarter was not a significant driver it helps. But we had a lot of underlying strength that really drove the overall performance. So it was a nice addition.", "Mike Cordano", "Yes and Rob just to be literal we don't have an intention on disclosing the dollar amount of that arrangement with Samsung.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz from Barclays. Your line is open. ", "Mark Moskowitz", "Yes, thanks good afternoon. I apologize I don't talk for few moments so if it's been asked I apologize but I want to understand firstly is there any area within the business right now in terms of mix that you easily you're out earning or may be seen outsized gains because of the NAND flash tighten as broadly speaking for the hard disk drive business and if so where is that in the cloud, the enterprise or other and didn't?", "Steve Milligan", "Repeat that again Mark, we want to make sure I understand the question, repeat that.", "Mark Moskowitz", "Yes, the question is I'm trying to understand because of what\u2019s growing in the NAND market right now from a capacity constrain perspective has that allowed for any sort of displacement of this drives to slowdown or maybe you've seen resurgence if you will in your hard disk drive business with cloud or enterprise or other that may be is not sustainable or maybe it is not, that may be people recognize you can guys still lot of offer goodness in hard disk drive that as well that's my first question that makes sense.", "Steve Milligan", "Yes, sure Mike comment on that earlier. I'll let Mike.", "Mike Cordano", "So give you some specific I think the tightness is, is helping in the client space so, the fact that there is tightness of supply makes more opportunity in the near-term for HDD demand to satisfy the storage requirement of a PC. Potentially in a much more modest way in the performance enterprise space we talked about that relative to our sequential growth in performance enterprise but they don't. The more pronounced factor there was actually just that the yearend budget, seasonal demand for enterprise systems. ", "And on the, on the cloud side no real effect so, where we are shipping destroys as an industry that's a specific value proposition and that demand is real when ongoing so there is clear differentiation in the architecture as relative to where flash is utilized or where disk is utilize so, there is no sort of reverse displacement there.", "Mark Moskowitz", "Okay and then my second question is kind of an loading questions I'm going to asked in any way in terms of the cloud that the cloud buying patterns over the past few years have the time has been punctuated let them up and down or some pauses do you see this year ahead may be having less pause and actually just continue up cycle and if that is the case because of the combined model now of SanDisk and WD are you getting a more reception, get a reception from the cloud providers to do more are you getting more line to expand with those accounts and thereby can that actually continue to put upward pressure of one goodness on gross margin.", "Steve Milligan", "Let me answer it in the sequence the way you asked it. So I think relative to the buying behavior we've certainly always characterized this segment on a annualized basis for that reason. I think that was updated and increased our annual growth rate is an indication of our confidence now in going strength. We've talked previous conference calls around some of that reason that that's happening as their sort of fewer efficiency things happening in hyper scale whether they be operational or technological.", "We believe we continue to see more raw or base demand flowing through us for HD and micro. So we would expect that, that 40% growth for the current calendar year relative to the sort of the way we engage them I think we talked about this earlier we certainly benefit from the broad portfolio of products our ability to participate across both HDD and flash-based product offerings give us the unique position to work not only short-term relative to sort of business engagement. But also long-term as we think about long-range data center architectures in the future. So we have all the components we're uniquely positioned to have that conversation and we're already benefiting from that portfolio ultimately.", "Steve Milligan", "All right. So that's our last question, so I want to thank you for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at upcoming investor conferences.

Welcome to Western Digital's Fourth Quarter Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2013. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. Thank you. You may begin.", "Robert Blair", "Thank you. We will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions today concerning growth, the storage industry and our position and opportunities in the industry, industry demand for the September quarter, our production levels and capital expenditures, customer response to our product offerings and our financial performance, including our financial results, expectations for the September quarter.

So we will not be taking any questions about sTec's business or its financial performance today. [Operator Instructions] I also want to note the copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investor section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of this call. I will now turn the call over to Steve Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Western Digital.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, Wolfgang Nickl will provide additional commentary on our June quarter results and outlook for the September quarter. I am pleased with our performance in the June quarter. Our financial results were strong, including significant free cash flow generation, reflecting outstanding execution by our HGST and WD subsidiaries. Industry demand in the June quarter was in line with our expectations, and we expect volume in the September quarter to be up modestly. Our production levels will be adjusted to prevailing demand conditions. Our growing participation in the storage market continues to highlight our broad-based role in the important and secular trend of digital data growth. We anticipate that the demand for exabytes of storage will grow by at least 34% per year through 2020, with exabytes shipped rising from 600 in 2012 to 5,900 in 2020. With advancements in storage, processing power, software and big data analytics, storage requirements are increasing significantly.", "There are thousands of new applications that are emerging based on new capabilities. An excellent example is the capability of one website that is processing 200 billion flight reservations to advise it's users when to optimally buy airline tickets. It is clear from applications like these that storage and the utilization of vast amounts of data are enabling breakthrough innovations, providing tangible support to underpin these data growth forecasts. Our goal is to innovate and differentiate our solutions to help our customers create value in this dynamic environment. Customers continue to respond favorably to the breadth of storage solutions we are providing.", "The Western Digital platform is unique, powerful and market-driven, underpinned by increasingly collaborative customer relationships, leveraging our rich engineering heritage and resources. For our fiscal year ended June, approximately 50% of our revenue was derived from applications in markets that are powering the public and personal cloud. While we are encouraged by recent innovations in the PC space, with less than half of our revenue as we exited fiscal 2013, the storage industry is experiencing dramatic change and we are participating in the high-growth markets of the future, investing in innovation and strategic acquisitions.", "In the last year, we have led the industry with the introduction of several new advanced solutions including our 7-disk helium sealed drives for cloud storage, our low-profile 5- and 7-millimeter solid-state hybrid drives and hard drives for ultra portable devices and new hard drive and mass solutions for small and medium businesses. All of these products have been well received by our customers.", "At our Investor Day last September, we indicated that we had established a strong position in enterprise solid-state storage with our family of SaaS-based SSD solutions. We also indicated that we were evaluating an expansion into other areas of this market. We concluded that solid-state storage will play an increasingly strategic role through continued innovation and differentiation. As a result, we recently made several important investments to strengthen and expand our enterprise SSD capabilities, including our proposed acquisition of sTec, an early pioneer in enterprise-class SSDs, the acquisition of VeloBit, a provider of high-performance storage I/O optimization software, and our investment in Skyera, a provider of very high-performance storage arrays. The sTec and VeloBit acquisitions will augment our existing technology position and IP portfolio in one of the industry's fastest growing markets.", "In summary, we are pleased with our performance and position in today's changing storage industry, and we are continuing to take steps that will enhance our ability to become one of the world's leading technology companies. I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Thank you, Steve. We are pleased with our June quarter performance as it demonstrates the resilience and strength of our business model, our sustained strong execution and the continued change of our business mix. The HDD industry shipped approximately 133 million units during the June quarter, slightly down from the March quarter and in line with our expectations in late April. In our business, we saw strength in enterprise. Stable quarter-over-quarter performance inclined in consumer electronics and anticipated seasonal softness in branded products.", "On a year-over-year basis, our business mix reflects our strong participation in growing cloud-related markets, with capacity enterprise and branded products up significantly. Our distribution and retail channel inventory remains lean, and our analysis suggests that inventory levels at our OEM customers remain at reasonable levels. Revenue for fiscal year 2013 was $15.4 billion. Broad-based participation in the secular growth of digital data is resulting in a more diversified mix of our revenue. Over the last 5 years, our non-PC-related business has grown from 35% to 50% of our revenue. Among PC-related businesses, includes our enterprise, branded and consumer electronic businesses. Our revenue for the June quarter was $3.7 billion. We shipped a total of 59.9 million hard drives at an average selling price of $60. We exceeded our revenue guidance due primarily to better-than-expected business mix and lower-than-expected like-for-like price declines.", "Our gross margin for the quarter was 28.2%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 29.1%, excluding $35 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin was approximately 60 basis points better than our guidance, reflecting better-than-expected business mix and capacity utilization and lower-than-anticipated price declines.", "R&D and SG&A spending totaled $582 million for the June quarter. SG&A included $18 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST intangible assets and other unrelated charges. We incurred charges of $8 million in the June quarter, reflecting continued alignment of our operations with anticipated market demand. Tax expense for the June quarter was $35 million or 7.8% of pretax income. Our net income for the June quarter totaled $416 million or $1.71 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $477 million or $1.96 per share. For fiscal year 2013, our net income totaled $1.7 billion or $6.75 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $2.1 billion or $8.53 per share.", "Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $684 million in cash from operations during the June quarter, and our free cash flow totaled $548 million. For fiscal year 2013, we generated $3.1 billion in cash from operations and our free cash flow totaled $2.2 billion. CapEx for the June quarter totaled $136 million. For the full fiscal year, we invested $952 million or 6.2% of revenue, including approximately $191 million for expenditures related to the floods in Thailand. Excluding the flood-related spending, we would have been at 5% of revenue, reflecting our measured approach to capital spending in the current demand environment.", "As part of our capital allocation strategy, first outlined last September at our Investor Day, we repurchased 4.4 million shares for $235 million during the June quarter. For fiscal year 2013, in total, we repurchased 19 million shares for $842 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.25 per share or a total of $59 million during the June quarter. In total, we declared a dividend of $1 per share or a total of $240 million during fiscal year 2013. We exited Q4 with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.3 billion, of which $1.5 billion was in the U.S.", "As disclosed in our press release, our financial information for the June quarter does not include any additional accruals as a result of the decision of the Minnesota Court of Appeals. We're in the process of reviewing the decision to determine whether or not to record an accrual for the June quarter.", "I will now provide our guidance for the September quarter, which does not include the estimated impact of the proposed sTec acquisition. For the September quarter, we are cautiously optimistic about a modest increase in the TAM, and we anticipate sustained strong performance within our business model. We expect a total available market of 135 million to 140 million units, up from the June quarter, primarily due to a seasonal uptick in gaming and branded products. Revenue in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion, reflecting modest price declines and a seasonal change in business mix. Gross margin well within our business model, and approximately flat with the prior quarter, excluding the amortization of HGST intangibles. R&D and SG&A spending of approximately $550 million, excluding the amortization of HGST intangibles. Tax rate within our 7% to 10% model, and a share count of approximately 242 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.95 and $2.05 for the September quarter. In summary, we're pleased with our continued strong performance and we're excited about our opportunity to play an increasingly strategic role in the evolving -- of the storage market. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel.", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "On the quarter, when you look at your operating expense line, it was a little bit higher than what we had expected in the June quarter. Can you talk about where we stand, as far as operating expenses, let's say, beyond the current quarter? And how we should maybe think about the progression of that operating expense relative to your long-term target model of 10% to 12%? And I do have a follow-up.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, Aaron. If you look to our investors summary, total operating expenses worth $590 million. That included $8 million of other charges. There were $10 million or $11 million of amortization of intangibles in there, and there was another $7 million of restructuring charges. If you deduct all of that, you're at $565 million, which compares to our guidance of $550 million, and the entire difference was due to incentive accruals that we took based on the performance of the teams. So we pretty much came out exactly like we anticipated and the real operational difference are intended for growth. As it relates to the go-forward spending, we've been very successful to keep it around that $550 million, and we'll be prudent going forward. We have said in the FAQ document that we issued alongside with the announcement of the sTec acquisition that, that will increase the OpEx for the time being. So we continue to be prudent and -- but we'll not forgo investment opportunities. And then of course, we will have to work longer-term on amortization, which will then give us a catalyst of to get into our 10% to 12% business model.", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And then as a follow-up, thinking about the business model and, obviously, thinking about you capital allocation strategy, you've seen a fairly consistent trend on the cash flow generation over the past several quarters, given what you've laid out for the September quarter, is there any change in the trajectory or that trend as we look out over the next couple of quarters in terms of free cash flow generation?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, I mean, we're very pleased with our free cash flow, $2.2 billion and each quarter above $525 million. That is a sign of a pretty stable, well-managed business. We intend to keep it that way. We stand to our capital allocation strategy, 50% of free cash flow, like we announced last year in September at the Investor Day, and we have no change as to that, today.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Just 2 questions for me. First, on the SSD front, I know you don't want get too much into comments on sTec, but the -- is there any sense you have that you could give us now on whether or not, post-deal, that there'd be enough revenue where you could actually break SSDs out as a category? Right now, it's basically a plug, but is there any way you could comment on that? Then I have a follow-up.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Rich, that's an interesting question. This is Steve. I mean, obviously, we'd like to think that the revenue gets big enough that we can break it out. I think we'll have to wait and see how it works out. We've been encouraged, in that we are limited, because we're still going through the regulatory review process and we're 2 separate companies, but we've been encouraged by the customer reaction that we've gotten regarding our proposed acquisition and we're comfortable that we think we're going -- that, that's going to be a sound investment for us and we're looking forward to working through the regulatory approval process in closing that transaction. So I hope that I can tell you after we get through a bit that we're big enough to be able to disclose and separate that out.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just lastly, in terms of that appeals court commentary, is -- should this actually go against you, would you be able to use your full cash balance, including the offshore, or would you need to use the domestic dollars?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "We would use offshore cash.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research.", "Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC", "Just 2 questions on 2 different end markets. Just -- from looking at your branded sales and looking at Seagate's, I know you mentioned seasonality in that market, but I was curious if there's any kind of weakness in demand relative to the market, or maybe you're gaining some market share there. It seems like both companies, it's my observation, were relatively weak in that market. And if not, maybe you could just talk about how you think it's going to proceed for the rest for the calendar year? And then, secondly, on the flip side, could you talk about maybe the enterprise market? It's obviously been very strong because of some web scale spending. Do you think there's a pause coming in that or how do you sort of gain the demand trends there?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "I'll start you off, Steven, and then Steve will probably comment on top of that. Branded, really no surprise, it's seasonally a soft quarter, particularly Europe is always very soft at this time of the year. Very pleased with the mix. You're seeing sell-in data that we're reporting. We're very pleased with the inventory levels in the market there. I'm very confident that, that market is seasonally picking up in the next 2 quarters. So really nothing that we wouldn't have expected there. Ongoing move there to NAS Boxes away from direct attached, but really nothing extraordinary to report on. The enterprise market last quarter was a little bit stronger than we expected and particularly on the capacity enterprise space. And that's really playing out as we predicted it as well. Performance enterprise is stable, but not up. Capacity enterprise, up. And like we said before, that segment of the market that we think for the next 5, 6, 7 years, has the strongest growth. And we said before that we wouldn't be surprised if that would be double digit.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Nehal Choksi with Technology Insight Research.", "Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC", "So client performance was -- client hard drive performance was flat Q-to-Q, which is consistent with the third-party market research organizations. But in the March Q, the hard drive and Western Digital client performance outperformed. I was wondering if you could talk about that in the context of hybrid and dual drive uptake by OEMs. And to follow-on with that, can you talk about what your expectations are with whether or not hybrid drives will be GM accretive, and if it's not GM accretive, will be at least gross profit accretive per unit?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "So in terms of our business, we, for the first half of the year, have not been impacted by -- we're not shipping a hybrid drive in terms of the first half of the year. It's really for us, more of a back half of calendar 2013, and in particular, 2014, as we see customers begin to adapt that sort of a solution. And now, customers are, as you referenced, dual-drive configurations are meaningful. And we're kind of agnostic, frankly, whether it's a dual-drive configuration or a hybrid configuration. And so, because both of them, ultimately, use a hard drive or spinning disks. Now in terms of the gross margin comment, I'm going to deflect that question in the sense that we don't typically talk about gross margin by product, whether or not it's accretive or non-accretive. And so I'm going to not answer that question.", "Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC", "Okay. Do you mind if I ask a separate question then?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Sure.", "Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC", "The cash conversion cycle, that was up an unseasonal 5 days quarter-over-quarter. And looks like it was primarily driven by an increase of DSOs. But you guys clearly said that channel inventory's not an issue. So can you give some clarification as far as what's really going in -- on here? And does this impact your visibility into September quarter relative to past September quarters?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Nehal, there's no change in payment behavior of our customers. We had really good linearity in the quarter, as you can see from our free cash flow. The uptick in DSO is purely a function of channel mix. If you look at the channel split, our OEM business went from 60% to 66%, and our Distribution business and Branded business went down. So no significant change. Seasonally, expect that -- and doesn't have any impact on visibility on the September quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "I guess, two, if I could. The first is just a general question around gross margin dynamics. Could you give us an update on, I guess, where you are with the single platter shift and what the impact -- at least [indiscernible to margins was this quarter? And then, can you first speak to why margins wouldn't go up in the second half of the year? Or is there a chance for that and you're just sort of being prudent with the guidance, given sort of more stable than expected like-for-like ASPs and what's going on with mix? And I have a follow-up.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "So as it relates to Q4, gross margin, we're very pleased to beat the guidance by 60 basis points. And that was really a function of several things, capacity utilization, but also of business mix, more enterprise business, and then lower like-for-like price declines. As we go into the September quarter, the flat margin is more or less a function of the business mix. We have plans for modest price declines and, as every quarter, we're trying to optimize the results as we go through the quarter.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "And just some clarification on the transition to single platter, and then I have a follow-up.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "We're making steady progress. Last quarter, I told you that we're around 50%, and that we would probably take another year or so to completely transition it. We'll do that when it economically makes sense, and we're making steady progress on that front.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Great. And I guess, the last thing for me is can you speak about, or is it too early to speak about it, could you give us some sense of what your expectations are for the game cycle? Refreshes are taking place in the second half of the year and, traditionally, that's been, I guess, a really strong market for you guys. So I guess, any detail you can give us around how we should be thinking about that in the context of industry potential and WD potential would be helpful.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "I'm sorry, what cycle? I didn't understand what you said.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "The -- sort of, I guess, the new Xbox and the new PlayStation.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Oh, yes, yes, yes. So those are 100% attach rates and part of the demand increase that we're -- or TAM increase, I guess, I should say, that we're expecting in calendar Q3 is reflective of that, the gaming build that will take place for the Christmas season. And so we're happy that it's going to be a 100% attach rate. And we will, as a company, we've been a relatively big participant on the gaming business. I mean, there's only 2 guys, right, Microsoft and Sony. And we will continue to participate in that business to the extent that it makes economic sense.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Thanks, Steven. I guess, that suggests sort of de facto share gain in the second half of the year, since you guys are the dominant player there?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "I wouldn't imply that. I mean, we've been a strong participant in that market, if we're going back for a while. And so I wouldn't imply that we think that there'll be share gains solely as a consequence of that, right? We have to see how everything plays out.", "Operator", "Our next question comes Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "The first one for me is, could you provide some comments on what you think the TAM does in December?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes. We assume, right now, in our modeling that's around 140 million units.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. So...", "Stephen D. Milligan", "One of the things that we're going to have to do, Keith, and this is -- it's going to be interesting to see. I mean, obviously, the news on the PC front has not been that rosy, right, in terms of what some of the other guys in the supply chain have talked about. And so now, what we're beginning to see is some building of product, sort of filling the pipe for back-to-school and for the holiday season, particularly, back-to-school, really, at this point. I mean, we're beginning to see increased sort of demand levels as a consequence of that. The key thing that we're going to have to see is, how does that product sell-through, right? Does that actually translate to either a flattening in terms of the declines that we've seen on the PC side or maybe a little bit of growth? And so what we're doing is taking a pretty cautious approach to that. And so -- but I certainly, it's kind of -- it's sort of a different question than what Rich asked about splitting out SSD, I'd certainly like to be able to report increasing or accelerating PC sales, but I don't think that we're at the point where we can say that yet. You have the sell-through happens.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Well, my second question actually relates to that, Steve. Over the last 4 quarters, and in particularly the last 2 quarters, your client units have done significantly better than your competition. And what's driving that? And would you give any comments on does that continue? And obviously against Seagate in particular?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "I don't know if I can comment on that both because, I mean, we have not had a specific strategy to increase our share in those markets, which is kind of interesting. And so, sometimes we look at the share numbers after the fact and -- because it's not a goal of ours to say, \"Hey, let's go and increase our market presence in that particular market.\" And so, I have a neat answer for you, other than, and it may sound a little bit self-serving, we are -- both WD and HGST have done a great job from an execution standpoint. And that's allowed us to increase our position in those marketplaces.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Any thoughts on whether that continues, Steve?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "I don't want to call that. Obviously, we want to make sure that our good execution continues. And if it happens to result in profitable gains from a market share perspective and the right kind of financial performance, we're happy to do that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe Wittine with Longbow Research.", "Joseph Wittine - Longbow Research LLC", "First up, I wanted to see if you could reconcile your projected growth in the TAM in the third quarter with your sales guidance. So the TAM, at the midpoint, you're up 3% or 4% sequentially. Your sales guidance at the midpoint is up 50, 60 bps, or something like that. So are you -- is that conservatism? Or are you perhaps going along with the last question, perhaps planning to concede a little bit of share after gaining quite a bit of it over the last few quarters?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Like Steve said, I mean, we're not really going into a quarter with particular share targets. We're trying to execute well and then put linearity in good products. But that's mostly a mix factor. In particular, the gaming business is a lower ASP business and that just plays into that equation.", "Joseph Wittine - Longbow Research LLC", "And then, you already said looking at -- talking about free cash flow for '14, you said you'd like to continue the stability, I guess. Any thoughts within that on capital expenditures? Do you still expect to be within the bottom of the range next year as you were this year?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, I mean, we will be in our business model from 5% to 7%, and we will heavily be focused on technology deployment and upgrades to new aerial densities and supply flexibility, et cetera. Then we just need to decide as we get into the second half of the fiscal year what the predictions are for the end of calendar '14, and that will determine where we end at the end of the day. But you should assume that we'll be extremely prudent and as just in time as possible with deployment of capital.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray.", "Daniel F. Garofalo - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "It's Dan Garofalo on for Andy. I just wanted to talk about, from a restructuring standpoint, you've continued to kind of rightsize manufacturing, and if we set aside anything related to a favorable MOFCOM ruling, where would you say you're at with the rightsizing process? Are we -- are you kind of halfway done doing what you can do? Or is there more than less than that? Or how would you characterize that, I guess?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes, I'll answer it this way. I mean, if you look at our financial performance, I mean, obviously, we want to do everything that we can to continue to improve our profitability. I think if you look at our gross margin performance, we're solidly within our gross margin range, which kind of implies that the actions that we've taken sort of seem to be appropriate from a rightsizing perspective. And that's, obviously, based upon, let's just use round numbers, say a TAM of kind of that 135-ish kind of range, 135 million a quarter. The thing that we have to watch closely and we're certainly not predicting it, but this is, do we have something further? If that were to change, and decrease, then we'd have to look at doing something else. But I think that we're comfortable where we're at, generally speaking, from a capacity perspective, given that kind of a TAM level.", "Daniel F. Garofalo - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Great. That's helpful. And then, just one follow-up for me. On the enterprise side, I think you've indicated that the 7-platter helium drive should be out sometime in the second half of the year. And I know you've touched on those in your prepared remarks, could you provide an update on timing there? And secondly, when the drives are available, is it fair to say, you expect some movement from market share perspective within the capacity optimized segment?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes. So we -- we're currently sampling these products with selected customers right now, or that product with selected customers. And we continue to expect that we will have units shipped and revenue realized before the end of the calendar year. The first generation product will not be a particularly significant volume product to start out with, as customers test it out and that sort of thing. So I would doubt whether or not that will meaningfully move the needle in terms of any market share in the capacity enterprise, at least initially. And then we'll have to see how the adoption goes from there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I just have a quick clarification. Can you give us some -- or can you give us the numbers for your nearline SATA enterprise versus the performance enterprise?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Sherri, we haven't broken that out.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Can you give us some ballpark or help us think about it in terms of magnitude?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "What we have said before is that our share in all the areas of the market that we serve is comparable. And the performance enterprise market is pretty stable, just shy of 8 million units compared to the last quarter.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then, just thinking about the recent acquisitions you've done with VeloBit or at least that you've announced in Skyera, just trying to understand the motivation for doing those acquisitions? I understand those to be primarily sort of SSD array type of companies, and you guys are an HD business, it doesn't seem like you'd be doing arrays yourselves, that would seem to be competing with your customers. But just wanted to understand where you're going with that technology?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes. So Sherri, just to clarify one thing. We did not acquire Skyera, we made an equity investment on Skyera back. And that -- and that's more of reflective of our interest to stay close to the technology changes and advancements that are going on in that space, as opposed to us getting into, per se, the storage or the SSD array kind of business. So that's one clarification. The VeloBit acquisition which, from a financial perspective, was not particularly significant, is really to provide software capability in terms of input/output optimization, caching kind of capability, that sort of thing, to improve our existing -- or any future offerings that we have in the enterprise SSD space. So it really is an effort to make our products more compelling than they otherwise would be.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Couple of questions. One, I guess, if I look at the finished goods inventory, it was up about $22 million, 5% sequentially in the quarter. Could you maybe talk about what were the drivers that led to that uptick?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "I'll take that question. Overall, our inventory was pretty stable for the last 3 quarters, and there's always a bit of a shift between the raw and FGI. But we have made a conscious decision to invest in FGI in 2 areas. Number one, we're making more use of boat shipments in areas where we understand the demand very well, and that contributes to our cost savings. And the second one is, we want to make sure that our just-in-time warehouses have sufficient inventory at quarter-end to make sure that there is a smooth operation guaranteed at our customers' level. Overall, we believe that we all the time have opportunity in the inventory space, but probably more in the raw and whip [ph] area that in the FGI area. So we're pretty pleased with the executions, very stable, but future opportunity is likely.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Fair enough. And I guess, if I just look at the September guide, you guys are suggesting gross margin should remain flat on a sequential basis. To me, at least it looks like the mix is going to end up being a bit of headwind with gaming's up, picking up on a sequential basis. Maybe just talk about what are the offsets to that mix being a bit of a drag in the September quarter?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, you're right that the mix is a bit of a headwind but then it's likely a little bit of a higher volume. That's a tailwind and then we'll continue to work on our costs and all the other elements. But you got it, the mix is the headwind and we're offsetting it with cost and good execution.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley.", "Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just going back to the compute market, notebooks, specifically, were up more than seasonal. Can you talk about what area of that market you think you're taking share?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Kate, I don't know if there's any specific area, per se. I think I commented on earlier in terms of -- it wasn't so much that we had a deliberate strategy to increase our market share in that particular segment, but both of our subs, just really, frankly, did a very nice job working with our customers in such a way that we were actually able to kind of keep our situations sort of flat when the market was down a little bit, and we were able to gain a little bit of share.", "Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then just as a follow-up, I understand visibility is probably pretty low, as you said, you're seeing build for back-to-school, but you got to see demand, are you seeing any signs in your business of a demand recovery in traditional PCs, or the traditional enterprise storage market?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Well, okay. That's kind of a two-pronged question. The traditional PCs, I mean, we -- our customers continue to be very cautious with regards to what they're seeing from a PC demand perspective, whether that be desktop or notebooks. And particularly, notebooks, right, is where the real cautiousness is. Desktop has tended to be a little bit more stable over time. When you start moving into the enterprise space, I mean, it depends upon who you're talking to and, obviously, we don't care to talk about specific customers, but with what we're seeing from a digital data growth perspective, demand in that space, overall, continues to increase. And that's reflective in the unit increases that we're seeing in terms of our enterprise business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rob Cihra with Evercore.", "Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "I'm not sure how much it's related to the last question in -- earlier on, nearline, but Steve, maybe when you combine your SSD moves, about the strength you've had in the SaaS side and then in your planned acquisitions, and you look at the traditional enterprise market, I mean, do you look out and feel like traditional enterprise is a growth market or a shrinking market getting squeezed between nearline, at the low end, and SSD, at the high end? Or do you feel like that's actually a positive growth market going forward?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes. So traditionally, you hit the nail on the head, the traditional enterprise business, we do not view as a growth business. It's fairly stable in terms of its demand, which is great, which is fine. But the growth areas in terms of enterprise are in the capacity enterprise market, and then also we believe in enterprise class solid-state drives.", "Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Right. And if I could ask a follow-up related to that, would you -- my guess is, no, but would you guys be willing to share what percentage of your enterprise revenue, even ballpark, is direct to kind of big web scale customers rather than through traditional OEM channel?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes. I appreciate the question but that's not one that we're going to address, Rob.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Miller with Noble Financial.", "Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "A few questions back. And I know you want to be cautious. But Nidec yesterday reported a 16% increase in their unit shipments of motors to hard drive manufacturers, and yet both you and Seagate, in terms of your TAM expectations, are certainly below that. Is this an inventory restocking thing or more cautious, or both?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "I don't know, Mark, honestly. I haven't gone and studied what Nidec disclosed. But it's -- it's obviously not -- it's got to be inventory-related. I mean, because it must be a replenishment thing, but that's speculation on my part.", "Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. You certainly made some big efforts recently in the solid-state drive market with your acquisition. But I was just wondering, 2 weeks ago, Micron kind of surprised people. A lot of people feel that they -- because of technology challenges that solid-state drive, NAND flash, can't be pushed much further beyond the 18-nanometer node. And a lot of firms are now looking at three-dimensional type flash. SANDisk, for instance, is talking about that in 2015. Yet Micron came out and said they, by perfecting a high-K metal gate process, were able now to -- are selectively sampling 16-nanometer flash and estimates are that they would have a factor 2 margin advantage if they can pull that off over competitors at a higher node, which if you look at it conversely, it could actually lower the price of, say, a 128-gig drive and keep margins same as some of your competitors' by $15 to $20. I'm just wondering any comments on that in terms of the impact on your solid-state or your hard drive business.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "I don't have any direct perspective on that, Mark. But I think that one of the things that we've got to keep in mind is that, I mean, flash or NAND is shipped into a lot of different applications. And those applications have different reliability or different characteristics. So I don't know if Micron is alluding to those being able ship into kind of client applications, which maybe have a different profile associated with them, it's one of the things that we've recognized and is part of the value add that we provide, as a hard drive company, is making sure that products that are provided meet the right criteria for enterprise kind of applications. So Micron, along with some of the other NAND guys that is accompanying that, we are working with and want to continue to work with, in terms of what it is to utilize their technology to the advancement of our customers.", "Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "So your relationship with Micron would not put you at a disadvantage if they start competing against other people shipping flash coming out of a higher node? Is that correct?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "I think that the opportunity in the marketplace is big and I don't -- I think that there's plenty of opportunity for all of us.", "Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "It was MLC flash which, I think, probably feels more for a lower end type storage application because of some of the issues with program arrays with MLC flash.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "I want to thank you again for joining us. In closing, I also want to thank all Western Digital employees for their dedication and outstanding performance, and our customers and suppliers for their support. We look forward to being in touch with you. Thank you.", "Operator", "That does conclude today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Jay Iyer, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining us on the call today are Sanjay Mehrotra, President and CEO of SanDisk; and Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President of Administration and CFO. ", "Before we begin, please note that any non-GAAP financial measures discussed during this call, as defined by the SEC in Reg G, will be reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Sanjay.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered yet another record quarterly revenue driven by year-over-year growth in both our OEM and retail channels. Excellent improvements in memory cost helped deliver a very healthy gross margin. Despite the uncertainties surrounding the global macroeconomic environment, overall demand for our products continued to grow. This illustrates the secular growth trends in consumer and enterprise markets, which are driving ever-increasing demand for flash storage solutions and also highlights the benefits of our broad product portfolio and our diversified and global customers and channels. ", "Our mobile revenue grew nicely on a year-over-year basis from the increased sales of our embedded products, including iNAND, for mobile devices. The mobile market continues to experience robust growth in feature phones, smartphones, tablets and eReaders, and OEMs are increasingly competing by differentiating on product feature and performance attributes. Our broad array of high-performance embedded mobile products, including iNAND, iNAND Ultra, iNAND Extreme, iSSD and removable cards position us well for continued success in this evolving market. As for the tablet market, it underwent a significant shake out in the third quarter and yet, we delivered 25% year-over-year revenue growth from our retail and OEM mobile end markets combined, reflecting our strong gains in this ecosystem. ", "Turning to the solid-state drive business. I'm very pleased to report that our integration of Pliant Technology has gone exceedingly well. We are excited to see robust business momentum from our enterprise storage solutions group. SanDisk enterprise SSDs have been qualified at 3 out of 7 Tier 1 storage OEMs with multiple systems now shipping, contributing to strong revenue increase in the third quarter. We are deeply engaged at other OEMs and we expect to complete qualifications at several more customers in the next few months. Our differentiated products feature a proprietary, massively parallel architecture, utilizing our third-generation ASIC controller and advanced firmware. All of these features are designed to deliver very fast, predictable, data transfer and processing speeds with minimal power consumption. We expect to continue building on our early success in this business especially as we begin using our high-quality captive memory supply in our leadership products, and we believe that vertical integration will be key to long-term success in this market. ", "Within the PC ecosystem, innovation is unfolding in Ultrabooks driving demand for NAND flash. Specifically, from a system design perspective, NAND Flash can be designed into Ultrabooks either as high-capacity solid-state drives or as lower-capacity caches alongside high-capacity hard drives. Ultrabooks designs mandate a highly responsive user experience with features such as instant-on and longer battery life, packaged in an ultrathin form factor. We believe these innovations -- we believe these innovative developments bode well for significantly increased NAND flash consumption in the PC ecosystem in the years ahead. We have begun making inroads into this market with our SSDs and we have an early footing with the recent launch of one of the first SSD-only ASUS UX21 and UX31 Ultrabooks with another Tier 1 OEM design win achieved already. Design activity projects at several other OEMs are underway. ", "Our retail channel grew year-over-year, a trend that has continued since the first quarter of 2010. The emerging markets were the primary source of year-over-year growth in the third quarter. On a sequential basis, all regions posted healthy revenue growth with APAC the strongest. Third quarter retail revenue growth benefited from a successful back-to-school season in the U.S. with strong demand for our USB flash drives and mobile cards. In September, we unveiled a broad lineup of new retail products, mostly -- most notably the 64GB SanDisk Extreme Pro SD card and SanDisk Mobile Ultra microSD card, reflecting continued innovations in our removable products category. We also introduced the SanDisk Memory Vault, a new product designed to preserve images in their original quality for up to 100 years, creating a new preservation solution category. From a fourth quarter perspective, we believe we are well-positioned with our key accounts with programs and promotions in place for the holiday season. ", "In manufacturing, our 24-nanometer technology continues to ramp and accounted for slightly more than 60% of our bit production in Q3. We are on track to ramp production of our 19-nanometer technology this quarter using both 2-bit-per-cell MLC as well as 3-bit-per-cell X3 memory, which we expect will sustain our cost leadership in 2012. Fab 5 ramp is going very well with yields at world-class levels, a significant achievement in the short time since the Fab 5 began production in July 2011. We expect to deliver approximately 75% captive supply bit growth this year. If you recall, we originally provided a mid-80% bit growth estimate early in 2011, and this latest forecast takes into account the impacts related to the earthquake, the subsequent supply chain disruption as well as the power outage earlier this year. ", "Switching to our outlook. The secular demand drivers for our business remain strong and we believe there will be a healthy industry demand -- healthy industry environment in 2012. We expect the current capacity expansion commitment within Phase I of Fab 5 to be completed by the end of January 2012 and future Phase I expansion to begin approximately 3 months later. With this capacity plan, we expect our 2012 captive bit growth rate to be somewhat higher than in 2011, and the key drivers of the 2012 bit growth will be the 19-nanometer technology transition and the wafer capacity expansion in Fab 5. We believe that this plan achieves the best balance between prudent expansion and leveraging the growth opportunities ahead of us. We also plan to continue using some portion of noncaptive supply in 2012 to maintain flexibility in our supply mix. ", "From a demand driver standpoint, the outlook remains very favorable. NAND flash is a key enabler of smart mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets and Ultrabooks and it is increasingly used in high-performance enterprise storage and server systems. The broad and growing application opportunities for NAND flash bode well for the long-term outlook of our business. ", "In summary, Q3 was yet another solid quarter for SanDisk. The growth engines for NAND flash remain vibrant, and through our technology and systems expertise, we are delivering an ever-broader array of innovative storage solutions to our customers. ", "I will now turn over the call to Judy for her financial review.", "Judy Bruner", "Thank you, Sanjay. We are pleased to report another quarter of record revenues and robust profitability. This quarter marks the ninth quarter in a row of operating margins above 25% on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. Year-over-year, our gigabytes sold grew 87% and our ASP per gigabyte declined 37%, contributing to a healthy 15% growth in revenues. Sequentially, our gigabytes sold increased 18% and our ASP per gigabyte declined 13%, yielding sequential revenue growth of 3%. Our sequential price decline was influenced by product mix, in particular a reduced mix of iNAND sales during the quarter due to the tablet market shakeout and an increased mix of OEM card sales. The timing of our sales during the quarter also contributed to the sequential price decline. We were relatively supply constrained during Q3 with our inventory balances benefiting late in the quarter from the Fab 5 ramp, allowing us to end Q3 with inventory better positioned, although still lean, for the fourth quarter. ", "The mix of our product revenue in the third quarter was 65% OEM and 35% retail. Q3 retail revenue grew 11% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. Our highest sequential retail growth was in Asia driven by increased penetration in China and India, and we were also very pleased with our sequential growth in North America retail, which was driven by strong back-to-school results. ", "Q3 OEM revenue was down 1% sequentially and up 21% year-over-year. Within our OEM business, we experienced rapid growth in enterprise SSD sales and some sequential contraction in the mobile sector influenced by our limited supply as well as realignment in the tablet market. On a year-over-year basis, the mobile segment of our OEM business grew at the same 21% rate as our overall OEM sales. Our license and royalty revenue was 7% of our total revenue in Q3, contributing 4 points to our overall gross margin. ", "We achieved the high end of our gross margin expectations with non-GAAP total gross margin of 44% and product gross margin of 40%. Our product gross margin declined one percentage point sequentially driven by the appreciation of the Japanese yen and increased noncaptive usage, which was 11% of memory supply in Q3. Fab 5 ramped very efficiently during Q3, resulting in startup costs below our forecast and actually down sequentially from Q2. On a year-over-year basis, the combined impact of the Japanese yen noncaptive usage and Fab 5 startup costs was approximately 8 points of gross margin. Our overall cost per gigabyte improved 11% sequentially. ", "Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses of $210 million were below our forecast due to a delay in the ramp of certain advanced technology expenses, lower-than-expected marketing and sales programs and a reduced rate of hiring, which we instituted during the quarter in light of macroeconomic uncertainty. On a sequential basis, our R&D expenses were down approximately $11 million as the elimination of Fab 5 startup costs from R&D was only partially offset by a full quarter of enterprise SSD expenses and increased advanced technology spending. ", "Our operating margins remained consistent sequentially at 29% on a non-GAAP basis and 27% on a GAAP basis. Non-GAAP other income and expense increased $10 million sequentially and included a $9.3 million gain on the repurchase of $222 million of our convertible debt. We were able to repurchase a portion of the debt maturing in May 2013 at slightly more than 95% of par, which made economic sense given the low rate of interest on cash and the 1% coupon. On a GAAP basis, this repurchase resulted in a $12 million other expense due to the acceleration of noneconomic interest expense. ", "On the balance sheet, gross cash and short- and long-term marketable securities decreased by $10 million to $5.27 billion with free cash flow largely offsetting the repurchase of convertible debt. Cash and marketable securities net of debt at maturity value increased by $212 million to $3.34 billion. Cash flow from operations in Q3 was $176 million inclusive of an increase in inventory and receivables. Inventory increased by $131 million as Fab 5 output ramped across the quarter, and inventory in petabytes grew from an extremely lean 6 forward weeks at the end of Q2 to 7 forward weeks at the end of Q3. This is 1 week less than we had at the end of Q3 last year, so it is still on the low side as we enter the seasonal Q4. Retail channel inventory also ended Q3 on the low side at 5 weeks compared to 6 weeks at the end of Q3 last year. Accounts receivable increased sequentially by $88 million as constrained inventory levels resulted in sales being more concentrated in September. ", "Q3 investing activities yielded a positive $13 million of cash with the fab joint ventures returning more cash to SanDisk than was needed for fab investments and capital equipment purchases. Year-to-date, our fab and nonfab capital investments have totaled $832 million and the associated cash outlay has been only $348 million with the difference funded by joint venture working capital. The dollar value of our yen-based off balance sheet lease guarantees for fab equipment decreased by almost $200 million to a balance of $545 million at the end of Q3. ", "I'll now turn to forward-looking commentary. Please note that non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation tables for all applicable guidance are posted on our website. ", "We expect continued demand growth and supply/demand balance in the fourth quarter. Our revenue forecast for the fourth quarter is $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, which would result in 2011 revenue in approximately the same range we indicated in July and at the high end of the range we provided at the beginning of the year. ", "Turning to gross margin. The yen exchange rate, which we experienced for Q3 wafer purchases, will put increased pressure on fourth quarter costs. We expect Q4 noncaptive usage and Fab 5 startup costs to be similar to Q3, and the 24-nanometer transition will continue to be the primary driver of cost reduction in Q4. We forecast Q4 non-GAAP product gross margin of 38% to 40% and total non-GAAP gross margin, including license and royalty of 42% to 44%. ", "Non-GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter are forecasted at $225 million to $235 million with the expected increase coming primarily from growth in our R&D investment level and the seasonal increase in sales and marketing spending. This fourth quarter forecast would bring full year non-GAAP operating expenses to approximately $850 million, equal to our beginning of the year forecast even after our acquisition of Pliant Technology, and at the low end of our long-term OpEx model of 15% to 17% of revenues. We expect Q4 non-GAAP other income of $5 million to $10 million and a non-GAAP tax rate of 33%. ", "Our estimate of 2011 capital investment in fab and nonfab equipment remains unchanged at $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion with significant investments in Q4 for both 24-nanometer and 19-nanometer technology transitions and Fab 5 capacity ramp. We expect to fund a portion of the Q4 capital investment with new operating leases and we now expect cash usage for 2011 capital investments to be significantly less than the $800 million to $900 million that we forecasted early this year. ", "In summary, our business model and our focus on execution continues to produce robust profits and free cash flow. Our 2011 forecast reflects all metrics in line with or better than the estimates we provided at the beginning of the year, including revenue growth, cost reduction, gross margin, operating margin, capital investment and cash generation. We will now open the call for your questions.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Judy. Thank you, Sanjay. [Operator Instructions] Jay?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will go first to James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I guess, first off, on the supply side of things for a second, you talked about in 2012 U.S. mate that your captive bit supply is going to increase by more than it did in 2011. Any kind of a quantitative estimate on how much it would increase and how that compares to your expectations for the industry?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "In terms of our captive bit supply growth, it will increase somewhat greater than 75% in 2012. And of course, that will depend on our 19-nanometer transition next year, the yields of 19-nanometer as well as the additional capacity from Fab 5. So I think at this point, that's the best estimate that we can provide. Of course, keep in mind that we will continue to utilize some level of noncaptive supply in 2012 as well similar to what we used in 2011.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Understand. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, can you talk about where we are on the ramp of X3 or TLC sales at this point? Where do you think the ceiling on those sales might be as a percentage of your bit shipped and anything more you're seeing from competition in terms of their ability to ship it?", "Judy Bruner", "In terms of our X3 usage, it remains above 50% and it's actually been more than 50% of our revenue for more than 2 years now. So we've had a very consistent usage of X3 and we expect that to continue into next year. We continue to believe that we are far ahead of the competition in terms of usage of X3.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Daniel Amir with Lazard Capital Markets.", "Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "A couple of questions here. First of all, on the gross margins outlook here for Q4, can you give us a better idea? You said that your -- the Fab 5 output throughout the quarter, ending the quarter, is -- was quite good going into Q4 here. So can you help us a bit understand kind of the different moving factors of your gross margin guidance? And how should we look at that going into kind of the first quarter of the year? And then I have one follow up.", "Judy Bruner", "Okay. In terms of the gross margin, product gross margin guidance, for the fourth quarter of 38% to 40% relative to the 40% that we just achieved in Q3, the primary factor is that the yen has continued to appreciate and appreciated in the wafer purchases that we made in Q3, which will be a factor in our fourth quarter gross margin. At this point, the Fab 5 startup costs we expect will be at a similar level in Q4 relative to Q3, and we expect noncaptive usage to also be a similar mix in Q4 as in Q3. And so it's really primarily the yen and then, of course, whatever product mix we have during the quarter will also be a factor.", "Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And the other question is can you give us a bit more clarity on kind of your SSD business? It seems like it's doing well, maybe even better than expected here since you bought the Pliant business. I mean, how should we look at it going into next year in terms of impact on your sales, percentage of your business? I mean, do you expect the PC market to really take off next year? Or is that more the focus for 2013?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So first of all, on the enterprise side of the business, we're really very pleased with the progress we are making, the product roadmap as well as the customer traction and the rapid increases in the revenue that we are experiencing. So that part of the business is going very well and I think tremendous opportunity for us for the future. On the client SSD side, we are really seeing these Ultrabooks unfold and that definitely is driving increased adoption of SSD in the PC space. We only said that we have focused on the thin form factor of SSDs as the leading opportunity for our business. And I think Ultrabooks are certainly validating that as well. And in terms of our high-performance SSDs and we have project launched in retail well-received and also with the high-performance SSD with respect to the OEMs, we are engaged in continuing to drive that opportunity for our business. So certainly, next year, both from the enterprise side, as well as on the client side, we would be expecting a significant growth in our business coming from that category. And I can't really give you specifics in terms of the numbers, our percentages for next year, but what I would like to tell you is that over the course of the next few years, we would certainly expect our SSD business enterprise as well as the client SSD combined to really become something in the neighborhood of 25% of our revenue. So really, tremendous growth opportunity and we feel we are well-positioned here.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Uche Orji with UBS.", "Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Sanjay, let me just start off by asking you about the tablet shakeouts you described at the beginning and what that means for the design win pipeline that you had referred to at the beginning of the year when you were talking about product design wins. So where does that put the pipeline of production to ramp? Where should we expect growth to come in terms of a future embedded2 growth?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So with respect to the tablet shakeout that we have said, we have been engaged with the entire ecosystem of tablet manufacturers. And we had always said that some of these devices may do well in the market and others may not. And I think you have better reports in the market. And certainly, the first generation of tablets, several of these tablets have not done as well in the marketplace. So that's what we meant by indicating the tablet shakeout. But in terms of our design wins, design wins actually continue to have strong momentum in tablets and, of course, in smartphones for our embedded products, so really, a continuing momentum on the design wins side in the tablet category. And of course, second-generation tablets are starting to come out and you're going to see more of them in the future. And really, this category continues to be a very large opportunity for us and we are well-positioned with our strong embedded products here.", "Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "But so between handsets and tablets, where should we expect most of the growth to come from? Because I think many people are still very skeptical about a tablet market outside of the iPad. So can you kind of quantify what the embedded handset outlook is?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We are really continuing to see strong growth opportunity for our business, both in mobile phones, including smartphones, as well as the tablet category. So not really breaking it out between tablets and smartphones, but both are strong growth drivers. I think you'll see that tablets are going to increase -- use large amount of flash in the future, and the numbers for tablets as a category are continuing to grow strongly and same thing for flash. So both of these will really continue to drive opportunities for us. Really, these devices now have become really an indispensable device for people. These have become a lifestyle opportunity as well as a productivity tool. And flash is really playing a key role in these devices. And these devices, I mean, there's a whole range of them available in the more affordable category such as the recent Kindle Fire as well as the high-end devices that you see out in the marketplace. What that means is really significant global expansion and significant increases in aggregate opportunity for flash in this category. And with our products, both on iNAND side as well as other components of flash, we are well-positioned in this entire ecosystem to drive the opportunity ahead.", "Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Separately, Judy, you talked about inventory you characterized as being lean, I'm sure, looking at a number of days of inventory jump from 66 to 78. What is the comfortable level of inventory for you? I mean, because some people disagree with 78 days as being lean just given the recent trend. But anyway, we can understand what is the comfort level for you here.", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. I've long said that approximately 8 weeks of inventory on a forward-looking basis is around the right level for our vertically integrated supply chain model. So as I said at the beginning of the third quarter, we were 6 weeks forward-looking. That's very lean. We've entered the fourth quarter at about 7 weeks forward-looking, which is more comfortable. But generally, about 8 weeks is about the right level. You have to keep in mind that we own inventory in the fabs and then although in work-in-process and, of course, finished goods and, in some cases, in hubs for our OEMs as well as, in some cases, consignment with large retailers. So we have a very vertically integrated and long supply chain model, and that's where the approximately 8 weeks comes from.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Of course, the disaster in Thailand is putting constraint on hard disk drives. Do you see this as -- are you getting calls already or -- for solid-state drives that help support some of the demand?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So in terms of the Thailand flood situation and its impact on the hard disk drive industry, really, it's really too soon to speculate on any impact on demand for SSDs. And let me just point out that our own supply chain for SanDisk products is not impacted by the Thailand floods at all.", "Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And maybe talking about the 19-nanometer process node, do you expect that product to be able to go into SSDs also? Or is that going to be constrained to other applications?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Well, absolutely. I mean, as we ramp up 19-nanometer in the future, we will be applying that product to the SSD product line also.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "I'm wondering about the SATA DEVSLP initiative for you. Where are we in that process? And what sort of role is SanDisk playing in that? Is that a first mover advantage for you in that marketplace?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So this is a standard that is -- interface standard that's being driven by Samsung, Microsoft and Intel. And we are certainly engaged with the developments in this area and absolutely as we have always emphasized our engagement with the ecosystem to continue to drive opportunities on the OEM side of the business, and we definitely look forward to SSD fortunately unfolding in this regard in the future as well.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "I guess I'm kind of curious about the timing. And how different is that from what's underway today? And does that specifically -- I know it's an ultra-low power standard. Is that specifically involving some of your 3-bit-per-cell X3?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "It basically is evolving right now, and we are definitely looking at this opportunity building with our products. And our products will support this standard.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Is there any difference between the enterprise market and the portable market in terms of their willingness or ability to use X3? Or is it equal in both categories?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "With respect to X3 utilization today, of course, SSDs are just MLC memory and, in the case of enterprise, some level of SLC as well. And therefore, we are focused on for near term as well. X3 memory in the clients' SSD side will certainly get utilized as well. And in fact, for our modular SSDs, we will continue to increase that as well. But on the enterprise, it will be primarily MLC and some level of SLC, non-X3 on the enterprise side.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Srini Sundararajan with Oppenheimer.", "Srinivasan Sundararajan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "My questions is do you think that this sort of problem in Thailand regarding the flood and the -- actually gives you an opportunity to perhaps reduce the prices a little bit more to increase the incorporation of SSDs into PCs?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "As I mentioned earlier, it is really too soon to speculate on the impact of the Thailand situation on the SSD market.", "Srinivasan Sundararajan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. My question was, I think, could you probably maybe reduce prices on the SSD side so that you could gain a larger market share?", "Judy Bruner", "I don't think that we would engage in price reduction strategy in reaction to this environmental issue. We're very focused on continuing to deliver robust profitability and we feel that there's a good supply demand balance for our business in the current quarter.", "Srinivasan Sundararajan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Next question is have you recognized these revenues from your client purchase so far?", "Judy Bruner", "Yes, we definitely have. We're very happy with how that business is proceeding.

Now if I look at -- Judy, if I look at the underlying cost reduction, I mean, I get 47% kind of full year cost reductions, excluding the impact from the fab startup cost and noncaptive mix. So when we look into kind of cost reduction for next year, what arrangements are you guys making in terms of yen hedges that can kind of give us the confidence that you can kind of remain on this kind of trajectory for cost reductions next year?", "Judy Bruner", "Okay. So you're right, we're very pleased with the level of cost reduction we have achieved so far this year despite the fact that the yen has appreciated against us since the Analyst Day at the beginning of this year, and we are definitely still in the cost reduction range that I provided back at the Analyst Day even despite the appreciation of the yen. So very good performance. In terms of next year and how we're dealing with the yen, we are following a similar strategy to what we did in the latter part of 2010, which is to hedge a portion of next year in order to reduce variability. And we are working to hedge approximately 50%, at least 50%, of next year. We are not at that point yet. We have so far hedged approximately 30% of the yen purchases that we expect for 2012. Of course, we can't escape the market. And so the rates that we are locking in, we're at market rates. But we are trying to protect the downside in terms of any further appreciation of the yen.", "Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then how many at 10% customers you had in the third quarter? I believe you reported one 10% customer in the second quarter, and was it the same customer in the third quarter?", "Judy Bruner", "We did not have any 10% customers in the third quarter. And that just demonstrates the very broad diversity of our customer and channel base.", "Operator", "We'll go to James Capello [ph] with Columbus Circle Investors.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "I was just wondering, given the inventory build, the sequential growth rate I'm seeing for revenue for the fourth quarter, can you kind of give us a range or some detail into the ASP decline and the gigabyte growth sequentially for 4Q?", "Judy Bruner", "We haven't been giving guidance, specific guidance, on price decline or gigabyte growth. Of course, both are incorporated in the revenue range we provided. But I will tell you that we feel that our business is experiencing supply/demand balance in the fourth quarter. And we feel very good about the level of revenue growth, both on a sequential and a year-over-year basis. And we feel very good about the gross margins that we've guided to for the fourth quarter, which despite the appreciation of the yen are materially higher than what we had anticipated at the beginning of the year.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ryan Goodman with CLSA.", "Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "I had a couple of questions on the SSD business. So first, you had mentioned that total SSDs are heading to somewhere in the 25% ballpark for total business. Any chance you could give us an idea of where the total business is today? And then also, specifically on the enterprise side of the business, I know you have launched several fast drives in the past quarter. Any thoughts on the long-term roadmap with PCI Express and SATA? Are these areas you need to, or plan to get into?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So first of all, on the SSD revenue, at this point it is small, and I was indicating earlier that in a few years' timeframe, we would expect it to become 25% or higher of our total revenue. So that's in a few years timeframe. And we are making, really, as I indicated, strong progress there. And on the enterprise side, the revenue today is all fast drive space and we do have a roadmap for PCI products and we will be introducing them in the first half of next year.", "Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "Okay. And then on -- just a side question, the cash is still relatively high and growing. You have about $15 net cash. Now it sounds like the cash requirement at least for this year with Fab 5 has gone down quite a bit. I'm still not sure, I guess, on next year, but we can see you started buying back some of the debt. And maybe just share the strategy you have with this going forward, if there's going to be buybacks, further debt reductions or more M&A.", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. Of course, the first priority for our cash is always the capital investment level for the business. We are a very capital intensive business, and we want to make sure that we always have ample cash on hand to fund those capacity investments. A key second priority is any strategic investments that we could choose to make from time to time, and the Pliant investment that we made in the second quarter is a key example of that. I expect that there is always a potential that we could repurchase more of the convertible debt, although getting it at the right price is what's most important. And so we'll be opportunistic if something comes along. In terms of share repurchase, we do not have a share repurchase program in place, but I don't rule out that that is something that we could look at from time to time in the future. The last time that we did repurchase stock was in 2007. In terms of an overall broad answer, I would give you that we think we have significant opportunity to invest within our business over time, and that's the primary reason that we want to hold a ample amount of cash on the balance sheet.", "Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "Okay. Is that cash mostly in the U.S. or is it overseas?", "Judy Bruner", "It is primarily in the U.S.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.", "Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "This year has been a really good year for the company to broaden out its embedded design wins. And given the progress that you've made, both in smartphones and tablets and in eReaders. I'm wondering, as you think about growth for 2012, is growth in the mobile business and embedded really a unit growth game? Or are you growing with the market? Or are you seeing new customer for new market segment opportunities? And relative to those, which would be the bigger growth opportunity for SanDisk next year?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So I think the mobile category, smartphones and tablets, will continue to be a very large growth category for us. And certainly, it is both unit growth opportunity as well as average capacities continuing to increase in categories such as smartphones and likely tablets as well. So it really is a combination of the 2. And as I pointed out earlier that all this profusion of mobile devices is really only continuing to increase the aggregate opportunity for NAND flash in the future. And also, of course, for next year, we are looking at revenue growth, strong contribution coming from SSD side of our business, the Ultrabooks, the client as well as the enterprise. So these, really, will start becoming strong growth drivers for our business, both mobile as well as the SSD, while the legacy markets of USB and imaging will continue to be strong markets as well.", "Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Sanjay, and on the subject of solid-state drives and PCs, obviously, there's a lot of energy with some of the component players with the Ultrabook initiative. As you think about the average densities for SanDisk, what do you -- what's a reasonable way for us to think about average densities for SanDisk in 2012 in your consumer SSD business?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "In the consumer SSD business, I mean, it will -- in the Ultrabook category, there are -- if you include, there are both SSD-based Ultrabooks as well as Ultrabooks that will be having hard drives as well as SSD on a file by file basis for caching purposes. So this average capacity in the consumer devices will really very much depend upon the mix of these devices as they unfold. So this is really all very evolving market. We are prepared to address it. There's a complete lineup of products, but this -- really, time will tell in terms of what exactly is the mix of the average capacity. And that will very much depend upon the mix of purely SSD-based Ultrabooks versus hard disk drive plus lower capacity flash that I had mentioned earlier. But the bottom line is that all of these units are continuing to implement and drive additional opportunity for flash, just increasing the time for flash.", "Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. If I could, Judy, the company's mentioned a bit growth range for next year. Since you're talking about next year's bit growth, is it possible to give us some parameters for CapEx?", "Judy Bruner", "It's too early to give a specific range for capital investment for next year. But I will tell you that at this point in time, we would expect to be ramping Fab 5 for 9 months out of the 12 months of next year and, of course, to have the investment that goes along with normal technology transition as well as nonfab capital investment. And as you look at this year, it just so happens that in 2011, we also had a ramp of fab capacity for 9 months out of the year because we were ramping Fab 4 in the first quarter of 2011 and then Fab 5 in the second half of 2011. And of course, we had tech transition in nonfab capital equipment. So those are the key factors, but we're not ready to give a specific range yet.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Bob Gujavarty with Deutsche Bank.", "Bobby Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Judy, I agree with you, the inventory doesn't look too bad at the moment. But I'm kind of concerned given that Fab 5 output is ramping, and we do have seasonality staring us in the face in 1Q. Is there some other puts and takes that I'm not aware of, perhaps, the noncaptive starts to roll off at some point that kind of balances out some of the potential for inventory to balloon here?", "Judy Bruner", "That is, one of the benefits of our strategy of using noncaptive is that we can always tailor back the noncaptive. And at present, we would expect noncaptive usage in the fourth quarter to be similar to the 11% that we used in Q3. So, yes, that is a factor. And at this point, I'm not concerned about the inventory levels as we enter 2012.", "Bobby Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Fair enough. The other thing I was curious about is are you guys seeing any kind of, perhaps, separation of competition, particularly at the high density parts of the NAND market given your TLC advantage, your node advantage, your manufacturing advantage? Do you notice that, perhaps, in the higher capacity, higher density configurations that it's become a little less competitive as some of the less technologically capable NAND vendors to just concentrate on the low density parts of the market?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Certainly, in the high-end capacity markets, our X3 certainly gives us an advantage and gives us a significant competitive advantage. And not only in terms of the capacity of the memory dye itself, but our X3 dye allows us to achieve to allow it to pack higher capacity of flash memory in packages such as microSD, where you can't really fit the highest capacity X2 memory whereas you can fit X3 memories in them. So it certainly gives us advantage in terms of offering high-capacity solutions. Keep in mind that our advantage is not only from X3. Our advantage, particularly in embedded, also comes from things like adaptive flash management that we have talked about. And nowadays, especially with all the tablets and smartphones really packing in more and more features and performance in them, it's really requiring flash solutions to deliver increasing capability in terms of performance. And that, again, really works well for us in terms of performance that we're able to achieve through our Adaptive Flash Management. All of these things position us well certainly for the high-capacity requirement of the market.", "Judy Bruner", "Bob, this is Judy. I just want to go back to the question you asked about inventory and point out that, as Sanjay described, we expect to complete the current phase of capacity expansion in Fab 5 at the end of January 2012 and then take a 3-month pause. And so the timing of that is actually good in terms of the seasonality factor of Q1 that you raised. So keep that in mind as well as you think about inventory. So there's really the flexibility that we get from noncaptive as well as, what I believe, is a very prudent ramp of Fab 5 as we go into 2012.", "Operator", "The next is Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Just wondering what's the mix of TLC was in Q3 and what's it for Q4, and again, same thing on 19-nanometer and 24-nanometer?", "Judy Bruner", "Our 3-bit-per-cell mix continued to be above 50% in Q3 and we expect it to be above 50% in Q4. We're not being more specific than that for competitive reasons.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "And we would expect similar trend to continue in 19-nanometer as well.", "Judy Bruner", "Yes.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Got it. Okay. And then second question, on Fab 5, by end of January, what will be utilized? How much will that be utilized?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So by end of January, with the current commitment of expansion completing in Phase I, Phase I would be about 20% utilized in terms of capacity.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And last question here. On the SSD side, I know you mentioned seeing nice pickup. What are your expectations for that growth next year versus this year?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Certainly, our SSD expectation is large. The SSD in 2011 has been -- is rather small, a revenue contribution for us, although, as we mentioned, the enterprise SSD revenue is on our fab samples as well as client SSD going well. 2012 is really when we expect SSD, both on the client side and the enterprise side, to become meaningfully a large opportunity. And we expect certainly strong growth rates for this part of our business in 2012.", "Operator", "And our last question is a follow-up from Uche Orji with UBS.", "Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Sure. Sanjay, can I just ask you about your comments earlier at the beginning when you talked about clients -- the vertical integration model being a key differentiation for you in SSD? If you spoke to independent controller companies, they will talk about the flexibility they have.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Uche, you're breaking up quite badly. ", "[Technical Difficulty]", "Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Now so when you were at the part of beginning, you talked about the vertical integration model as being a key differentiator for you when we're describing clients. I'm just trying to understand how you balance the advantage of being able to have a lower cost by being integrated vis-a-vis a flexibility that independent controller companies bring to the table. I'm just trying to understand if you can give us more color into that statement when you made it.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So really, there's tremendous benefit of vertical integration in enterprise. First of all, memory. Memory dominates the cost of enterprise SSD solutions. And our ability to manufacture the memory at the lowest possible cost is certainly a plus for leadership in that part of the business. However, even more importantly, the SSD's roadmap are working with our controller engineers, software engineers as well as memory technology engineers under the same roof to develop the roadmap for next few years is really a big plus because that's where we can optimize the memory as well as the system implementation to achieve the highest reliability and the highest performance and highest level of predictable performance, which is required in enterprise applications. So all of these things really, the memory cost and the ability to supply the enterprise customers' requirements in volume as well as the benefit of vertical integration on the technology and controller side, position us well there.", "Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So I mean, if we look at a year like this, where you've been mostly supply constrained, won't an OEM look at that and think how that much for that would be flexible and use companies that can source NAND from everyone else as opposed to one that's lumped in. And I'm just trying to think how an OEM will make that decision when it looks at your model versus start acquiring newer company that can buy NAND from somebody else?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "I can tell you that OEMs really are delighted to have SanDisk be a supplier of enterprise storage solutions, and they really value the supply base of flash memory as well as the vertical integration capability that, really, client brings us for this marketplace in terms of leading edge solutions, both flash drive and for the future roadmap of PCI as well. So they really look at, again, the benefit of technology, strong roadmap, capacity, reliability and all of these. They can trust that SanDisk will be a reliable partner for them in terms of delivering all their leading edge solutions. So really, big plus and customers are delighted at this.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Mark Newman with Sanford Bernstein.", "Mark C. Newman - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Just a couple of questions. On the cost down for 2012, could you give me some guidance on how that may play out? And are you seeing the cost down actually declining from what we have seen historically? And following on from that, I'd like to get some kind of viewpoint from you either on the ASP trend which I know you don't like to talk about too much going forward, but perhaps, you could talk about supply/demand balance going into 2012. I think a lot of investors have raised concern about several suppliers increasing their supply at the end of this year and going into 2012 and concerned about what is it going to -- what's going to be the supply/demand balance going to 2012. So any kind of comments about that would be very helpful also.", "Judy Bruner", "Okay. Sure, Mark. So first, on the cost downs for 2012, it is clearly too early to give any specific guidance on the cost down for 2012. But our cost improvement next year will -- the primary influencers to that cost improvement will be both the 24-nanometer transition, which is continuing through the end of this year and into early next year and will be a driver of cost reduction; and then, of course, the 19-nanometer transition. So those are the 2 primary drivers. And it is true that as we move further and further along the scaling path of NAND that the cost reduction capability is reducing as we move through each node, and that is something that will influence us as well as everyone else in the industry. But we feel very good about our cost that we see for our 19-nanometer technology. Other factors in terms of cost down for next year is that the Fab 5 startup costs should be much less of a factor. We will have some in Q1 and then they should be done for next year. Noncaptive mix, I would expect, would be less of a headwind in 2012 than it was in 2011 because in 2011, we were moving from essentially a no noncaptive in 2010 to a higher usage in 2011. So that will be less of a year-on-year headwind. And then, of course, there's the yen, which will, at this point, does look like it will be a headwind and will be influencing the cost down for next year. But those are the key factors, and we'll provide more guidance on the cost downs in the early part of 2012. In terms of supply/demand balance, we, at this point, are optimistic about supply/demand balance for 2012. We see very strong secular demand drivers for our business, many of which we have talked about today. And at the same time, we think we are being very prudent in terms of our capacity expansion and we're really trying to balance prudent capacity expansion and also being able to meet the demand that we see for next year. So we feel good about the supply/demand balance and, therefore, the overall pricing environment that we expect to see in 2012.", "Mark C. Newman - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Great. That's very helpful. And just one other quick follow-up question actually. Do you give any guidance or can you give any guidance on your product mix embedded versus removable probably?", "Judy Bruner", "Well, for the third quarter, the embedded was approximately 40% of our OEM business.", "Jay Iyer", "Thanks a lot.

Welcome to Western Digital's third quarter financial results for fiscal year 2009. (Operator Instructions).", "Now I'll turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.", "Bob Blair", "Thank you. I want to mention that we will be making forward-looking statements on our comments in response to your questions concerning inventory levels in the June quarter, our ability to respond to future changes in demand, future investments in technology, and acceleration of our solid state drive programs by the intellectual property and technical expertise added through our acquisition of Silicon Systems, results of our restructuring activities and our expected cost and savings from these activities, our continued profitable growth, capital expenditures and deprecation and amortization for fiscal year 2009, and our financial results expectations for the June quarter, including revenue and gross margin, expenses, share count, restructuring costs, share count, and earnings per share.", "These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on January 29, 2009, as well as the additional risk factors reported in the press release included as Exhibit 99.1 to the form 8-K we furnished to the SEC today. ", "We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events and you should not assume later in the quarter that the comments that we make today are still valid.", "In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the differences to the comparable GAAP financial measures in our press release included as Exhibit 99.1 to the form 8-K that we furnished to the SEC today, a copy of which can be found under the SEC filings link in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.westerndigital.com.", "I'd also like to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investor section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of this call. ", "I would now like to turn the call over to John Coyne, President and CEO of Western Digital. ", "John Coyne", "Thanks, Bob. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today.", "We are pleased with our March quarter financial performance. A result of crisp execution by the WD team, maintaining a focus on profitability and cash generation. We managed our market participation, product mix, and costs to optimize our returns in the challenging environment. ", "We maintained our overall market presence while holding gross margins flat with last quarter.", "Demand for ATA hard drives in the March quarter remain depressed from year ago levels, falling 12% year-over-year and 9% sequentially to 103 million drives, due to the continuing effects of the worldwide economic downturn.", "This demand was slightly better than the 13% quarterly decline we had expected. WD took a disciplined approach to supply during the March quarter. We reduced production to match drive shipments, which were down by 8% year-over-year and 11% quarter-over-quarter to 31.6 million units. Additionally, we reduced finished goods by one million drives. ", "We are encouraged by the supply demand dynamic in the industry and response to customers\u2019 significant inventory reductions as they aligned with reduced demand levels, hard drive production was rapidly scaled back during the quarter. ", "Manufacturers inventories exiting the quarter for both 3.5 inch and 2.5 inch ATA drives were just over one week, while component inventory and distribution was at the low end of the normal four to six week range.", "As we anticipated, the pace and timing of demand reductions and inventory realignment have been different for the 3.5 inch and 2.5 inch markets. The 3.5 inch market is approximately 50% distribution and the majority of OEM supply chains are short, which drives air freighted to system assembly sites in the region of sale. ", "These supply chain characteristics lead to a very transparent and responsive market, which adjust rapidly to demand changes. In November and December, we saw this market undergo rapid demand decline, amplified by inventory adjustments in line with that demand change. The December quarter demand dropped by 8 million units or 12% quarter-over-quarter to 60 million units. We estimated that approximately half of this was inventory adjustment. March quarter, 3.5 inch ATA sales, were flat with the December quarter. ", "Distribution inventory was maintained flat as sell-out equaled sell-in, while manufacturers inventory was reduced by about one million units to one and one quarter weeks. ", "In contrast, the 2.5 inch market for hard drives is approximately 80% OEM with the majority using a China ODM assembly and ocean freight supply chain model. This, combined with the fact that this has historically been a high globe sector, meant that adjustments to the new market demand realities took somewhat longer to move through the chain. ", "Starting in January, we saw a massive inventory squeeze, which took 10 million units out of the market demand in the first two months of the quarter. This reduced demand from 53 million units in the December quarter to 43 million units in the March quarter, a 7% year-on-year and 18% quarter-on-quarter reduction.", "Again, the industry was quick to react on the supply side. Matching output closely to demand and additionally reducing manufacturers inventory by over 3 million units to 1.1 weeks of supply. ", "The industry built 12 million less 2.5 inch ata hard drives than in the prior quarter, a 20% quarter-on-quarter reduction in manufacturing activity.", "The balanced supply demand dynamic created in the quarter and the low level of inventory in both distribution and OEM channels are positives as we look forward into the June quarter; however, the most important determinant of our business performance in the quarter and into the second half of this year will be the true consumption trends. Significant uncertainty still remains about the magnitude of direction of end user demand. ", "We will keep our operations highly flexible to respond to whatever direction demand will take, while remaining highly focused on inventory, cash, cost, and profitability.", "The actions we have taken and are taking to resize and structure the business to remain profitable and cash flow positive at a $1.5 billion dollar revenue level are well advanced and are already showing up in our cost of goods and operating expense lines.", "While very focused on the control of operating expense, we continue to make substantial investments in future technologies and products. Indeed, despite the constraints of the current economic cycle and our consequent restructuring actions, we increased our March quarter R&D spending, excluding variable compensation, by 6% compared with the same period last year. This investment was funded by reductions in base SG&A of 10% year-on-year.", "Complimenting our internal investments, we are continuing our strategy of utilizing external developed technology by strengthening our relationships with industry-leading suppliers. In April, we concluded a new agreement with Showa Denko, extending our long-time partnership with them as a strategic supplier of advanced media.", "Our sustained investment in technology and product breadth continues to bear fruit. With our shipments of the industry\u2019s first two tiered drive growing throughout the quarter supporting multiple applications in our component and branded products business. ", "This week, we announced an additional version of this two (tiered) drive for the high duty cycle, business critical enterprise market, again demonstrating WD\u2019s ability to rapidly mature industry-leading technologies and mass production.", "We also extended our technology and product breadth during the quarter with the acquisition of Silicon Systems, which has become the WD solid state storage business unit with revenue in 2008 of $47 million and an established footprint in the industrial network communications, medical, aerospace, and military markets. The business is modestly accretive to WD. ", "The addition of Silicon Systems\u2019 technical expertise will accelerate WD\u2019s solid state drive development programs as we assess opportunity in the net book, client, and enterprise markets providing greater choice for our customers to satisfy all their future storage requirements.", "Integration into WD is well underway and proceeding according to plan.", "Our overall results continue to demonstrate the effectiveness of the WD business model in all environments.", "Tim Leyden will now review these results for the March quarter in more detail and provide our outlook for the June quarter. Tim?", "Tim Leyden", "Thank you, John.", "During the March quarter, the WD team continued its disciplined approach to market participation. Having sized capacity to match our expectation of demand, we paid close attention to the fundamentals of cash generation and profitability in a challenging macro economic environment.", "We did this by optimizing product mix, limited our participation in certain markets and concentrating on cost reduction and factory utilization. ", "We are pleased with the results of our actions to size the business to reflect demand realities that the industry faced and we sacrificed some near term share growth in order to make progress. ", "We are monitoring the market size and the supply demand balance and we are poised and well positioned to leverage our asset philosophy model to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities as the industry continues to cope with unpredictable demand patterns.", "Our revenue for the third fiscal quarter $1.6 billion, down 21% from the prior year hard drive revenue of $2 billion dollars, and down 13% sequentially. ", "Shipments totaled 31.6 million units, down 8% from the prior year and 11% sequentially. ", "Average hard drive selling price was approximately $50, down $2 from the December quarter and $9 from the year-ago quarter.", "Our Q3 ASP reflects a continued competitive pricing environment, particularly in the notebook market, where supply exceeded demand in the early part of the quarter and in the branded products market, where price degradation continued throughout the quarter. ", "Demand for our desktop products in the March quarter was stronger than historical season, resulting in increased volumes as compared to declines in all other markets. The strength in desktop was somewhat favorably impacted by replenishment of our customers\u2019 inventories. As they had cut back orders significantly toward the end of the December quarter. This synonym was more pronounced and happened earlier in the desktop market than in other markets. ", "WD\u2019s flexible supply model allowed us to quickly respond to these changes in the overall demand profile. ", "Demand for other products was affected most significantly by further inventory reductions driven by the overall weak consumer and commercial spending environment. ", "Our unit shipments of 2.5-inch drives were 10.1 million in the March quarter as compared to 10.2 in the year ago quarter and 13.8 million in the December quarter.", "In this market, in particularly in the earlier part of the quarter, we were selective in the business that we chose to pursue. We shipped 3.5 million 3.5 drives for use in digital video recorders in the March quarter as compared to 3.1 in the year-ago quarter and 4.1 million in the December quarter. Revenue from sales of branded products was $343 million as compared to $330 million in the year ago quarter and $403 million in the December quarter.", "Industry pricing was particularly competitive in this market. We believe this was primarily driven by a large competitor liquidating excess inventory. ", "With the industry\u2019s leading cost structure and compelling product lineup, we continue to view this market as a key contributor to WD\u2019s long-term profitable growth. ", "Hard drive channel revenue was 48% OEM, 30% distribution and 22% branded products in the March quarter compared with 50%, 34% and 16% in the year ago quarter, and 57%, 21% and 22% in the December quarter respectively. ", "The Q3 geographic split of our hard drive revenue was 26% Americas, 28% Europe and 46% Asia as compared to 28%, 31% and 41% in the year ago quarter and 23%, 29% and 48% in the December quarter. Demand strength in Asia, while more muted than in recent quarters due to the inventory correction in the 2.5 inch market, continues to be driven by the concentration of global manufacturing in that region and more recently by the affect of the Chinese government stimulus policy. ", "Our gross margin for the quarter was 15.9% down from the 22.6% we reported in the year ago quarter and flat with the December quarter.", "Total operating expenses of $192 million included $14 million charge for in process R&D related to the Silicon Systems acquisition and $4 million of cost associated with the restructuring plan announced in the December quarter. Excluding these restructuring charges, total on R&D and SG&A was $174 million for the March quarter, $13 million higher than the total R&D and SG&A reported in the December quarter. December OpEx benefited from a $16 million reversal of a prior quarter bonus accrual and a zero bonus for the period, whereas the March quarter included a $14 million bonus accrual. Adjusting for these changes, the R&D and SG&A for the March quarter was down $17 million dollars from December. ", "Restructuring charges related to the resizing plan we announced in December of 2008 have totaled $117 million to date, $4 million of which was incurred in the March quarter. We now expect the total cost of our restructuring to be about $122 million. This is lower than the $140 million forecasted on our January call. ", "We continue to expect the annual savings of the restructuring to be approximately $150 million once all actions are completed, including the $14 million in process R&D charge and $4 million restructuring charge, operating income was $61 million or 3.8% of revenue.", "Excluding these charges, operating income on a non-GAAP basis was $79 million or 5% of revenue.", "Interest and other non-operating expenses were approximately $3 million. This includes about $1 million of unrealized losses on our previously disclosed investments in auction rate securities. These investments totaled $18 million at the end of the quarter.", "Tax expense for the March quarter was $8 million. For fiscal 2009, we expect our tax rate to range between 8% and 10% as we take into account our expected continuing profitability and the global mix of income by region.", "Our cash tax rate is expected to be between 2% and 3% for the fiscal year. ", "Including the $14 million dollars in process R&D charge, and the $4 million restructuring charge, net income totaled $50 million, or $0.22 per share, excluding these charges, net income on a non-GAAP basis was$68 million or $0.30 per share.", "Turning to the balance sheet for the March quarter, our conversion cycle was 5 days, which consisted of 47 days of receivables outstanding 26 days of inventory or 14 turns and 68 days of payables. We generated $355 million in cash flow from operations. We paid out a net of $44 million related to the Silicon Systems acquisition.", "Capital expenditures were $106 million and depreciation and amortization expense totaled $119 million.", "Cash and cash equivalent increased by $203 million, ending at $1.6 billion dollars.", "In the June quarter, we will be paying out an additional $19 million related to the Silicon Systems acquisition, bringing the total net cash paid to $63 million. We will also be making our first quarterly debt repayment installment of $19 million. A summary of our debt repayment schedule was included in our most recent 10K filing.", "Capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 are expected to be about $500 million. This is consistent with the reduced forecast we provided on our January call.", "Depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2009 is expected to be about $480 million. We won\u2019t be providing a fiscal 2010 capital forecast during our July earnings call. ", "We did not repurchase any shares of stock during the March quarter. We continue to carry a healthy cash balance was we navigate the current economic downturn. We\u2019ll continue to manage our cash conservatively until demand visibility becomes clearer and the economic uncertainty abates. ", "Now I will discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2009. ", "You will recall that we indicated on several occasions that this quarter will be a 14-week quarter with our fiscal year ending on July 3, 2009.", "First, let me outline the market situation as we see it. Historically, the June quarter's sequential unit volume has been flat to slightly down. Global macroeconomic conditions remain challenging and while we have seen much progress toward inventory rationalization in the industry, we expect demand patterns to be less predictable than would be the case if normal seasonal conditions were present. Taking into account the inventory situation, our 14-week quarter and other known variables, we are modeling market volumes that will be essentially flat at the March quarter. We believe in a commodity market such as ours that balancing a supply and demand continues to be critical and we remain focused on maintaining that equilibrium. ", "Our sequential ASP declines have been about 5% and we anticipate the pricing will continue to be competitive. The production realignment undertaken by the 3.5-inch industry participants has led to a better balance between supply, demand and inventory holding patterns and we are now seeing that dynamic extend to the 2.5-inch marketplace. ", "Taking these factors into account, we expect current quarter revenue for WD to be in a range $1.45 billion to $1.6 billion. ", "We are modeling gross margin of 15.4%. R&D and SG&A are expected to total approximately $175 million. This includes the combined incremental impact of OpEx spending related to our recent acquisition, as well as the 14th week in our current quarter.", "Restructuring costs are expected to be $5 million. ", "Our net interest expense is projected to be about $4 million, assuming no further losses in our investments and securities. We anticipate tax expense of between $10 million. We anticipate our share count to be approximately $227 million. As a result, we expect GAAP EPS to be between $0.14 and $0.24. Excluding the $5 million of restructuring charges I outlined earlier, we estimate non-GAAP EPS of between $0.16 and $.26. This guidance excludes any impact from the possible disposal of our Sellawa facility. ", "Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Clearly this quarter you guys lost a little bit of share in 3.5 and 2.5 inch. What would be your plans going forward for share gains? Do you see a new pattern emerging where you want to be more cautious about share gains in your focus on profitability or do you still plan on additional share gains as we move through the year?", "John Coyne", "Our objective remains sustained profitable growth. Over the past five years or so, we\u2019ve been putting together a broad product portfolio addressing multiple segments of the market. We have been successful in growing our position in each of those segments to a substantial level. Having achieved that balanced business portfolio, that affords us the ability tactically in any given quarter to be able to address market conditions by segment and manage the portfolio to achieve solid overall results. ", "Where on an overall drive industry basis, we maintained share. We gained a little bit in desktop. We lost a bit in the 2.5 inch space. When I say we lost it, we know exactly where it is. We haven\u2019t actually misplaced it. As we look forward into the market, we continue with our profitable sustainable growth, we will continue to pursue growth in our existing market segments as that offers us appropriate rewards and continue to grow in new segments as we\u2019ve indicated an intention to enter the enterprise, mission critical space and with the recent acquisition of the solid state business unit. ", "So you can expect that WD will continue to pursue sustained profitable growth. ", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "In terms of gross margin, I\u2019m a little surprised that the gross margin guidance is down a bit. Is there anything particular we should think about there? Is that related to the 14-week quarter and do you see that as sort of a bottom for the gross margin?", "Tim Leyden", "When we look at the fourth quarter, generally it\u2019s our most challenging quarter from a historical and seasonal viewpoint. In this quarter, we will incur 14 weeks of utilization and we won\u2019t necessarily be able to have the sort of proportional increase due to the 14th week that we would normally anticipate. ", "Operator", "Next question comes from David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your participation in the net book segment. I know last quarter you said you were sort of shying away from that and are you developing a cost optimized product for that segment?", "John Coyne", "I don\u2019t recall indicating that we were shying away from net books. In fact we see the net book segment, which is one of the few areas in the computing and internet connected space and entertainment space that\u2019s actually growing. We see it as a significant opportunity. We think last quarter there was about $5 and $6 million net books shipped and our participation in that market was similar to our participation in our traditional notebook environment. ", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "Are your margins similar to the notebook margins as well?", "Tim Leyden", "Our margins are at the low end of our margin hierarchy, but low cost models we\u2019re very well positioned in order to be able to participate in that and we\u2019re satisfied with the margins that we\u2019re getting in that segment.", "Operator", "Rich Kugele with Needham & Company, your line is open. ", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "", "Can you give us a little color on the dynamics for gross margin improvement sequentially? Is it the effect of restructuring or do you have your own aerial density changes going on?", "Tim Leyden", "John indicated how we participated in the market by being tactically opportunistic and so from a mix viewpoint we benefited from that. Then we did benefit from the improvement in utilization as we had resized our business and of course we worked on cost like always do.", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "", "For the June quarter.", "Tim Leyden", "For the June quarter, we anticipate it to be the same thing as I indicated to Sherri. We won\u2019t be able to get the same proportionality increase on 14 weeks from a revenue viewpoint. Production, we\u2019re going to have to match production and cover the absorption for this proportionate overhead that\u2019s going to go into the manufacturing overhead.", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "", "Significant capacity has been taken out of the drive industry. Is there anything that gives you pause, John, that that has perhaps been impaired due to the downturn?", "John Coyne", "I think the fundamental structure in the supply base is sound. We\u2019ve certainly sized our business to the opportunities we currently see. Historically, if emerging opportunities showed up, we have a track record of being pretty good about addressing them. ", "We do expect to see some spot shortages that, for instance, a number of wafer fabs in Asia today are running flat out and last quarter they were completely empty or significantly reduced. ", "So there will be a little bit of jerkiness in the supply chain I expect over the next couple of quarters as people try to understand the macro environment and respond appropriately, but structurally and on a medium term basis, I don\u2019t see any fundamental issues. ", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "", "Inventory, have you started to see any rationality appear there at the OEM level? Are they starting to recognize that they aren\u2019t going to get the type of ASP declines that they\u2019ve gotten in recent quarters?", "John Coyne", "I think the OEM\u2019s behavior is always rational. When the industry is foolish enough to produce significantly above demand, then pricing power moves to the large customers and they behave very rationally in that kind of environment.", "Job one for every procurement officer in every major company is availability. And so, in times when supply is short to demand, that becomes the major concern of the procurement department followed by good value for money. ", "Operator", "Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal, your line is open.", "Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal", "First, Tim, on the cost saves that you\u2019ve identified, can you give us an update on timing?", "Tim Leyden", "We\u2019re on track for the conclusion during the June quarter.", "Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal", "The distribution between cogs and OpEx in terms of that $150 million?", "Tim Leyden", "It\u2019s about 60% OpEx and 40% cogs.", "Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal", "You mentioned that one of your competitors has been more competitive in the retail space or branded space. Has that impacted the margins of that particular business, which has been very profitable for you in particular, and how do you see that unfolding going forward?", "Tim Leyden", "I didn\u2019t indicate that one competitor was more competitive; I indicated that one competitor we thought was carrying out an inventory. So consequently that I think hurt wealth creation for many of us in the industry, but from a viewpoint of branded products and margins, we\u2019re now from a hierarchy viewpoint if we look at it with just knowledge to give insight but not to give too much away competitively. We have classified the margin hierarchy into three different stratifications. First stratification is the heavily engineered type products, which is the enterprise and the SSD type products and then the second stratification comes in the consumer type products. There\u2019s a cover for inventory carrying and other administrative overhead type of costs. So we have the second highest margin there.", "The third one comes in the commercial type products, which is desktop and laptop and of course the net book. \\", "Operator", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital, your line is open.", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital", "Could you just remind me, Tim, what our gross margin target is?", "Tim Leyden", "The gross margin model, the long-term gross margin model is 18% to 23%. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital", "Can you elaborate what\u2019s going on in the leadership position in the 2.5 inch, 250 per platter. Do you guys think you\u2019re there first? Do you think a few others will be there around the same time? ", "John Coyne", "Well clearly we led of the 250 gig per platter as we had done on the two previous generations. The next industry technology deployment will be 320 gig per platter in the 2.5 inch space and we fully expect to continue to be a leader in that space and we will on a broader context, you know, one of WD\u2019s long-time\u2019s strength has been our ability to manage the full portfolio of technologies within products and throughout our entire production chain, whether it\u2019s our extended chain of merchant suppliers and our internal component factories as well as our drive factories, to manage our mix there to optimize our return on investment and maximize our margins and we continue to do that. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital", "On the hedge strategy, is that similar to previous strategies internal plus external?", "John Coyne", "Absolutely. We have for a long time had an approach to those technologies which we had internalized, media, of having a significant minority of that business on the outside in the merchant market. We worked very closely with those suppliers, TDK, SAE, on the head side, and the primary partner on the media side and we worked very diligently with them to assure our access to and utilization of technologies that they can bring to our ability to integrate those technologies and take them rapidly to market and by doing so, manage risk and new product introduction as well as manage total capital investments and total technology investments in our own business while getting majority of our components from our internal structure, which has lessened cost in the total package, we believe has been very successful and believe it will be continue to be successful for us.", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital", "On the merger, do you think that leads to opportunities for you?", "John Coyne", "No deal is done \u2018til it\u2019s done, but for trying to predict the future, one tends to look at the past and certainly the last three mergers in the industry that included two parties with overlapping product lines resulted in opportunity for the non-merging companies in the industry. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital", "Suggest that that market share shift has already begun, do you agree with that?", "John Coyne", "I would agree with that, yes.", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital", "As we look to another competitor, (our check) is going to suggest that they have limited exposure in a lot of desktops, particularly N.A. a little bit and Europe, but only we\u2019re sitting around in Asia. Do you think anybody is changing their commitment to the industry, which could be a positive long-term fundamental?", "John Coyne", "It\u2019s very hard to tell. The model that we have developed allows us to operate very profitably and very well in the overall market environment as it exists today. So we don\u2019t rely on changes in the structure of the industry for our survival and overall future. So the industry doesn\u2019t have to change to make us successful, but changes in the overall structure could potentially be of benefit not only to us, but to the entire industry. ", "Operator", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stiffel Nicholas, your line is open.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stiffel Nicholas", "I want to understand the gross margin a little bit more. I think last quarter in reference to a question that was asked on the call, I think the comment was made that as the industry realigns itself and it looks like that definitely is taken shape, that you guys would be able to get back into your targeted gross margin level of 18% to 23%. So if you strip out the 14-week quarter, I guess I\u2019m trying to understand why we wouldn\u2019t be getting close to that 18% to 23% level again.", "Tim Leyden", "Well we sized the business to be profitable and cash flow positive at $1.5 billion dollars and obviously with the industry conditions being the way they were and that profitability, and we indicated it as well with our earnings expectation, was that it was just going to be right around break even. ", "And so, as we go forward into the future and it will be very dependent on what conditions stay present in the industry, obviously we\u2019ll have to grow a little bit from where we are at $1.5 billion. We probably have to grow somewhere to about halfway to what are previous revenue run rate was and then I think at that stage and with supply demand dynamics being somewhat in balance and our segment mixed in somewhat similar, then I think we can get to the low end of that 18% to 23% range under those conditions.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stiffel Nicholas", "So you\u2019re saying relative to the $1.5, take a halfway point to the $2.2 that you\u2019ve kind of done in recent history in terms of quarterly revenue?", "Tim Leyden", "Yes.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stiffel Nicholas", "And how much of an impact is the extra week in terms of the operating expense structure in this quarter and I\u2019m trying to think about that giving the full extent of the cost savings as we roll into September and there forward.", "Tim Leyden", "Yes, I think it doesn\u2019t compute to 14, 13, if you will, it probably computes more to like 13.75 in terms of what the OpEx run rate would be. ", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stiffel Nicholas", "Final questions for me. I want to make sure I have this clear. You\u2019re saying that your tax expense will be $10 million dollars, is that right? ", "Tim Leyden", "Yes.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stiffel Nicholas", "Okay, and then I guess I\u2019m just trying to understand on the SSD, the Silicon Systems acquisition, understanding where they\u2019re currently positioned, but can you speak to what addressable markets you really see in front of you for the SSD opportunity?", "John Coyne", "Sure. The SSD market, as we understand it in 2008, was about a $1.1 billion dollar market. That in context, our drive business in 2008 was a $35 billion dollar market. The projections that we\u2019re synthesizing from all of the forecasters and from discussions internal and external show about a $5 billion dollar opportunity for SSD, three to four years out, and a $14 billion dollar opportunity for HDD, three to four years out. ", "Within that, the $1.1 billion last year, about $400-$450 million of that was in bedded systems, which is in the markets that Silicon Systems addresses with current product line. We believe the balance was a split between enterprise tier-zero type applications and notebook and net book applications. ", "We think most of the growth is in the forecasted growth. Most of that is in the enterprise and client computing and net book spaces.", "Operator", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JPMorgan, your line is open.", "Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan", "You mentioned, John, that you extended your relationship with Show Denko. Does that mean that you guys maybe overpay for Komag or do you see the potential still for Komag to help you with your potential mission critical enterprise entry in terms of aluminum discs?", "John Coyne", "No, I certainly don\u2019t think we overpaid for Komag. I think our results over the time period since we bought Komag more than demonstrate the value of that acquisition to our business. ", "The Showa Denko relationship, and in fact we also have relationships with other merchant market media suppliers, as well as sub straight suppliers, you know, are part of our long-term strategy of how we do internal/external blending to get the best technology, costs, quality, and risk profile for the business, and we\u2019ve been consistent with that. We intend to continue to be consistent with that in mixing the majority, producing the majority of our internal heads in media, but buying a significant minority on a consistent basis over the long haul in the merchant marketplace.", "Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan", "Then as far as the earlier question regarding the proposed Fujitsu Toshiba merger, given Fujitsu\u2019s kind of shall we say inconsistent execution within the mission critical enterprise, do you see this as really a prime opportunity for you to maybe accelerate your entry into mission critical or do you really see mission critical not being the top priority for WD in terms of growth? ", "John Coyne", "Our approach to the enterprise business as we assessed the opportunity in that space for many years, that assessment did not look positive in that there were multiple form factors, multiple interfaces, very low volumes of all of them and relatively stable volumes of all of them and multi competitors, and that was not a good opportunity set from our perspective. To address that, the engineering effort relative to the potential sales just didn\u2019t map out. ", "Has the industry began to approach a series of transitions, 3.5 inch form factor to 2.5, studying cyber channel, then things began to look much different from our perspective with a segment of that mission critical market now standardizing on a 2.5 inch form factor with a sass interface, offering if you looked at that segment, which most forecasts indicate, will be by far the dominant sector over the next three years. That looks more attractive. ", "And so, we began investing in enterprise engineering some years ago and we are preparing to address the needs in that market. Now an interesting opportunity emerges as the tiering in that marketplace for high i-ops, high transactions, begins to see the advantage of solid state solutions against the multi-drive de-stroked, 15 K fiber channel solution to that problem.", "We see the opportunity to provide value to customers in the high end of the enterprise tier to compliment a mid-range sass space product and thereby be able to satisfy the total range of solutions on a forward-looking basis over the next several years. ", "Operator", "Scott Craig - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch, your line is open.", "Scott Craig - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch", "Can you guys comment on the impact that the bonus accruals will have in the coming quarter on the operating expense line. Secondly, how much cash did you actually had been taken out of the industry either in units or percentage when you think about both the 3.5 inch and the 2.5 inch based on your conversations with the industry?", "Tim Leyden", "Well on the bonus question, the accrual that we made this quarter is pretty typical, somewhere between $14-$20 million, actually between $10 and $20 million dollars, depending on how well the company is doing in absolute terms and relative to peers. ", "The second piece of question, capacity in the industry. I think what\u2019s much more important than capacity in the industry is utilization of that capacity and how people are running production relative to overall demand and I think there\u2019s some very positive signs there. I think the industry was tremendously responsive and fast in the last quarter and very disciplined in managing supply relative to demand. ", "I think the fact that over the last two quarters, our customers have taken about 10 million units out of inventory is another very positive sign, because when we\u2019re trying to understand the macro economic impacts and trying to understand the real end user demand activity in the market, eliminating that 10 million of disconnect between what\u2019s happening on the end customer side and what\u2019s happening on the supply side is very important to getting a good match between supply and demand.", "So I\u2019m very encouraged by all the behaviors I see and the fact that the inventory is not clouding the issue anymore. So now it becomes, the uncertainty is now around a true end demand and what the impacts of the macro economic environment are going to be on consumers and commercial demand.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley.", "Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "What was the headcount growth year-on-year if you net out acquisitions and how do you expect headcount to trend over the next couple of quarters?", "John Coyne", "I don\u2019t have the netting out the acquisitions necessarily closely to hand, but I certainly on a full year-over-year basis, we\u2019ve grown about 2,000 people. On a sequential basis, we\u2019ve come down 7,000 people from the December quarter.", "Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Is there more work you can do on that front the next couple of quarters?", "John Coyne", "We don\u2019t have any substantial plans in that area. We\u2019re pretty much done, with the exception of our facility where Tim mentioned we continue to operate that facility as we continue to explore closure or disposal. In either event, our headcount will come down by about 500-600 people at that point.", "Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "A quick follow-up, as it relates to the Silicon Systems acquisition, do you plan to add or integrate any of your own technology to their current solution or do you view that as largely a standalone business as you purchased it?", "John Coyne", "There are multiple facets to it. It is a revenue generator, a profitable business, that we will continue to pursue and we\u2019d like to grow our presence in those markets, which we don\u2019t currently. We didn\u2019t previously as WD, but there\u2019s also significant value from an engineering expertise and experienced perspective that we expect will have a positive effect when combined with our existing internal resources.", "I should clarify. We have grown by about 2,000 people on a year-over-year basis, but that does include the conversion of about 4,000 contract employees into full-time employees. So we\u2019re on a real apples for apples basis. We\u2019re down about 2,000 people on a year-over-year basis. ", "Operator", "Doug Reid - Thomas Weisel Partners, your line is open.", "Doug Reid - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Can you comment on which segments WD chose to step away from in order to maintain supply demand balance and what\u2019s driving those decisions?", "John Coyne", "Well I think the areas that we stepped away from a little bit, in 2.5 inch, we stepped back somewhat. We didn\u2019t like the reward ratio in that business at the beginning of last quarter. So we stepped a little away from that. We stepped into the 3.5 inch space, which was offering better reward for our energy at that time. ", "We also created some space in the branded products arena to allow what we saw as a required blowout of excess inventory.", "Doug Reid - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Can you comment on the opportunity to gain market share at the next technology 320 gig per platter?", "John Coyne", "That\u2019s the next technology and we\u2019ll announce products when we\u2019re shipping them. ", "Doug Reid - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Thank you.", "John Coyne", "Okay, I think we\u2019re done with questions. So in closing, I want to thank the entire WD team with strong results in such a challenging market condition are a testament to their adaptability, their perseverance, the capability and focus and motivation. ", "Despite the current state of the economy. We remain very encouraged by our long-term market opportunities. The applications driving digital content continue to multiply. Drive storage, delivering appropriately tiered, cost effective, high capacity storage, and high performance, low capacity transaction oriented solutions, will continue to provide great customer value in these markets and we remain committed to provide the best customer value proposition in the industry to deliver financial results, which allow us to continue making the substantial investments required to lead the industry and to generate superior returns for our supply partners, our employees, the communities in which we operate, and our shareholders.", "Thank you again for joining us today and I look forward to keeping you informed of our progress.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time I would like the turn the call over to Ms. Lori Barker Padon, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Lori Barker Padon, - Director of Investor Relations", "Thank you, good afternoon and welcome to the teleconference for SanDisk Corporation for the third quarter of 2006. I am Lori Barker Padon, SanDisk's Director of Investor Relations. Today with me is Eli Harari, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of SanDisk, Sanjay Mehrotra, President and Chief Operating Officer and Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President of Administration and CFO.", "The agenda for today\u2019s teleconference is as follows. Eli will start with remarks about SanDisk and trends in our markets. Judy will follow-up with our third quarter financial results and future guidance, and we will conclude the teleconference with your questions. Any non-GAAP financial measures discussed during this call as defined by the SEC in Regulation G will be reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

We do not intend to update information contained in this teleconference.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Eli Harari.", "Eli Harari \u2013 Chairman, CEO", "Thank you, Lori. In SanDisk's third quarter we continued to see the positive trends of our mobile comps that began several quarters ago. In Q3 the number of enhanced handsets that have a slot for a mobile card jumped to 648 models from 494 models in the prior quarter. Fully 49% of these models now support the microSD format including numerous new models from Nokia.", "Last week we announced our 2 gigabyte microSD cards in Japan in support of our launch of NTT DoCoMo where they release their older model such as new generation 3G phone that support microSD for the first time. Additionally, Sony Erickson in the third quarter was a 10% customer, and three out of our top 10 customers in third quarter were mobile card -- mobile phone manufacturers. In 2007 we expect high capacity mobile cards demand to accelerate particularly from the adoption of MP3 music, camera phones, with 3 to 7 megapixel resolution and the emergence of video in handsets as seen with the YouTube phenomenon. With the sheer number of handsets sold annually approaching the billion dollar mark we view the handset market opportunity for our cards and embedded solutions as the most important engine of Flash storage demand creation over the next few years.", "In the gaming segment we saw excellent sales growth of one-time programmable preloaded 3D cards. This is a 3D one-time programmable cards, and we are optimistic about the future prospect for 3D one-time programmable memory technology as an attractive content distribution medium for portable consoles and media players.", "In Flash MP3 players our U.S. retail unit share increased to 18% in August according to MPD and we continue to receive excellent reviews and customer interest for our Sansa e200 high-end players. Two weeks ago Best Buy and RealNetworks launched the Best Buy digital music store, it will be based on the new Sansa e200R which is especially optimized to work with real exciting new Rhapsody DNA. We believe that our strategy for penetrating this important market is working for us and that growing number of consumers are responding favorably to our value proposition and to the freedom of choice and access to protected content through an open platform. We believe that the corporation with Best Buy is indicative of the desire of major retailers to develop a compelling alternative to Apple\u2019s iPod.", "The personal media player PMP market is just around the corner. We have begun supplying Disney with preloaded movie cards on SD cards that are protected by our trusted Flash content protection security. These exciting new Disney PMP's which are shipping for the holidays in U.S. stores are targeted at kids 9 to 12 years old. The Disney PMP player sells for $99, and they are offering 6 full featured kid movies on these protected SD cards at 19.95 each, basically the same price as that of a DVD. We are very excited about this development, and we believe this market for preprogrammed premier content will grow nicely in the years ahead, both in standalone PMP players and more importantly in future handsets.", "In USB Flash drives, U3 recently announced the signing of the 10,000 application developer. U3 addresses the effect that standard USB Flash drives are basically an over performer as a floppy replacement but an under performer as a smart drive. Further more in the corporate world USB Flash drives are today viewed as a security risk by most IT departments. U3 applications are currently being developed by numerous corporations and third party developers and as the platform for smart personal storage space that is highly secured as well as corporate IT friendly. We believe the new U3 devices will dramatically transform the way mobile professionals work.", "The launch of Microsoft's Vista will further encourage Vista users to employ ready boost and ready drive Flash based devices to improve system performance. Speaking of personal computers, there is a growing interest in the growing NAND Flash memory in both desktop and notebook PC's. This trend goes handy with the view that proliferation of broadband will foster so called network service in the cloud to store a vast amount of personal data and communicate with personal computing platforms. This proliferation would create an opportunity for 10 to 20 gigabytes of on board non-Flash storage at the expense of resident hard drives. For this to happen, we believe the cost of Flash needs to come down by factors 2 to 4 times which we believe is well within the industry's ability in the next two years.", "Turning to the business side, aggressive pricing in the third quarter resulted in a 25% reduction in our ASP per megabytes sold. We were able to maintain product gross margins at the same level as in the prior quarter through excellent Flash yields on our captive 70 nanometer NAND MLC. We also completed the transition of Fab 3 from 90 nanometer to 70 nanometer and leveraged a strong growth in captive megabytes to reduce our third quarter reliance on the more costly non-captive sources. We believe that our vertical integration business model executed at the leading edge of non-MLC is allowing us to do well even under the challenging market conditions that have existed over the past few quarters.", "Looking forward to the fourth quarter we believe that Flash demand and supply are in reasonably good balance. Seasonally, strong Flash demand in consumer electronics in the fourth quarter is expected to absorb the existing and new supply coming onto the market. We're pleased to see some DRAM/NAND suppliers scrambling to increase their DRAM output by either diverting non-starts to DRAM or building new DRAM capacity ahead of NAND. This is due not only to the higher DRAM content required in Vista compliant computers but also due to the 60% or so traffic line of NAND in the past year that has made NAND substantially less profitable than DRAM except for those players that are at the leading edge NAND MLC.", "Just a few words on the M-System acquisition until the closing of the deal which is subject to M-Systems shareholders approval and Israeli court approval we continue to operate as two separate companies. We\u2019re engaged with M-Systems on planning net divisional organization in combining our respected businesses postpone. In summary, these are exciting times for SanDisk in our industry and we're very pleased with the numerous growth possibilities that we see in our target markets in the fourth quarter and 2007 and beyond. Judy.", "Judy Bruner - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President", "Thank you Eli and good afternoon everyone. Our total revenue for Q3 was a record $751 million just above the previous record revenue achieved in the seasonally strong fourth quarter of 2005. License and royalty revenue of $78 million grew 31% year-over-year and product revenue of $673 million was up 27% year-over-year. Our ASP per megabyte declined 25% sequentially more than we had forecasted due primarily to heavier promotions implemented in response to the competitive pricing environment during the quarter. Megabytes sold increased 40% sequentially more than the 20% to 25% sequential growth we had originally forecasted and compared to 23% sequential growth in the Q3 of last year.", "Retail revenue was 66% of product revenue in Q3, average capacity for retail products increased 16% sequentially to 882 megabytes and total retail megabytes sold increased 33% sequentially. Within the retail business, the highest sequential growth in megabytes sold and in revenue came from our USB and MP3 products.", "Looking at the retail business on a year-over-year basis, the strongest growth in megabytes sold and revenue came from our microSD cards for the mobile phone market and our MP3 players. Within the OEM channel, average capacity increased 27% sequentially and megabytes sold increased 59% sequentially. The highest sequential revenue growth came from our iNAND products for the mobile phone market and our 3D memory products for the gaming market. On a year-over-year basis revenue growth was strongest for microSD and Memory Stick PRO Duo cards both for the mobile phone market.", "On a geographic basis our product revenue mix in Q3 was 46% Americas, 36% Europe, and 18% Asia and Japan, a mix similar to the previous quarter. Q3 non-GAAP product gross margin excluding stock compensation was 32.7% compared to 32.8% in Q2. On a GAAP basis, the Q3 product gross margin was 32.4%, the same as in Q2. Product gross margin was slightly below the range we had forecasted in July due to the higher than expected decline in ASP per megabyte while our strong cost reduction enabled us to maintain a consistent gross margin quarter-to-quarter. Non-captive memory represented less than 10% of our shipments in line with our previous forecasts. Non-GAAP operating expenses excluding stock compensation and amortization of acquisition related intangible assets were $141 million, up $8 million from Q2 with the largest increase in R&D. GAAP operating expenses were $168 million, up $7 million from Q2.", "Excluding stock compensation and amortization of acquisition related intangibles, non-GAAP operating income was $158 million or 21% of revenue within our target financial model of 20% to 24%. Non-GAAP operating income for Q3 was approximately flat to last year's level due to the very benign pricing environment that existed in Q3 of last year while on a year-to-date basis our non-GAAP operating income is up 16% over prior year. We are pleased that our results are within our target financial model range even in a year of aggressive price decline.", "Other income increased to $32 million due primarily to higher cash balances and higher interest rates. Our tax rate in Q3 remained consistent with Q2 on a non-GAAP basis at 35% while on a GAAP basis our tax rate decreased slightly from 36.5% in Q2 to 35.7% in Q3.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $2.97 billion in cash short-term and long-term investments, up $286 million from Q2. Q3 cash flow from operations was $291 million, up from $209 million in the comparable quarter last year. We had anticipated a loan or lease guarantee to Flash partners in Q3. However, the need for this cash fell into October. During question we received an 8.5 million repayment of note receivable from FlashVision as the investment in the 200 millimeter fabs is now complete and the FlashVision business venture is now generating cash. We also made an initial investment of $4.3 million in Flash alliance which is the business venture for fab 4. Our fab related outstanding operating lease guarantees for Flash Partners and FlashVision stood at just under $500 million at the end of Q3. Accounts receivable day sales outstanding ended the quarter at 41 days down from 45 days at the end of Q3 reflecting good collections activity. Inventory increased by 18 million sequentially to 396 million in line with business requirements for the fourth quarter and channel inventory ended Q3 at about nine weeks similar to the level at the end of the Q2.", "I will now turn to our outlook for Q4. Let me remind you that the forward-looking comments I am about to make are subject to risks and uncertainties as described at the beginning of this call and in our periodic SEC filings, and we do not intend to update these comments or forecasts prior to our next quarterly conference call. It is our expectation that the M-Systems acquisition will close before the end of the year. However, since the actual close date is not yet determined at this time, and since purchase accounting is difficult to predict in advance, I will provide our outlook on a SanDisk standalone basis. I will, however, provide some input on how the acquisition may impact results post close. We expect the Q4 sequential decline in ASP per megabyte to be between 15% and 20% due primarily to traditional holiday sales promotions which would bring the annual ASP per megabyte decline for the full-year 2006 compared to 2005 to between 55% and 60%. We are forecasting Q4 sequential growth in megabytes sold to be 50% to 60%. Our Q4 forecast would bring the full-year to an increase in megabytes sold of approximately 200%. This is higher than we expected at the beginning of the year due in large measure to demand elasticity and strong growth in our mobile phone card business. We expect Q4 license and royalty revenue to be in the range of 85 to 90 million based upon estimates derived from recent reports of our licensees.", "We expect Q4 gross margins to benefit from a higher proportion of product built with our low cost 300 millimeter, 70 nanometer MLC memory, and we expect non-captive supply mix to remain at a level similar to Q3 due primarily to the higher yields and increasing output from Fab 3. Combining this with our forecasted price movement, we expect non-GAAP product gross margin for Q4 excluding stock compensation to be in the range of 33% to 35%. We expect GAAP product gross margin to be up to one half point lower than the non-GAAP product gross margins.", "We expect Q4 operating expenses to increase sequentially by approximately 30 to 35 million with the primary drivers being sales and marketing expenses related to holiday sales, 56 nanometer development costs, and legal costs for an ITC hearing in Q4. On the balance sheet, we expect a low level of fab investment in Q4 with Fab 3 expansion being funded primarily through operating leases. We expect approximately 200 million of additional Fab 3 operating leases in Q4 which will be covered by our guarantees.", "I will now turn to the impact of the M-Systems acquisition. We will record the results of M-Systems operations within SanDisk from the closing date forward. In addition to combining operating results, the purchase accounting for the transaction will impact revenue gross margin and expenses. On the revenue and margin side, any M-Systems deferred revenue existing at closing date does not get recognized. As a result there will be some one-time loss of revenue. Also purchase accounting requires recording of assets at fair market value. This means that we will write up M-Systems finished goods inventory at the time of the close to the expected sales price less selling costs which will reduce the gross margin when those finished goods are actually sold. Depending on when the transaction closes and the amount of deferred revenue and finished goods inventory at that time, these accounting requirements will impact the closed quarter and possibly the subsequent quarter.", "On the expense side there are several factors to keep in mind. In the quarter in which the deal closes, there will be a one-time charge for the value of in-process R&D, and there will be ongoing charges to the P&L for the amortization of intangible assets identified and valued in the purchased accounting. We also expect some limited restructuring charges originating from both companies as we determine how best to merge the businesses and infrastructures.", "The restructuring charges on the M-Systems side will become part of the purchased accounting and as a result are not expected to impact the P&L. The restructuring charges on the SanDisk side are not part of purchased accounting and instead will be recorded as expense in the quarter or quarters in which firm plans are established. Assuming the transaction closes in Q4, I will provide detail on these items in our January earnings call which given the complexities of the transaction is likely to be around the end of January, a few days later than in the past.", "In terms of the operating income, the operating impact of the M-Systems acquisition, excluding the impact of one-time charges and purchased accounting, we expect the transaction to be slightly dilutive in the early quarters but to be accretive on a cash or a non-GAAP basis by the end of year one as we are able to utilize some of our expanding captive supply to meet M-Systems demand and as we are able to derive revenue synergies particularly in the handset market.", "In summary, we are very focused on delivering a successful Q4 and on carefully planning and managing the expected SanDisk M-Systems close and subsequent integration. We'll now open the call for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Daniel Gelbtuch with CIBC.", "Daniel Gelbtuch - CIBC", "Congratulations on a very solid quarter. With respect to pro forma operating or guess non-GAAP operating expenses, wanted to do a little housekeeping. It looks like you had about 22 million change that was pro forma out. I was wondering how you split that between R&D and SG&A?", "Judy Bruner", "Sure, Daniel. There was actually about 25 million of stock compensation expense in the P&L, and let me give you a breakdown of that. There is 2.6 million in cost of sales. There is 10.3 million in R&D, 4.6 million in sales and marketing, and 7.7 million in G&A. And then the other GAAP to non-GAAP item is a line item that you see for amortization of intangible assets.", "Daniel Gelbtuch - CIBC", "Okay. Thank you on that. And then with regard you made mention of two to four X declines in NAND pricing to get the laptop market or to get the PC markets going with NAND. I was wondering, is there a dollar amount per gigabyte that you would say is a specific point to get there, obviously 2 to 4X is a very wide range.", "Eli Harari", "Daniel, I think that we've fully expect that solid state disk in other hybrid Flash devices following Flash will start showing up in the market in 2007, certainly with early adoptions, but at the current price of, like \u2013 about $0.02 per megabyte, 32 gigabyte drive even at the OEM level is still way too expensive except for early adopters. So, however, this market, it is not just a one- -- a kind of a step function. We continuously expect to see technology allowing us to bring the costs down, and that will allow this market to become the Flash solution to become more attractive. I would expect that by 2008 if you look at just historic cost and price reductions that we've seen over the last five years, extrapolate that on the next two years, 2008 this will become a more significant market and by 2009, 2010, I think it will become a very, very large market, at least that's what some marketing organizations are projecting, and I personally agree with them, but it won't happen except through -- I mean Flash really has got to come down in price.", "Daniel Gelbtuch - CIBC", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.", "James Covello - Goldman Sachs", "Good afternoon guys thanks so much. Just a couple of questions on the supply demand. I guess first, do you have any thoughts about some of the third parties that have come out and suggest that there could be some pretty significant excess capacity next year? I think the numbers that maybe an I-supply or someone like that saying maybe 160% demand bit growth, 200% supply bit growth. What are your thoughts on that as it stands today?", "Eli Harari", "You know, this market is proving to be quite adaptive in fact to the demand side, and we've seen Samsung just announced two days ago in the quarterly results that they're going to -- they're projecting a 120% megabyte increase for them next year, and that is -- and 140% increase in supply industry wide. We think that the demand next year from the new markets and existing markets will be higher than that and frankly, 120% is for additional supplies from Samsung appears relatively low, I think it would be surprised that low. The adaptive part of the market is as you know, NAND with the 60% price decline over the last year or so has become less profitable substantially so than DRAM. DRAM pricing has been going up, and it is no question that DRAM wafer today generates substantially more growth margin dollars to the DRAM manufacturers that also in NAND Flash particularly if they are behind the technology curve in NAND Flash or have not yet adopted MLC to be profitable in NAND you really have to be in 200 millimeters today and you have to be on leading edge technology with MLC and high volume production. So, I think that the sub corrective nature of this business is if the prices will drop too fast, people will not add new capacity, and that will reduce the price decline.", "In general, and I have said that many times in the past, pricing for NAND in the annual 40% to 45%, maybe 50% price decline very healthy for the creation of new markets and I would say certainly in the 40% range sustainable from the point of view of technology migrations. 60% is not sustainable long-term. You cannot have 60% price reductions every year. Let's say we've had 52% last year, I think this year is more like between 55% and 60%. I think that next year I would not be surprised if the demand supply is better because of reduced supply and increased demand. I am actually modestly optimistic about next year.", "James Covello - Goldman Sachs", "Can I ask -- just one quick follow-up on the reduced supply relative to this year. I mean isn\u2019t Samsung's CapEx plans, that's going to impact the latter part of 2007, but we head into 2007 with some pretty significant excess or at least not anywhere near as tight as we were last year, and I guess the question is what do you make of the fact that this time last year with the new products for the seasonal period we were in a significantly tighter supply demand situation and that kind of carried through the first part of this year that we are right now, and thanks very much.", "Eli Harari", "Yeah. It\u2019s a very complex multi-faceted situation, for example, the adoption rate of MLC by everyone of supply has a lot of bearing on the eventual total supply. You know, some of the new players that were supposed to be, pretty significant attributive to capacity in 2006 and certainly in 2007 are having a lot more difficult time competing this market. You just so, what, last week Saifun announced that Qimonda is backing out of this NROM, and that's because of both the pricing situation that makes it less attracted active for them to enter and the technology difficulties that they would be having very similar to what AGN had two years ago for in essence. So, it\u2019s very, very difficult. I have characterized NAND and particularly NAND MLC as a bullet train, and if you're not operating at the leading edge, if you're not sitting in the -- you know, driving the train up front, you're going to be -- you may make decisions to not invest -- you would think a lot harder before you invest in major new NAND capacity.", "James Covello - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Satya Chillara with Pacific Growth Equities.", "Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities", "Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Judy, this is a question for you in terms of royalty. Can you walk us through how there seems to be some upside, where is this upside coming from, is this mainly from MLC or is this more of a quad royalty uptick that you're having?", "Judy Bruner", "The increase -- I presume you're referring to the increase in royalty revenue from Q3 to our Q4 forecast. Does that right?", "Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities", "No, from Q3 to Q4 and also Q4 to Q3, please. Basically you guided, what, 67, right, and you did $78 million in Q3, and so there is some upside. So I am just trying to understand where the upside is coming from?", "Judy Bruner", "So actually we had guided back in July, I believe, to a decrease in royalty revenue of 10 to $12 million from the first quarter which I believe would have worked out to something like 70 to $72 million in royalties, and we achieved $78 million.", "Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities", "Right.", "Judy Bruner", "So there was something like 6 to $8 million of upside, and you know, let me remind that you when we give this guidance we do not have any precise reporting from our licensees on these numbers, so these are estimates that we're putting together based upon various forecasts data and various public statements that we've heard these licensees say, so I am not going to take you through the specific details, but as you know, the royalty revenue -- the royalty rate is applied to revenue of our licensees, so if our licensees either sell more bits or price differently than we were forecasting, or have a different mix as you referred to of SLC versus MLC, all those factor into the number.", "Eli Harari", "I would like to say, make another point on the royalties which actually is today relatively small factor, but nonetheless, I think is one that is perhaps you guys are not really maybe focused on, and that is that as SD particularly miniSD and microSD \u2013 microSD particularly, as that market grows in volume, you know, SD has -- microSD essentially has not become the (indiscernible) for handsets, and we fully expect volume in microSD cards to take off very, very significantly over the next several years, and we do expect that our co-ownership of the SD, miniSD and microSD card standards through 3C, Toshiba and SanDisk to begin to reflect some increased contribution from royalties that we expect to be collecting from those cards. As I said today it\u2019s still relatively small number, but when you're looking at the kind of projections for handsets that have card slots, that overtime could grow and become a nice contributor.", "Judy Bruner", "Actually I will add on one point to that to the question you asked, Satya. There was a bit of upside in the Q2 royalty revenue on the card side but it primarily came from royalties on chips.", "Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities", "On chips. Okay. On the royalty subject, sounds like Samsung is increasing dramatically from 40% to 75% in Q4. What are your thoughts, and it\u2019s all that royalty will start coming into Q1. Is that right, Judy? The MLC contribution from Samsung?", "Judy Bruner", "As we've said in the past, there is a higher royalty rate that we derive on sales of MLC, NAND versus SLC NAND, and so, yes, that bodes well for 2007, but keep in mind that we've seen a fair amount of variation in the past between the projected MLC mix from our licensees and the actual MLC mix that has occurred.", "Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities", "Okay. Great. One question for Eli. Eli, on the cell phone which is in 2007 with the number of models you're talking about and so on, what are the metrics that make you a little more optimistic the retail versus OEM last two quarters you talked about retail uptick being 15% of the entire mix. Any other metrics you can talk about how are they shaking out at this point for Q3 and Q4?", "Eli Harari", "Yes. Let me give you, Satya, one metric that I saw today that really is really very encouraging, and that is the number -- this is a market that I will get the number. The name of the marketing -- they're projecting the number of cell phones sold in the fourth quarter, this quarter, that music enabled will be 90 million actual handsets that are music enabled, and let me remind you they're enabled through Flash memory. Because if you don't have 5 megabyte minimum, you don't really have music, and the number from next year that they're projecting is that fully 51% of all handsets, that is 550 million handsets will be music enabled, enabled either through embedded Flash which something like the iNAND or the mDOC from M-Systems or through mobile cards, so even this quarter 90 million units compared to, -- 8.7 million iPods sold in the third quarter. This is a 10 X large number, and this is why we're so excited about that. And as far as your question about retail and OEM, it\u2019s still early for retail, but it is growing, and I expect it will become a substantial portion eventually I would say within the next eighteen months or so could well become the dominant part of the sales. It sure feels like I could tell you like the heady days of the digital camera market when that really started moving from just a bundle to very strong retail after-market sales, and I would say that for the fourth quarter we are scrambling -- we're really scrambling to meet the demand particularly for microSD, mostly for backend assembly and test capacity, mostly assembly capacity.", "Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities", "Okay, Great.", "Eli Harari", "So the signs are very positive for -- in that regard for Q4 and for next year.", "Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities", "Great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Paul Coster with J.P. Morgan. ", "Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan", "Yeah, good afternoon. I have a couple of quick questions. Eli, as you look at the downward sloping cost curve for the NAND industry in aggregate, how smooth is it now and if there are going to be any sort of step function reductions, when will they takes place and for what reasons?", "Eli Harari", "Good question, Paul. The industry -- these price reductions that we saw over this past several quarters clearly have been faster than anybody would expect including myself, ourselves, and are beginning to -- I believe are not sustainable as I said before until frankly the next major cost reduction has got to come with the next generation technology, and that technology applied at MLC which we've said is around middle of next year, so to the extent that there is aggressive price reductions in the first half of the year, they will -- it become more difficult to bring the cost down until the next generation comes in. We've said that we are -- we expect to start production of the 56 nanometer in the first quarter next year, but the full positive impact will start showing up until the significantly lower cost hopefully that is we don't know the yield of costs in the third quarter of next year. We think that our cost structure is as good as anybody out there. Samsung has said that they planned to introduce the 51 nanometer technology I think in the second quarter next year. So unless you are operating at that node it\u2019s going to be very difficult for other competitors to drive pricing down from where they are today, but as we know, sometimes prices are not driven by cost but rather by other considerations.", "Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, my second question really relates to the channel fill that's happening at the moment. Sounds like you're going from approximately 200,000 outlets to considerably more over the next year or so. As that channel fills out, what kind of product is going into it?", "Eli Harari", "Maybe Sanjay can comment. Sanjay just came back from India. We have a major effort in new geographies -- go ahead.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Basically our retail sales organization is very much focused on increasing the store fronts globally and yes we are around 200,000 now and over longer term over the next three to four years time frame we expect to increase that dramatically toward our goal of about 400,000 stores or so, and basically through the detailed handheld and through all those stores we plan to sell our full lineup of products, the mobile cards, the imaging cards as well as USB flashlight and the complete line of products.", "Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan", "Can you say anything about the margin of that product lineup? Is it going to align with the corporate average or will it be lower?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "You know, we certainly expect the margin to align with corporate targets that we have for the gross margins even as we expand in other regions. We are very much focused on cost reductions and cost reductions achieved through technology transitions as well as manufacturing efficiencies, so we would expect the overall gross margin alignment to remain similar to what we have experienced in the past.", "Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Daniel Amir with WR Hambrecht.", "Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht", "Thanks a lot and congratulations on a good quarter.", "Eli Harari", "Thank you. ", "Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht", "A couple questions. First of all, can you comment a bit on two things related to handset, first the number of units shipped? You made your comment on past couple of quarters of microSD units, and second can you maybe give your best estimate kind of what the attach rate right now between a phone and a card and where it\u2019s going into in '07?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "In terms of the number of cards shipped into the mobile, about 16 million units cards shipped into the mobile space, and in terms of the attached rate, at this point especially it include both the OEM and the retail, the attach rate I believe is somewhere in the range of about 20%, but you would look at having this attach rate go higher.", "Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht", "This is both bundled and unbundled? ", "Eli Harari", "Yes, bundled and unbundled. The majority is still bundled, and the first question was what format, the majority now is microSD, the second largest format is the Memory Stick Pro Duo for the Sony Erickson, we point out that Sony Erickson is 10% -- our 10% customer in the third quarter.", "Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht", "Okay. Thanks. One other question, can you give a litigation update? You commented that you have some expense related to the ITC hearings, where is that standing, what's kind of the time schedule there?", "Judy Bruner", "We have a scheduled court date in the month of December of this year at the ITC, and this is with regard to the suits that we've brought against STMicro.", "Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht", "And the expense? ", "Judy Bruner", "You know, we haven't given the specific amount of expense. But it will cost some increase in G&A in the fourth quarter, and it\u2019s included within the 30 to 35. I actually talked about the expense increase in order of size, so the biggest increase in expenses in the fourth quarter will come from sales and marketing expenses related to the holiday selling season, next biggest increase will come from 56 nanometer development, and then there will be some increase in expense in G&A primarily related to legal.", "Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht", "Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Gurinder Kalra with Bear Stearns.", "Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns", "My first question on cost reductions, what is the sweet spot for your current cost reduction in terms of 12 inch RAM and the 70 nanometer transition? Is it Q4 or do you think you will see significant cost reduction from Q4 into Q1 also?", "Eli Harari", "You know, we are continue to go ramp Fab 3 at the more or less the linear pace. We expect to reach by the middle of next year I think we said 110,000 wafers a month, and the yields have reached very high level. We're very pleased with the yield, so there is not a lot of upside on the yield side. There is some upside on volume. The volume will increase -- will continue to increase substantially absorbing the fixed costs of those fab.", "Judy Bruner", "Let me just add to that, Gurinder. Keep in mind that we just completed the transition to 70 nanometer in Q3 from a production perspective, and so from a revenue perspective it takes one to two quarters before that production is actually built into products, shipped, and recognized as revenue, so there will be clearly some benefit of the 70 nanometer transition that will be impacting Q4 revenue, and we've taken that into account in the guidance that we gave for the 33% to 35% gross margin.", "Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns", "And my second question in terms of seasonality, is your seasonality changing a bit given that the OEM business now is such a big portion of your revenues, I mean normal seasonality obviously strongest in Q4, second strongest in Q2. Is seasonality changing between how you use Q1, Q2 and Q3 given the OEM proportion of your revenues?", "Judy Bruner", "I would say perhaps it moderates it a little bit. But if you think about, the sale of mobile phones and cards for mobile phones are actually do very well in the holiday selling season as well, so and in fact the handset manufacturers, you know, are very focused on taking delivery of the cards on a bundled basis on adjust-in-time basis as well, so there is definitely for example strong demand that we're seeing now in the fourth quarter for cards for mobile phones.", "Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns", "But the OEM business and the handset business, do you think that could make the seasonality in Q1 less pronounced given the linear effect?", "Judy Bruner", "I think you'll still see very traditional seasonality from the fourth quarter to the first quarter in our business.", "Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns", "Thanks.", "Judy Bruner", "Thank you. If I could ask the next caller to limit their questions to one or two, please.", "Eli Harari", "Let me just -- the source for that number of cellphones, 19 million in Q4, and 550 million next year is strategy related and that is their latest report.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Alex Gauna with UBS.", "Steven Chen \u2013 UBS", "This is Steven Chen calling behalf of Alex. My question is in regards to handsets form factor cards. Just would you give us more color on the competition that you're seeing in that space for OEM bundled products from other branded cards and also what kind much ESP pressures do you see in that space given that you're probably dealing more directly with wireless service providers rather than a retail source? ", "Eli Harari", "As I said before, the dominant phone factor has now become microSD both in terms of handset models that supported but also it is almost a wholesale adoption now of microSD. There is motorola ofcourse started that with the thin phones that were enabled by the microSD, but now, you know, Nokia has basically endorsed it wholeheartedly. There is not a single handset guide that is not -- just about any handset guide that has plans for a mobile card slot either goes to microSD or to Sony Erickson equivalent which is M2, MMC -- Memory Stick Duo micro which we're developing together with Sony. The clear, if your SD is basically falling out, MMC is falling out, MMC micro is falling out, compared to 49% for microSD, MMC micro is 1% of the new handsets. It is just -- now, as far as the new players, you know, we've standardized microSD through the SD association, and we do see other suppliers coming into the market. We expect to see competition that's the name of the game, but frankly at this stage, with the very rapid growth I believe everybody is scrambling to go on if you will the back end assembly capacity that's out there. We saw it coming a lot earlier and we are in better shape I think that most other people, but we, too, are scrambling. ", "Eli Harari", "The second piece of your question relative to pricing, the price movement within our OEM channel was very similar to the price movement within the retail channel in this quarter. And typically over time that's going to be the case. You're not going to have big divergence of price movement between those two channels over time. ", " Steven Chen \u2013 UBS", "Okay. And lastly, when would you expect to see some royalty revenues that is derived from your microSD from TransFlash?", "Eli Harari", "We're seeing that as I said, but the numbers are still relatively small, and of course these are royalty says that are shared between ourselves and Matsushita and Toshiba.", " Steven Chen \u2013 UBS", "And last question I have this for Judy, Judy could you provide us your CapEx spending for Q3 and if you could also an estimate for Q4? ", "Judy Bruner", "Okay, so you can actually see the CapEx spending for Q3 on the cash flow statement that's attached to our press release, and you can see it was about $34 million of non-fab related CapEx spending for the third quarter. Are you asking about fab or non-fab? ", " Steven Chen \u2013 UBS", "For everything.", "Judy Bruner", "Okay. For the third quarter is about 34 million for non-fab and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we made very little in the way of fab cash investment in the third quarter. We invested 4 million in Flash alliance for fab 4. Dialing forward to the fourth quarter, on the fab side we expect about $200 million of investment in fab 3, but we expected to come primarily from guarantee of operating leases as I have said a couple of times in the past, as long as we can get attractive operating leases at very low rates, we are prioritizing that type of funding for the fab. And then in terms of non-fab related CapEx I would expect at the beginning of the year I gave a forecast of about 200 million for the year, and I would say we're at about 125 million so far year-to-date and I think Q4 we'll see higher CapEx spending than we did in Q3. I think we will begin to -- we may not reach the 200 million, but we'll get a good way towards that number in the fourth quarter. ", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Christian Garo (ph) with Robert Baird. ", "Christian Garo - Robert Baird", "Your long-term model for captive, non-captive mix is 70/30%. Given that your guidance for the non-captive mix to be less than 10% of -- less than 10% in Q4 which is seasonally the strongest quarter, what could we expect in the first half of next year and specifically could we run of risk of you getting to a 100% captive model and then potentially some other capacity, and I guess the leading question to that is how long are the supply contracts and system has to abide to? ", " Eli Harari ", "M-System.", "Judy Bruner", "You know, let me start. First, let me say we still believe over the long-term the right strategic model for our business is a 70/30 mix, 70% captive, 30% non-captive, and it is too early at this point for us to give any specific guidance for 2007 or the first half of 2007, but as you described, we will have the M-systems business combining with our business fairly soon now, so I think that significantly decreases the type of risk you were suggesting from over supply. Of course M-systems has some clearly has some commitments to current suppliers, and that will put some limitation on our ability to utilize our growing non-captive supply in that business, but we fully intend to work to be able to utilize some of our captive supply within the M-systems business as fast as we can. That's one of the key synergies that we expect to gain out of this transaction over the coming quarters. That's part of what we expect will lead to the deal being accretive by the end of year one as well as revenue synergies that we expect to gain. ", "Christian Garo - Robert Baird", "Great. ", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Craig Ellis with Citigroup. ", "Craig Ellis - Citigroup", "Thank you. Just starting with a clarification. You mentioned competitive pricing. Could you just provide some context around when in the quarter you started to see things being more competitive than you thought they would be when you gave your initial guidance and was that in a particular product line or particular geography? ", "Eli Harari", "I think my saying was fairly competitive throughout the course of the quarter. So these promotion that we implemented to really match and maintain our position was pretty much throughout the course of the quarter. ", "Craig Ellis - Citigroup", "Okay.", "Judy Bruner ", "When you ask that, as we saw the quarter unfold, demand was in line with our expectations if not somewhat stronger than our expectations in the summer months. It really was -- there was a bigger gap than we like to see between our pricing and the competitive pricing and so that's what caused us to make a move to implement higher pricing actions primarily in the form of promotions than we had anticipated when we gave guidance in July. ", "Craig Ellis - Citigroup", "That was across all products, all retail products, Judy. ", "Judy Bruner", "For the most part, yes.", "Craig Ellis - Citigroup", "Okay. And then prospectively, you recently had the announcement with Best Buy and Circuit  City,  how should we think about MP3 market share as we look towards the fourth quarter into next year and how we think about the potential for other similar such agreements that broaden out your partnership profile on the MP3 side of the business? ", "Eli Harari", "I will say New York when we launched supported Best Buy and launching that program. They're very, very serious about the digital music store. We've been working roughly to optimize the something 200 to be seamless. The fourth quarter we're going to have a number of models that span entire price range and we are launching pretty aggressively MP3 players in Europe and the Pac Rim. So fourth quarter we're looking as you know the MP3 market is very, very much centered on the fourth quarter and we are pretty optimistic. We expect to do well, certainly looks very good. ", "Operator", "And due to time constraints, we have time for one final question. It comes from Eric Gomberg with Thomas Weisel Partners. ", "Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Great. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could update us on technology developments where you stand in the migration to smaller geometries and higher capacities in the one-time programmable as well as where things might be in 3 bit per cell or X 4 or making 3D rewritable. ", "Eli Harari", "Okay on 3D we are -- we plan to move by about a middle of next year I would say third quarter next year in production to the next technology node which is still lagging going from .13 micron to 80-nanometer, but it is a very important step to get their costs down. 3 bit and 4 bit per cell, 4 bit is of course X 4 and emphasis has been working on for the last four years or so will have to see how we can do, what comes support we can throw in to accelerate that, but both the 3 bit and 4 bit although quite challenging, we think overall that we have a good shot at commercializing but it probably will not make substantial impact on our cost structure or output until late 2007 at the earliest.", "Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay.", "Eli Harari", "So I think we really have to close here although we are really having enjoying ourselves, so in closing first of all I would like to congratulate us all for Wall Street hitting the 12,000 mark today. It is really great. I wish and you your family a happy holiday season. Also, I want to say that I will be planning a vacation in January, so I won't be here. I will be in the Southern Hampshire and Sanjay will join Jude to discuss Q4 results. But these are good exciting times for all of us and thank you very much.

Morgan ", " Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners ", "Operator", "Good day, everyone and welcome to today\u2019s first quarter 2007 earnings call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Lori Barker Padon. Please go ahead, Madam. ", "Lori Barker Padon", "Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the financial teleconference for SanDisk Corporation for the first quarter of 2007. I am Lori Barker Padon, SanDisk's senior investor relations director. Joining me is Dr. Eli Harari, Chairman and CEO of SanDisk; Sanjay Mehrotra, President and COO; and Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President of Administration and CFO. ", "The agenda for today\u2019s teleconference is as follows: Eli will start with remarks about SanDisk and trends in our markets; Judy will follow up with our first quarter financial results and future guidance; and we will close then the teleconference with your questions for Eli and Judy. ", "Any non-GAAP financial measures discussed during this call as defined by the SEC in Regulation G will be reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. That reconciliation is now available, along with supplemental schedules on our website at SanDisk.com. After the completion of this call, an audio replay of this conference, a copy of today\u2019s prepared comments and quarterly metrics will be made available on SanDisk's investor relations website at SanDisk.com. ", "During our call today, we will be making forward-looking statements. Any statement that refers to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances is a forward-looking statement, including those related to revenue, pricing, expenses, gross margin, tax rates, inventory, production capacity, technology transitions, joint ventures and future products. ", "Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Certain factors that may cause actual results to differ are detailed under the caption Risk Factors and elsewhere in the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, including our Form 10-K for fiscal 2006. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof. ", "We do not intend to update information contained in this teleconference. ", "Now, I would like to turn our call over to our CEO, Eli Harari. ", "Eli Harari", "Good afternoon, everyone. I will discuss current market conditions and recent product announcements, update you on recent IP developments, provide you some interesting thoughts on the demand/supply situation, and then Judy will provide you our Q1 financial details and the Q2 business outlook with her remarks to follow. ", "The first quarter was a down quarter for SanDisk and for the industry as a whole. Excess supply of NAND MLC, coupled with soft seasonal demand in retail precipitated sharply lower pricing. ", "Our first quarter price reductions in retail, although quite steep, trailed the much sharper price reductions by our competitors and probably caused us a small loss of market share in U.S. retail. Notwithstanding price increases recently announced by our several NAND component suppliers, we continue to see a substantial amount of low-priced inventory of cards and flashdrives from our competitors in the channel. Accordingly, we have taken pricing actions for the second quarter to narrow the pricing gap between us and our competitors. We currently expect price reductions to moderate in the second half of the year, given the projected strong pickup in demand as we head into the holiday sales season. ", "There were a number of bright spots in the quarter. One was the record 27 million mobile units sold; indicative of our continuing penetration into what we believe will be our largest opportunity for flash storage in the coming decade. Another was the high level of design-in activities for our newest products, including iNAND, solid-state drives, and megaSim, as well as increasing adoption of our TrustedFlash security platform. And of course our cross-license agreement with Hynix, which I will discuss a little later. ", "This week Dell announced the immediate availability of the 32-gigabyte solid-state discs supplied by SanDisk for two of their corporate notebook models. Dell has also disclosed their intention to propagate the deployment of solid-state discs in a substantial number of their future notebook platforms. ", "We are seeing strong interest from leading notebook OEMs in our 1.8-inch and 2.5-inch solid state products. We believe that solid state discs must transition from SLC, single-level cell, to MLC NAND to achieve pricing that is attractive to main-street consumers. We anticipate that this transition to MLC NAND will favor SanDisk over our competitors, because solid state discs, unlike flash cards or USB flash drives, impose demanding specifications that are not easily met with NAND multi-level cell. ", "SanDisk knows MLC like no other competitor. SanDisk, together with legacy M-Systems, has deep industry experience and related IP in flash solid state systems. We expect to begin transitioning our solid state disc products to MLC later this year and we anticipate modest revenue in 2007 with acceleration in 2008. ", "In mid-April, Sony and SanDisk announced our agreement to jointly specify, develop, and co-own a new super high-speed flash card format for professional video capture, using the PCI express bus for rapid downloads of large video files to a PC. We believe that this new format, called the SxS, although initially a small niche may over time find other high performance storage applications outside of video. ", "In early April we began shipping the Sansa Connect in partnership with Yahoo! Music. The Connect has been receiving excellent product reviews, and is perceived by pundits as pushing the envelope in WiFi connectivity and music sharing. On the lower end of our MP3 players, we began shipping last week the Sansa Shaker, a really fun and affordable MP3 player designed for kids and families. In the mobile space we began shipping 4-gigabyte micro SD, 4-gigabyte Memory Stick Micro, that\u2019s the M2 cards, and 8-gigabyte iNAND, all industry firsts. ", "I will comment briefly on Hynix, STMicro and Qimonda. In late March we signed a long-term cross-license and supply agreement with Hynix. This agreement avoids protracted, costly litigation and reaffirms the value of our patent portfolio. It is important also because it clears the way for future cooperation between SanDisk and Hynix, for example in the area of x4 technology. ", "With regards to STMicro, the Texas court has provided a 90-day stay in the trial involving patent infringement claims by both companies. The ITC case is awaiting the judge\u2019s ruling, which is scheduled for June. ", "Yesterday, Qimonda and SanDisk announced an agreement to form a joint venture in the fast growing market for multi-chip packages for embedded storage in handsets. Qimonda is one of the leading specialists in low power mobile DRAM which is used extensively in many of these multi-chip packages. Qimonda previously announced that it has de-emphasized its internal Flash NROM development activities. ", "Going forward, Qimonda will use our NAND flash die and controllers in some of their multi-chip packages, while we will correspondingly use Qimonda\u2019s mobile DRAM for some of our MCPs. This will augment our embedded storage products for handset vendors and we expect to ship those first multi-chip packages products from this joint venture in the first half of 2008. ", "I will now discuss our progress with our 56-nanometer technology transition and our NAND supply. ", "In the first quarter of 2007, along with our partner Toshiba, we began ramping up volume production of 56-nanometer NAND MLC at our 300-millimeter fab 3. In the second quarter, we expect to ship 56-nanometer products incorporating 16-gigabit and 8-gigabit chips. Actual 56-nanometer product revenues recognized in the second quarter will be modest. However, they are expected to grow substantially in the third quarter and become the majority of bits shipped in the fourth quarter. ", "Particularly encouraging is the excellent progress we have been making on 56-nanometer yields, which have been improving faster than expected. We anticipate achieving cost per megabyte parity with the mature 70-nanometer NAND MLC technology sometime this quarter, ahead of plan. This important milestone considerably reduces the risks associated with the 56-nanometer technology transition and bodes well for our cost reduction later this year. ", "Wafer capacity at fab 3 is also ramping to a maximum capacity, which we now estimate will reach 150,000 wafers per month before the end of this year. This is higher than the 135,000 wafers per month that we previously projected for fab 3, the increase coming from improved efficiencies at essentially no additional CapEx investment. ", "By year-end, we expect our captive output to be overwhelmingly on 300-millimeter wafers processed on 56-nanometer technology. ", "Looking beyond 56-nanometer technology, our NAND MLC joint development team is targeting production starts of 43-nanometer wafers in the first half of 2008. ", "Fab 4 is on plan for a September ribbon cutting ceremony, and it is expected to start contributing to our sales in the first half of 2008. ", "Given the current excess supply of NAND and NAND production cutbacks announced by some of our component competitors, it is fair to ask why we are not cutting back production from fab 3 or slowing down fab 4. I will address this question: First, we project that our demand drivers in the fourth quarter will likely require the full output from fab 3. Consequently, given the faster-than-expected ramp of our 56-nanometer technology, we will likely procure less non-captive supply than previously expected for 2007. In addition, in 2008, we expect output from fab 4 to augment our supply needs to meet our projected demand. ", "Second, in times of fast growing demand from new markets, capacity can quickly flip from excess to shortage and result in customer allocations. There are a number of potential catalysts for driving demand in 2008, including the impact of the iPhone and other multimedia phones on consumption of 4-gigabyte to 16-gigabyte flash in mobile phones, the adoption of 32-gigabyte to 128-gigabyte solid state disks in notebook PCs, and the continuing proliferation of NAND flash into higher capacity music players, video Players, personal media players and gaming consoles and so on, not to mention external stimulus from events such as the Beijing Summer Olympics and the 2008 U.S. election year. ", "In this changing environment, guaranteed low-cost supply becomes a powerful tool to maximize profits and an important lever in expanding our retail and OEM market share in support of our new products, markets, and geographies. ", "Fab 3 is now achieving exceptionally competitive costs and as long as it is operated at the leading edge of technology and fully utilized, we believe that the return on our investment in Fab 3 will continue to be favorable. ", "The third point, the NAND flash market may soon experience structural changes that could potentially bring about periods of considerable supply shortages over the next two to three years. Specifically, we believe that the drastic price declines for NAND flash in 2006 and 2007 will have the unintended consequence of accelerating the obsolescence of industry-wide 200-millimeter NAND capacity. Currently it is estimated that more than 50% of the world\u2019s supply of NAND flash is manufactured on 200-millimeter fabs. That capacity will not be viable by the end of 2008, except for low chip densities, which are a relatively small part of the market. ", "Replacing this capacity, let alone incrementing it, will require several new 300-millimeter dedicated NAND megafabs. If not on the drawing board today, such a fab will not add to NAND capacity before 2009 at the earliest. ", "Compounding this issue, most of the current 200-millimeter DRAM capacity will also become obsolete by the end of 2009 or sooner, when DRAM has to transition to 78-nanometer and below, where these fabs cannot operate. ", "The combined obsolescence of NAND and DRAM 200-millimeter capacities on such a large scale is unprecedented. This scenario in fact is the exact opposite of what the NAND industry experienced in the last two years, where ample 200-millimeter DRAM capacity was thrown into the NAND supply equation. ", "So I hope that this discussion helps you understand our steadfast resolve to execute our long-term manufacturing strategy. In order to maximize long-term value creation, we believe that the benefits of assured low-cost supply outweigh the pain of short-term imbalances, such as excess inventory that inevitably materialize during industry down-cycles. We are keenly aware of our shareholders\u2019 concerns for the short term; however we believe that we are executing the correct strategy for achieving SanDisk\u2019s long-term strategic goals for market leadership in the growth years ahead. ", "I will now turn the call over to Judy. ", "Judy Bruner", "Thank you, Eli and good afternoon everyone. I\u2019ll begin with comments on our revenue. Our product revenue increased 28% year-over-year, resulting from an increase in megabytes sold of 209%, a decline in ASP per megabyte sold of 62%, and the consolidation of the USB joint venture between former M-Systems and Toshiba. ", "On a sequential basis, our megabytes sold were down 22% and our ASP per megabyte was down 23%, with the ASP decline much more aggressive in the retail channel. For the first quarter, the mix of our product revenue was 49% retail and 51% OEM. I\u2019ll organize the majority of my revenue comments by retail sales and OEM sales. ", "Our retail sales exhibited more seasonality this Q1 as compared to last Q1. Our retail units sold were down 32% sequentially compared to down 19% sequentially in the prior year. This exaggerated Q1 decline may be related to the particularly strong fourth quarter of 2006, in which we experienced 52% sequential unit growth compared to 37% growth in the previous Q4. ", "Compounding the seasonally down unit sales was an aggressive retail pricing environment in which our retail ASP per megabyte was down 35% sequentially and relatively low growth in average capacity from Q4 to Q1. ", "On a year-over-year basis, retail units sold grew 50% and average retail capacity increased 87%, but with ASP per megabyte down 67% year-over-year, our retail revenue was down 8% year-over-year. ", "Looking at our retail sales by end market, we experienced strong year-over-year unit growth in all five of our key end markets, with the strongest year-over-year unit growth in mobile, MP3 and gaming. Our year-over-year unit growth in retail USB flashdrives was equal to our average retail unit growth while unit growth in the digital still camera market was below the blended average but still up 39% year over year. ", "Analyzing our OEM revenue is more complex because of the addition of the former M-Systems business. On a sequential basis our OEM unit sales grew 4% and ASP per megabyte was flat, but our OEM revenue declined 8% sequentially due to a lower average capacity. We are now selling embedded NAND products which are lower average capacity and higher ASP per megabyte than our legacy SanDisk products. ", "With a full quarter of this business in Q1, compared to six weeks in Q4, statistics on average capacity and change in ASP per megabyte are distorted. This is why I am providing more granularity this quarter on our retail versus OEM sales and pricing to help you understand our results. ", "For our legacy SanDisk OEM business from Q4 to Q1, unit sales were approximately flat and ASP per megabyte was down 9%, a much less aggressive price change than in our retail business, but this is largely timing related. On a year-over-year basis, our legacy SanDisk OEM business experienced unit sales growth of 80% and our consolidated OEM business had unit sales growth of 130%. ", "Consolidated OEM average capacity increased 69% year-over-year and ASP per megabyte decreased 54% year-over-year, again influenced by the addition of the embedded business. ", "In total, our OEM revenue was up 109% year-over-year, which included growth in the SanDisk legacy OEM revenue of 25% year-over-year. The strongest OEM growth came from the mobile market in which unit sales grew 117% year-over-year. Compared to last year, OEM revenue also benefited from the addition of the former M-Systems embedded industrial business and the white label USB drive business. ", "While we have significantly de-emphasized the white label USB business, it did still contribute to first quarter revenue, as did the consolidation of the USB joint venture with Toshiba, called TwinSys, which added $53 million to Q1 revenue. ", "Our royalty revenue in the first quarter of $97 million was above our previous forecast, primarily due to the mix of component royalties from our licensees and also stronger card-based royalties. ", "Our Q1 non-GAAP product gross margin of 18.5% was down 14 percentage points sequentially and 10 percentage points year-over-year. ", "Our ASP per megabyte declined faster than our cost per megabyte, especially in the retail channel where the sequential decline in unit sell-through in the first quarter meant that a high percentage of our cost of sales came from product manufactured in 2006. ", "Another factor in our Q1 gross margin was that inventory reserves taken in Q1 as compared to those taken in Q4 had an incremental impact on gross margin of approximately 4.4 percentage points. ", "Our Q1 shipments were made with 5% non-captive memory, reflecting good progress in converting former M-Systems products to captive memory. ", "Non-GAAP operating expenses of $177 million declined $8 million from Q4 and this was after adding in a full quarter of the former M-Systems expenses and $6.5 million of charges for restructuring actions taken in the first quarter. ", "Seasonal and volume-related declines in certain sales and marketing expenses contributed to the sequential reduction in expenses, as did the expense containment actions announced in February which took effect quickly and included a reduction in force, a freeze in salaries and a reduction in executive salaries, as well as other expense cutting measures. ", "Other income of $36 million increased $4.6 million sequentially, primarily due to higher cash balances. Our non-GAAP tax rate of 39.8% in Q1 reflects a forecasted annual non-GAAP rate of 35.2% plus $3.8 million of discrete items that impact Q1 only. Fully diluted shares for Q1 reflect a full quarter of the shares issued for the M-Systems acquisition. ", "Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments increased $217 million to $3.5 billion. First quarter cash-flow from operations was $255 million. Accounts receivable decreased very significantly, reflecting strong collections, reduced Q1 shipments and the accrual of significant reserves for promotions and price protection for inventory in the channel. ", "Inventory, net of reserves, increased $98 million to $594 million. At approximately 90 days of inventory, this is more than we would like to carry, but we do expect to utilize this inventory to expand our international footprint over the course of this year. ", "We invested $44 million in property and equipment, primarily for equipment and building construction at our captive back-end assembly and test factory in Shanghai. We received $25 million of repayment against our note receivable from the 200-millimeter FlashVision venture, the third such repayment since we stopped investing in the 200-millimeter fabs. ", "Fab 3 equipment investments in the first quarter were funded by operating lease draw-downs of $349 million. Our total net operating lease guarantee now stands at approximately $958 million. ", "I\u2019ll now turn to our outlook for the second quarter. Given the typically stronger demand in the latter half of the second quarter, we expect significant sequential growth in both units and megabytes, partially offset by continued decline of the white label USB business. ", "On the pricing front, as Eli described, we have made price reductions in Q2 in order to bring our pricing more in line with our competitors. One other factor which will impact revenue, although not bottom line earnings, is that we have agreed with Toshiba to terminate the TwinSys USB joint venture formerly between M-Systems and Toshiba as of the end of Q1. The consolidation of this joint venture contributed $53 million to our first quarter revenue. ", "Taking into account the expected growth in units and average capacity, lower Q2 prices, the elimination of TwinSys and the decline in white-label USB sales, we expect Q2 product revenue to be in the range of $625 million to $725 million. ", "We are forecasting royalty revenue in the range of $95 million to $100 million for Q2. This reflects an estimated decline in our licensees\u2019 Q1 NAND revenue, offset by new license revenue from our Hynix agreement which is being recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the agreement. ", "We expect NAND royalty revenue to recover in Q3 based on the higher MLC component pricing we are now seeing in the market. For 2007, we currently expect license and royalty revenue of approximately $400 million. ", "Turning to gross margin, we expect price declines to be approximately offset by cost declines leading to a forecasted non-GAAP product gross margin for Q2 of 15% to 20%. ", "For the full year 2007, we continue to believe that the non-GAAP product gross margin will be in the 15% to 25% range that we provided at our February analyst day. We expect Q2 GAAP product gross margin to be lower than non-GAAP by approximately 3 points due to the inclusion of stock compensation and acquisition-related purchase accounting charges. ", "We forecast Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $190 million to $200 million reflecting approximately $15 million of fab 4 R&D start-up costs and some increase in sales and marketing expense associated with Q2 seasonal programs and costs related to expanding our international footprint. ", "Q2 GAAP operating expenses are expected to be higher than non-GAAP by approximately $37 million due to stock compensation and amortization of acquisition related intangible assets. ", "Other income for Q2 is expected to be between $30 million and $32 million, as cash is forecasted to come down due to fab investments and lower collections in Q2. The minority interest on our P&L will be zero with the termination of the TwinSys joint venture, and diluted shares for Q2 are expected to be approximately flat, with share repurchases, which began during Q1, offsetting estimated new issuances. ", "On the balance sheet, we forecast that inventory will increase in Q2. We expect this inventory to be absorbed by growth in demand in the second half of the year, including expanded distribution in various international geographies. ", "We expect to make cash investments in fab 3 equipment in Q2 of approximately $275 million. ", "While our outlook for this year remains consistent with the model we presented at our February Analyst Day, we are clearly not satisfied and across the company, we are focused on driving innovation, market share gains, cost reduction and investment in the areas strategic to our future. ", "The NAND supply/demand balance remains an issue for the industry and SanDisk. However, we are optimistic that balance will return in the fourth quarter of this year and beyond as the growth of new and existing markets is fueled by lower price points, and as supply growth is challenged by the future requirement for 300-millimeter fab capacity, which Eli described. ", "When NAND supply/demand balance returns, we expect an extended period of much more modest price declines, translating into a more robust financial model in 2008 and beyond. ", "We will now open the call for your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) ", "We will take our first question from Jim Covello of Goldman Sachs. ", "Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs", "Good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. A few questions. I guess first, could you help us understand maybe a little more of the detail around the Hynix announcement? I know you talked about what the full-year royalty revenues would be but I think there is a fair amount of confusion in the marketplace about what exactly the technologies that Hynix agreed to pay licenses on. If you could give us some kind of color of the royalty rates, vis-\u00e0-vis what some of the other licensees might be paying, that would be great. ", "Eli Harari", "As you know, these agreements are all confidential. All we can say is that it is a long-term agreement the involves a cross-license for a NAND component, including SLC and MLC, as well as a supply agreement to SanDisk -- that is, Hynix will supply SanDisk at preferential terms. We have also said that we will work together on putting together a joint venture entity that will develop jointly, focused very much on x4, four bits per cell development and manufacturing for the two companies. ", "Other than that, we really cannot disclose anything else. ", "Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs", "But it definitely does include SLC and MLC? ", "Eli Harari", "Yes. ", "Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Another issue I just wanted to touch on, relative to -- ", "Eli Harari", "Let me just -- I\u2019m sorry, you know, the market is gone, is essentially now MLC, almost entirely, so any license that excludes MLC would not be very attractive to anybody. ", "Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs", "Sure. I think there was some speculation in the marketplace after the original announcement that it was only by four, but thanks for helping to clarify that. A question I guess on the potential supply tightness in the second-half of the year. There have been some that have speculated that some of the NAND capacity that got moved over to DRAM is going to come back into the NAND market before the second-half of the year, preventing supply from getting tight. I wondered if you had a view on that. ", "Eli Harari", "You have heard the comments from our Korean suppliers who are the main drivers of capacity, as well as of course Toshiba and SanDisk. We are very focused on, and I just gave you what our plan for capacity increases in fab 3 as well as adding more megabytes through the 56-nanometer. ", "I think that the pricing that we saw in first quarter very, very much in my opinion was a consequence of pricing MLC. Basically, a lot of MLC came to the market in fourth quarter from companies that were trying to move from SLC to MLC for quite some time and finally made it happen in the fourth quarter. The market was unable to absorb that MLC, in my opinion, either because of performance issues or because of controllers not being able to handle it. ", "As a result, MLC was priced at -- you know, if you look at the Gardner and other, you know, this is all public information. MLC went from being priced about 10% below SLC to being priced at half of SLC, and that created the whole market for SLC as well as MLC because most of the sales were in MLC. ", "What you have seen recently is corrections, significant corrections from some of these suppliers to bring the price of MLC much closer to that of SLC, within about 10%. We think that that is very healthy for the industry. Of course, it is very good for us from the point of view of royalties on MLC that were being depressed when the MLC price went down by a half. It has now gone up very close to SLC. SLC I believe -- SLC and MLC are priced approximately correctly, in my opinion, relative to the cost structure that we see. ", "For us, we have always said a vast majority of our output is MLC, probably 98%, 99%, and therefore we have just a single price, and of course we do not sell a component, we sell an end product. ", "So it is not only in the -- so I think that what -- we are very focused on demand/supply in balance but frankly, the good news here is that we think the pricing for MLC in the industry has been corrected and the only problem that we have now is that there was some damage done. There was a lot of inventory that was sold in the market at very low prices of MLC. Until that inventory clears the channels, we still -- that is the price in the market for cards and flash drives. Once that is flushed out, I think that we will see a much more moderate pricing environment. ", "Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs", "Terrific. One more last one and then I promise I will go away; just in terms of the non-captive supply. Judy, I think you said it was only 5% this quarter? ", "Judy Bruner", "Correct. ", "Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs", "And then you would expect it to remain roughly at that low level in the next couple of quarters? I am just trying to gauge the impact of the higher margin captive supply on the model going forward. ", "Judy Bruner", "Currently we expect the non-captive to remain at low levels. ", "Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs", "Terrific. Thanks so much. ", "Lori Barker Padon", "Next question. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Craig Ellis of Citigroup. ", "Craig Ellis - Citigroup", "Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Cycling back on the inventory issue, just to understand how that dynamic is playing out, are you saying that in retail or at OEM that inventories have peaked and they are starting to work down, or are they still building a bit? How is that playing out in both sides of your business? ", "Judy Bruner", "Craig, I would tell you that channel inventory is at a very comfortable level. We ended the first quarter with channel inventory of about nine weeks, which is measured based on backward-looking sell-through, so that is a good level. In fact, it is a little less in terms of weeks than we had at the end of Q1 of last year. So where the inventory is a little heavier than we would like is the inventory on our balance sheet. ", "Craig Ellis - Citigroup", "Okay, and then just understanding the pricing dynamic that is related to that, are you talking about pricing in the second quarter that looks like last year and the prior year in the second quarter? Or are you talking about something that would be much greater than seasonal? ", "Judy Bruner", "Well, we have not given a specific guidance on a pricing range for the second quarter but we would be hopeful that the pricing is less in Q2 than it was in the first quarter in the retail environment, but we have moved a number of prices lower in all geographies this quarter, as Eli said, to try to close the gap with our competitors in retail. ", "Eli Harari", "Craig, basically what we said is that price reductions that were projected for 2007 over the whole year are back-end loaded. The first-half of the year is taking the brunt of that and we think that once that takes place, it will slow down very significantly because frankly, the pay level will be very, very difficult for all the suppliers, even the best local supplier. ", "Craig Ellis - Citigroup", "Is it just broad elasticity off of that that\u2019s giving you the confidence to raise your output for the year for fab 3, or is it a particular product program that you see, whether it be the MP3 products or cards or something else? ", "Eli Harari", "As you know, if you look at the last six years, we have a very clear trend heading into the fourth quarter, and we have given some guidance for the year of our expected growth in terms of megabytes, so we do -- we are very enthusiastic and very optimistic about the demand for our output in the fourth quarter. ", "Craig Ellis - Citigroup", "Lastly, if I may, Judy, this is the first time I have heard you call out a card contribution on the royalty line. Can you give us some sense of some of the relative contribution that cards your new royalty has and the traditional royalty payer as we exit the year, and maybe something about how those different levers can grow over time? ", "Judy Bruner", "The increase in the card-based royalty that I referred to was a portion, explained a portion of the increase in royalty revenue that we had over the guidance that we had previously given. The majority of our royalty revenue still remains based upon the sale of NAND flash components. ", "In terms of the new royalty payer, as I mentioned, this is actually license revenue that is impacting us today, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the agreement. As I said, the increase from that license revenue approximately offsets the decrease that we expect to receive this quarter based on component-based royalties, which as you can estimate, would come down given the very significant price decline in Q1 in the NAND component pricing, which impacts our royalties in Q2. ", "Clearly for confidentiality reasons, I cannot give you any specifics, but hopefully those comments help you try to estimate some of these numbers. ", "Eli Harari", "But let me add on the card license, this is not from any specific one license fee. Most of the increase in card license revenue comes from the success of SD, and most importantly micro-SD, SD, mini-SD, micro-SD are now growing at a very fast pace. We, together with Matsushita and Toshiba, collect a royalty on every one of these cards that are sold, so our share of that has grown. ", "Operator", "Anything further, Mr. Ellis? ", "Craig Ellis - Citigroup", "That\u2019s it. Thank you for taking the questions. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Next we will here from Amit Kapur of Piper Jaffray. ", "Amit Kapur - Piper Jaffray", "Thank you very much. I was wondering if you could update us on the expansion of your international retail distribution points and maybe talk about some of the key geographies that you are targeting. ", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "In terms of expansion on the international, we are very much focused on expanding the distribution network as well as having more feet on the ground in Europe and Asia. In that regard, after the M-Systems acquisition, as part of our integration we have really leveraged the M-Systems team to help us manage and grow our retail sales footprint in Europe and Asia. We have just put all that in place in the first quarter. We are making good progress there and we would expect increased share gains and increasing retail storefront presence in Europe and Asia in the future. ", "Amit Kapur - Piper Jaffray", "Maybe turning to the mobile handset market, when you talk with the handset OEMs, how do you see the mobile market playing out? Do you think it is still primarily a memory card opportunity, or are you starting to see embedded flash ramp pretty aggressively in devices? ", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Actually, we are seeing embedded flash ramp nicely but the largest part of portion we believe in the future remains on the card side. But as you know, on the embedded side, we have strong solutions with iNAND as well as the acquisition of M-Systems, NDog, and continuing to have high-capacity products. Now, with this week\u2019s announcement of Qimonda, our ability to improve our offerings on the MCP side we believe will give us a very good leading position on the embedded as well as card solutions. And you see a good mix of opportunities on both sides. ", "Amit Kapur - Piper Jaffray", "Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Daniel Amir from WR Hambrecht. ", "Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht+Co", "Thanks a lot, a couple of questions here. First of all, it seems like the demand supply environment in the second-half of the year, maybe into early \u201908 is impacted by probably two major market, the solid state drive market and the video market as well. Can you comment a bit about how SanDisk views the market, how you think that plays out for you guys here in the next 12 to 18 months? ", "Eli Harari", "We think that the second-half of this year as well as the next year is still mostly driven by the handset market. That is the biggest opportunity. We have said in fact the first quarter was the first quarter that mobile revenues exceeded card revenues for digital cameras, which is a very significant milestone and we expect that to grow. ", "The biggest opportunity is -- catalyst are much more like iPhone than solid state disks. Not to take anything away from solid state disks, but as I have indicated we see that as really a 2008 significant contributor. In the second-half of this year, it is still going to be iPhone, iPhone like devices from their competitors that required 4- and 8-gigabytes of storage, as well as audio players, MP3 players that go through this stage -- and video will be there but relatively still small because the content for video is not yet what -- the infrastructure for video delivery in small devices and handset devices is still going to take some time. ", "But we do see, once you get -- even on the card side once you get cameras that can take the HDSD -- that is the SD cards with the 4-gigabyte and higher capacity, which is basically the entire market is moving to that, then we are going to see the card business also move past this 2-gigabyte capacity and go to 4- and 8-gigabyte. ", "So it is a very broad spectrum of markets and applications, not any one of those, but definitely the handset market is where we see our very strong position, both on the OEM and on the retail, both on the embedded and the removable. In the future, also the MegaSIM. ", "Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht+Co", "The second question is in your comments you prepared that you are planning to do some retail price cuts here, or you started doing them as well. Is the strategy here basically to come back and gain market share after losing market share in Q1? If that is the strategy, should we see that going into the second-half of the year, the company is largely more focused on market share rather than necessarily maintaining a certain gross margin level? ", "Eli Harari", "Market share is very important to us and to a large extent -- frankly, in this particular case, we are not driving pricing in the market. We are really following the consequences of these very steep 50% price declines that were not initiated by us. Frankly, we were trying to hold back and we got [pegged] for that and we are not happy with that. ", "We are always trying to balance market share with profitability, maximizing profitability. At the end of the day it is all about profitability, but 2007 is a tough year. There is no denying that. We believe we do have today the best cost structure out there, that we do have the ability to go and take market share and yes, we will do so. ", "Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht+Co", "Final question is where do we stand on the x4 development now falling Hynix agreement? When should we expect production and what applications are you focusing it on? ", "Eli Harari", "x4 has been under development by legacy M-System for the last more than five years. I cannot get into details of how it is being developed but there has been ongoing development that we believe is on technology that is not leading edge, and basically we are -- it is very similar to what we have done frankly with the 3D technology that was running on, you know, two generations behind and we are moving them as quickly as possible to leading edge. We are doing the same thing with x4. That means that the initial expectations for product maybe later this year will not happen, simply because even with x4 with four bits per cell on an older generation technology competing with two bits per cell on the generation that we expect to be in volume production in the second-half of this year will just not be competitive. ", "So this is really I would say probably the second-half of 2008 type of product introduction for x4 on a much more leading edge technology. ", "Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht+Co", "Thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "Moving on, we will here from Satya Chillara of Pacific Growth Equities. ", "Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities", "Good afternoon. Eli, this question is for you regarding the Hynix agreement. I wanted to dig a little more, see if you can answer any of them. How long is this agreement for? Hynix did NAND production of $5 billion so far cumulative revenues. Did you guys receive any catch-up payments? Lastly, if you can talk about is it at least similar to what you are getting from your other licensee? That would be appreciated. ", "Eli Harari", "Of course, we cannot discuss that, as you well expect. I think Hynix will be very upset and everybody else that is listening there, our competitors would also be wanting to know -- anyway, I can\u2019t comment. ", "Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities", "On all three questions, or -- on the agreement, how long is the agreement? At least can you talk about that? ", "Judy Bruner", "Even the length of the agreement is confidential. ", "Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities", "Okay, got it. ", "Eli Harari", "But it is a long-term agreement. ", "Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities", "Okay, understood. So in terms of, Judy, your guidance seems to be pretty soft compared to what Eli was calling on the TV today, 625 to 725 product. Can you give us the assumptions, what you are thinking here in terms of bit growth and pricing? ", "Judy Bruner", "What I can tell you is that it does reflect significant growth in units and bits in our ongoing business, but remember that that is partially offset by the continued decline of the white label USB business, as well as the elimination of the consolidation of Twinsys, and I pointed out that Twinsys added $53 million of revenue in the first quarter. ", "So there definitely is what we believe is good growth in units and bits, offset by the two items I just mentioned, and also offset by the pricing decline in the second quarter. ", "Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities", "Lastly, Eli for you on x3, three bits per cell. How long have you been working on this program and what is the confidence level at this point going into -- before you start the production, do you feel pretty comfortable on x3? What is the timeframe we are talking about here? ", "Eli Harari", "x3, as I said on February 26th, is going to be very important technology. Our target there is to introduce x3 with no compromise in performance, whereas x4 is much more limited in scope of applicability. We think that x3 has got to be basically just a lower cost version of x2 or MLC. ", "We are making good progress on that. There are some joint development activities that are going on and we are on plan to introduce the first product. I am not sure that we -- okay, so we said beginning of 2008, so I think that is -- let\u2019s put it like this; in early 2008 is when we hope to introduce the first x3 product. ", "Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities", "Okay, but how long are you putting the R&D? Can you answer that, please? How long have you been working on this? ", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "For over -- between one to two years. ", "Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities", "Great. Thank you. ", "Eli Harari", "Let me say that everything that you need to know in x3 you need to develop first in x2. You need to have very fast x2 in order to be able to deliver a cost-effective but high-performance x3, so you could say that we have been developing the foundation for x3 for probably over the last 10 years. ", "Lori Barker Padon", "Thank you. We have time for two more callers. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Sam Doctor of J.P. Morgan. ", "Sameer Doctor - J.P. Morgan", "Thank you. I have a couple of questions. First of all, on the OEM pricing, how should we see that in the second quarter? Is there some kind of a catch-up on the ASP declines in the second quarter, given that your first quarter declines were lower than you expected? ", "Judy Bruner", "You know, let me say a couple of things on the pricing front. We are not going to provide specific price guidance, in part because this is competitive data in the marketplace. But over time, the net price of our products between retail and OEM are not that different in terms of the net price but there can be pretty significant timing differences from quarter to quarter in the different products. So we have taken into account the overall blended price decline in our revenue guidance for next quarter. ", "Sameer Doctor - J.P. Morgan", "When you are talking about low-capacity NAND for Vista or Robson PCs or hybrid hard disks, is a 200-millimeter fab competitive for those kinds of applications? That would be mostly -- ", "Eli Harari", "When I say low-capacity, I mean more 1-gigabit, 2-gigabits type of chips that are used in multi-chip packages. Vista, Robson and these guys are going to go to a gigabyte and that takes an 8-gigabit -- it is very difficult to compete against an 8-gigabit chip with four 2-gigabit chips. It is impossible to compete with a 16-gigabit chip -- against a 16-gigabit chip cost structure with four 4-gigabit chips, even if you are running them on a totally depreciated fab. ", "Sameer Doctor - J.P. Morgan", "But for hybrid hard disks that have seen mostly you have 256-megabyte and 512-megabyte as the standard right now. ", "Eli Harari", "Right, and if you calculate, even if they are very successful, if you calculate the amount of flash it is actually not very large. These fabs, these mega fabs really require applications that are driving 4-, 8-, and 16-gigabytes type of applications. This is really what we are very, very focused on. ", "Sameer Doctor - J.P. Morgan", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We will take our final question from Eric Gomberg from Thomas Weisel Partners. ", "Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Thanks. A couple of questions. One, I was just wondering on the receivables, that is as low as I have ever seen relative to the revenue. Just wondering if you could just briefly comment on what is going on there. Do OEMs pay slower? ", "Judy Bruner", "Sure, Eric. So there are some anomalies this quarter in terms of the receivables and it partly has to do with the fact that, as you know, we recognize our revenue for the retail business based upon sell-through, so there can be anomalies when, for example, we had high shipments and thus receivables at the end of Q4 and that gets collected in Q1. But we are recognizing revenue in Q1 based upon sell-through and accruing price protection and promotions for that sell-through, which can often be inventory that was sold and already collected from the customers. ", "So you should not look at the DSO as being a meaningful statistic this quarter. ", "Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay, fair enough. A question on Hynix, realizing you are very limited in what you can say. You said royalty is straight-lined over the life of the agreement. I am just wondering; as far as x4 or any development there, is that included in the payments? Or, should that be developed successfully, is that potentially incremental? ", "And then just wondering if you could talk about expectations on additional licensees, royalties from others or renewals over the course of \u201907. ", "Eli Harari", "x4 is separate from the current cross-license agreement and the supply agreement. It is a separate -- it is an MOU, memorandum of understanding that we have with Hynix to explore joint development and manufacturing joint venture for x4. So this is actually a work in process but it is not -- no, it does not -- it is not part of a payment that we are receiving for the cross-license. It is something that is going to stand on its own two feet and is a good business proposition for both Hynix and SanDisk. ", "Your second question? ", "Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners", "That\u2019s very helpful; expectations on additional royalties or renewals from others over the course of \u201907. ", "Eli Harari", "Well, on the NAND side, on the NAND supply side, we have today by our estimate somewhere between 90% and 95% of the NAND supply is licensed. Really, other than Micron, there is no other major supplier out there. ", "I had indicated on February 26th that we will be more aggressive on enforcing our IP on the system side, system and card side and we see there is an upside over there, but on the NAND side it is pretty well covered with the exception that I said. ", "Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Fair enough, and just one last question; is it fair to assume that the white label, which is trending lower and the Twinsys is lower than corporate average gross margin, and also just in terms of thinking about cost structure with 300-millimeter fab 3 ramping as well as it is, would we expect that internal costs are declining at a faster pace in the second-half than in the first-half? ", "Judy Bruner", "In terms of gross margin, I would say yes, the white label business has a lower gross margin than the corporate average. But that is different than Twinsys. Twinsys, I think you should think about that, as that comes out, it is neutral to the bottom line because remember revenue, gross margin comes out but also this minority interest, which is negative currently to the bottom line. That comes out as well. ", "I\u2019m sorry, your second question? ", "Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners", "It was just that given the trajectory of the ramp on 300-millimeter and with the 8- and 16-gig monolithic at 56-nanometer, should we assume that internal costs are accelerating, that cost declines are accelerating in the back-half of the year versus what you are experiencing in the first-half? ", "Judy Bruner", "Yes, the second-half of the year will definitely have more benefit from the 56-nanometer ramp than does the first-half of the year. Remember, as you know there is always a lag based upon the fact that we recognize a significant portion of our revenue based on sell-through, which can often be one to two quarters after we ship it. ", "Eric Gomberg - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot. ", "Eli Harari", "Thanks, Eric. I think it is time to wrap it up. I really want to thank everyone here for listening today. We are definitely in a challenging year, 2007 we have said it will be a challenging year, first and second quarter, but we are very enthusiastic and quite optimistic about improving conditions later on in the year. We are very focused on getting our costs and our innovation engine totally focused on end of this year and 2008.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I'd now like to turn the call over to Ms. Lori Barker Padon. Please go ahead. ", "Lori Barker Padon", "Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the financial teleconference for SanDisk Corporation for the second quarter of 2007. I\u2019m Lori Barker Padon, SanDisk's senior director of investor relations. Joining me is Dr. Eli Harari, Chairman and CEO of SanDisk; Sanjay Mehrotra, President and COO; and Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President of Administration and CFO. ", "The agenda for today\u2019s teleconference is as follows: Eli will start with an update on the industry and SanDisk\u2019s overall strategy. Sanjay will follow with operational and business updates, and Judy will end with our second quarter financial results and future guidance. We will conclude the teleconference with your questions for Eli, Sanjay, and Judy. ", "Any non-GAAP financial measures discussed during this call as defined by the SEC in Regulation G will be reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. That reconciliation is now available, along with supplemental schedules on our website at SanDisk.com. ", "After the completion of this call, an audio replay of this conference, a copy of today\u2019s prepared comments and quarterly metrics will be made available on SanDisk's investor relations website at SanDisk.com. ", "During our call today, we will be making forward-looking statements. Any statement that refers to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances is a forward-looking statement, including those related to revenue, pricing, sales, expenses, gross margin, megabyte growth, supply, demand, inventory, production capacity, emerging markets, investments and future products and applications. ", "Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Certain factors that may cause actual results to differ are detailed under the caption Risk Factors and in elsewhere in documents we file from time to time with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2006 and our Form 10-Q for Q1 2007. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof. ", "We do not intend to update information contained in this teleconference. ", "Now, I would like to turn our call over to our CEO, Eli Harari. ", "Eli Harari", "Thank you, Lori. This quarter was the first quarter of operations under our new organization structure that integrates the legacy businesses of SanDisk and M-Systems. Managing this more global and diverse organization of business Sanjay, our cofounder, President, and COO is leading day-to-day management of the company and that allows me to focus on strategic issues facing the company and the industry. ", "Therefore Sanjay will be covering the operational and business update in our quarterly call. While I will address the overall strategy in our big picture outlook. ", "Please do not view this as a signal that I plan to retire any time soon. To the contrary these are exciting times for SanDisk and I'm energized by the many strategic opportunities and challenges ahead of us. ", "The second quarter started under very difficult market conditions but improved markedly as the quarter progressed. April and May were characterized by excess supply, but July is coming to balance and during the distinct possibility the demand for high capacity flash products may outstrip industry wide supply in the second half of this year. Investor plays out then the second quarter will turn out to have been the bottom of the current severe down cycle which in turn would signal the beginning of the next industry upturn. If that is the case then all our strategic investments in low cost captive capacity Fab 3 and Fab 4 will prove to be exceptionally well timed. ", "I believe there are two key factors that are driving the fortunes of the flash industry. First is the storage space of product innovations where flash is an enabler for mobile products. For example, the iPhone is the industry\u2019s first product where only two models available are cutting rise by either the 4 gigabyte or an 8 gigabyte iPhone for flash storage, this is remarkable. The iPhone switch innovative feature has the potential to be an industry transforming product in the fastest growing and most competitive mobile market for multimedia handsets. ", "iPhone validates everything we have been saying about flash storage in multimedia handsets and it may have far greater impact on the flash market in 2008 than the launch of the iPod Nano had in 2005. Apple\u2019s own conception of non-flash may become substantial in 2008, but also major competitors are accelerating deployment of high capacity flash in new multimedia handsets to mark a ferocious challenge to the iPhone. ", "We believe that in the next 12 to 18 months we will see the mobile storage requirement in multimedia phones bifurcate into an OEM business if it is driven by high capacity embedded storage such as iNAND in multichip packages or even MegaSIM on the one hand and high capacity cards sold primarily through retail on the other hand with a gradual decline in the OEM bundled low capacity costs. SanDisk is uniquely positioned to gain from this expected shift, as we have built strong sales organizations that we are separately focused on mobile OEM and mobile retail worldwide. ", "The second key factor is rapidly growing global markets in the new consumer economy which is fuelling or surging demand in consumer electronics and mobile markets. The years\u2019 economy used to be the engine of growth for the rest of the world. Today, the world economies are charging ahead across many geographies, with Europe and Pac Rim countries expected to fuel global growth of consumer demand for a foreseeable future. ", "SanDisk will be a benefactor for these global economic trends because we are becoming a trusted global consumer brand, and because we continue to invest aggressively in global distribution of our product and in the global logistic supply chain. In the second quarter we saw a year-to-year doubling in units sold in Europe and we are expanding our field activities to tap the huge potential for us in international markets in the coming year. ", "NAND flash has become one of the most strategic enabling technologies for portable consumer electronics and mobile products. NAND MLC in particular has got affordable storage to the sweet spot of this market. According to Gardner, a market research firm, in 2001 NAND flash was two times more expensive to megabyte than DRAM. In 2007, DRAM is four times more expensive to megabyte than NAND MLC. ", "This is the result of DRAM pricing declining by 5.5 times between 2001 and 2007. While NAND MLC declined by 45. I say that again 45 times, not percent, times. While non-scaling will become more difficult with smaller geometries in the coming years, NAND may indeed pull an increasingly more disruptive threat to hard disk drives used in mobile applications. ", "On the IP front, the ITC case against STMicroelectronics went against us and given ST's announcement about spinning off their NOR and NAND, we decided not to appeal. Both we and STMicro agreed to dismiss our patent infringement cases in Texas, but still have the California cases pending. ", "We also signed a card license with Taiwan based Ritek and we plan to aggressively pursue licensing other card manufacturers. ", "In addition, our SD card licensing program shows continuing growth with the increasing popularity of microSDs. ", "Concerning what the demand/supply situation is in the second half of the year, prices are firming up and there are market signs that the pendulum may have begun to swing back in our direction. The market has now had two full quarters to absorb the industry-wide transition to MLC late last year, which caused abrupt inventory bubble that had to work its way through the channel. This was a one type of crunch that should not repeat itself at the end of this year. ", "With price elasticity in new products driving megabytes to new demand worldwide, we believe the industry would likely be tight in supply of high density MLC components, as we move into the seasonally strong back half of the year. We are fortunate that we control our destiny through our captive supplying of low cost NAND, MLC at Fab 3 this year and Fab 4 in 2008. I am optimistic that our long term strategy for market leadership should translate into improving financial in the second half of 2007 and in 2008. I will now pass it on to Sanjay. ", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Thank you, Eli. SanDisk had a solid second quarter. Even though the overall industry climate remained challenging, we achieved positive results in driving demand and market share for our products. Managing the product supply chain, growing international sales, increasing average product capacities, diversifying product mix, reducing unit costs, and controlling expenses. First, I will highlight the key development in some of our main markets. ", "The digital imaging market experienced surprisingly strong sequential revenue growth, which was particularly enhanced by growth in our international geographies and by sales of our high performance cards, such as Ultra and Extreme. As of May 2007, total unit shipments of digital cell cameras worldwide grew about 25% year-over-year according to the Camera and Imaging Products Association. The strong DSC market, helped drive more than 2.5-folds year-over-year increase in our best sold through the digital imaging market in the second quarter. You may have seen the announcement yesterday of our worldwide marketing campaign with Ducati. We are making a strong branding push emphasizing speed and performance as we step up customers to higher margin products. ", "In the mobile market, we saw strong growth in retail revenue, but results were light in the OEM channel due to aggressive pricing and reduced market demand for certain handset models at one of our customers. ", "Our mDOC revenue was also light in the quarter, with the industry beginning to shift toward more advanced multi-chip packages, MCPs that combined NAND with mobile DRAM. We believe MCPs will represent a growing segment of the embedded mobile storage market, with revenues starting in the first half of 2008. ", "For iNAND we are also engaged in strong designing activity at tier-one mobile OEM accounts for our second generation at densities of 4GB, 8GB and 16GB. In the retail channel, sales were strong with both units and revenue increasing more than 50% sequentially. Further, average retail mobile card capacity grew about 20% sequentially reflecting continued adoption of high capacity cards for mobile applications. The unit demand for high capacity mobile cards was exceptionally strong and we launched the industry\u2019s first high capacity 4-GBMemory Stick Micro M2 cards and the industry\u2019s first 6-GB and 8-GB microSD cards. ", "For the computing market, we launched our 64GB solid state drive for notebook PCs to meet the projected growth in demand for high capacity SSDs. Furthermore, we announced that our SATA 5000 2.5-inch SSD will be used by IBM for data storage within the Blade Center HS21 XM. This is the industry\u2019s first Blade server to feature a solid state storage solution and we are proud to be part of that achievement. ", "While the SSD market is still in its infancy and we don\u2019t expect significant revenues this year, the continued adoption of our SSD products going forward by PC, server and other system solution providers positions us well to be a key player in that market segment. We have made substantial progress toward pursuing our strategy of increasing our market shares outside of our traditionally strong U.S. market. ", "According to GSK, a market research firm, SanDisk\u2019s overall revenue market shares in Europe across all product categories increased by almost 4 percentage points during May compared to March of 2007. Also unit sales of our products doubled year-over-year in both Europe and Asia. I believe that the new dedicated international sales teams we are putting in place will give us greater ability to drive our business in specific regions, and I am optimistic about continued gains in international sales of our products. ", "Solid execution remained the hallmark of our manufacturing operations. Fab 3 continued to ramp with 56 nanometer process technology reaching cost parity with the 70 nanometer technology, early in the second quarter. Given the healthy ramp of the 56 nanometer technology and the excellent yields, we have been able to achieve in Fab 3, we are now more confident that we can meet our demand even in the seasonally strong fourth quarter with minimal reliance on non-captive supply. Fab 4 is on schedule with initial production planned for the end of the year and ramping up during 2008. ", "In summary, the new organizational structure and the market expansion initiative that we discussed at last February\u2019s analysts meeting are already bearing fruit, giving us what we believe to be strong momentum for continued growth. ", "The innovation engine at SanDisk is strong and we are excited about the work we are doing to bring differentiated products to market. We are seeing good progress on unit cost and our strong execution on the 56 nanometer production should manifest itself favorably in our financial results in the second half of 2007. ", "Let me now turn the call over to Judy. ", "Judy Bruner", "Thank you Sanjay and Eli and good afternoon everyone. Our year-over-year increase in product revenue of 13% reflected an increase in megabyte sold of 217%, and a decline in ASP per megabyte sold of 65%, as well as an increase in non-memory product revenue. ", "On a sequential basis, our megabyte sold were up 50% and our ASP per megabyte was down 26%, adjusting for the fact that we are no longer consolidating the TwinSys joint venture, which added 53 million to Q1 and our total product revenue increased sequentially by 13%. Looking at our revenue by channel, we return to our more traditional mix with retail comprising 67% of our revenue. ", "Our retail sales exhibited very strong seasonal recovery with retail revenue up 41% sequentially. Megabyte sold of 74% and ASP per megabyte down 18%. The 18% retail decline in ASP per megabyte compares very favorably to 35% in the first quarter, and the 74% retail megabyte growth compares to 45% in Q2 of last year. ", "We believe the favorable Q2 retail megabyte growth reflects three factors; one, the elasticity benefit of price reductions over the last several quarters, two, the exaggerated seasonal softness in Q1, and three, the growing retail mobile market. We saw very strong sequential retail sales growth in our imaging mobile handset and MP3 products. ", "On a year-over-year basis, our retail revenue grew 9% reflecting robust growth in megabyte sold of 236%, and a steep 68% decline in ASP per megabyte. We saw the strongest year-over-year retail growth in our mobile business followed by growth in MP3 and USB sales. ", "Looking at OEM sales on a sequential basis and removing the effect of TwinSys in Q1, OEM revenue was down 22% with megabyte sold approximately flat to last quarter and ASP per megabyte down 27%. As Sanjay discussed, our mobile OEM revenue was down sequentially due to aggressive price declines coupled with the reduction in unit demand from one of our handset OEM customers, and a decline in mobile embedded sales. ", "On a year-over-year basis, our OEM sales were up 23% with megabyte sold up 166% and ASP per megabyte down 57%. The year-over-year OEM revenue growth primarily reflects the addition of product lines from the M-Systems acquisition such as mobile embedded and industrial embedded products, and non memory products such as SIM cards sold in the mobile network operator channel. ", "While OEM sales were weak this quarter, retail sales were particularly strong and our overall product revenue performance demonstrates the benefit we derive from the diversity of our product lines and customers. ", "License and royalty revenue for the second quarter of $107 million increased 30% year-over-year and 11% sequentially, and reflects the addition of our license agreement with Hynix increased card based royalties and higher than forecasted component based royalties. The component royalty increase is primarily the result of higher royalty rates on one of our licensees Q1 sales resulting from certain sales thresholds. These higher royalty rates will not be repeated in the remaining quarters of the year resulting in annual royalty rates by product lines that are consistent with the past. ", "Our Q2 non-GAAP product gross margin of 19%, improved slightly from 18.5% in Q1, primarily because our costs decreased slightly more than our prices on a per megabyte basis. The amount of inventory related charges in Q2, was similar to Q1 as a percentage of sales and did not contribute to the gross margin improvement. The Q2 inventory charges primarily relate to certain products where our sales forecasts are less than originally anticipated. ", "Our Q2 shipments were made with approximately 95% captive memory consistent with the Q1 captive shipment mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $169 million; $8 million less than in Q1 and significantly below the forecast I had provided of $190 million to $200 million. About half of this difference is due to a shift in certain Fab 4 startup costs from Q2 to Q3. This does not reflect any delay in Fab 4, just the timing of when the expenses will be incurred. ", "The other reasons for lower spending in Q2, included a shift in certain sales and marketing expenses from Q2 to Q3, and better than anticipated savings from our cost containment actions. Other income of $38.5 million included a $4.1 million one-time gain related to the sale of certain equity investments. ", "Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments decreased $267 million to $3.2 billion. We utilized $90 million of cash in operations, primarily due to an increase in product and royalty receivables. Days sales outstanding are at a favorable level of 39 days. Inventory, net of reserves, increased slightly to $601 million remaining above 90 days of inventory. We are comfortable that this inventory will service well to meet the expected demand in the second half of the year, when non-captive supply may be more costly. We provided $123 million in cash to flash partners for Fab 3 equipment in the form of a note receivable, and we received $13 million from Flash Vision in final payback of the Flash Vision note receivable. ", "We also invested $54 million in SanDisk capital equipment, which included assembly and test equipment for our captive factory in China, as well as some captive Fab equipment that we now own at a foundry for our 3G products and processes. The last key use of cash was $55 million for repurchase of our shares. ", "I will now turn to our outlook. ", "Traditionally, megabyte growth in Q3 is less than in Q2 due to slower summer seasonality. And we expect a similar pattern this year. Over the last three years, our Q3 megabyte growth has ranged between 20% and 40% sequentially and we believe this is a reasonable range to expect for this Q3. At the same time the pricing environment is expected to be significantly more favorable for us, than in the first half of the year. ", "We have few planned price reductions in retail for the summer months. However, our ASP per megabyte will still decline due to price reductions implemented in June, which will impact all of Q3. With our OEM customers, some of the expected Q3 business is locked in at prices quoted during Q2, which reflect a sequential quarterly reduction. ", "Our expectations for megabyte growth and pricing, lead us to forecast Q3 product revenue in the range of $750 million to $825 million. ", "Looking at the year, we now expect bid growth for 2007 of 180% to 200% up from our previous forecast of 170% plus. We expect Q3 license and royalty revenue between $105 and $115 million based upon the forecast of sales of our license fees. ", "For 2007, we are raising our forecast of license and royalty revenue from our previous forecast of $400 million to a range of $420 million to $430 million. ", "Turning to gross margins, we expect cost decline to exceed price decline leading to forecasted non-GAAP product gross margin of 20% to 24% in Q3. And we currently anticipate a continued gradual increase in gross margin for Q4 as we benefit from a higher mix of 56 nanometer sales. We expect Q3 GAAP product gross margin to be lower than non-GAAP by approximately 3 percentage points due to the inclusion of stock compensation and acquisition related purchase accounting charges. ", "We forecast Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $205 million to $215 million, reflecting a sequential increase of approximately $20 to $25 million in Fab 4 R&D start-up costs and increased investment in future technologies as well as in sales and marketing programs related to the demand generation and expanding our international footprint. We currently expect non-GAAP operating expenses to increase again in Q4 due to seasonal sales and marketing expenses. Well, Fab 4 start-up costs are forecasted to be at approximately the same level in Q4 as in Q3. ", "Q3 GAAP operating expenses are expected to be higher than non-GAAP by approximately $34 million to $38 million due to stock compensation and acquisition related intangible assets. ", "Other income for Q3 is expected to be about 10 million lower than in Q2 due to the one time investment gains in Q2, anticipated lower cash balances as a result of the fab investment and a shift in our investment portfolio towards more tax exempt securities which yield us a better after tax return. ", "On the balance sheet, we forecast that Q3 inventory levels will likely increase in preparation for Q4, and we expect to make cash investments in Flash Partners and Flash Alliance of approximately $350 million about half of which we had originally expected to fund in Q2. ", "In summary, we are optimistic that the improved supply-demand balance in the NAND market will continue leading to a return to a more normal price declines and a gradual improvement in our margins in the second half for this year. ", "We will now open up the call for your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). And we will take our first question from Daniel Gelbtuch with CIBC. ", "Daniel Gelbtuch - CIBC", "Hey congratulations on a great quarter and great guidance. ", "Eli Harari", "Thanks Daniel. ", "Daniel Gelbtuch - CIBC", "First of all I was wondering if you could give us some color about the Ritek deal and do you think this is going to be a model for additional deals in Asia with regards to many of the ODMs and OEMs or smaller ones out there? ", "Eli Harari", "Yes, we do. We have put together a -- frankly a new license contracts for a third party card reserves, a card including USB flash drive, MP3 players and so on. And well, I think is the first one that in fact have find out for that license in hand. We expect it to be -- we will certainly offer it to a wide range of other potential licensees and hopefully they will sign up. ", "Daniel Gelbtuch - CIBC", "Okay, and then just turning to SSD. Obviously with the pricing going up for a component, I guess not for you guys, but for everyone else in the world, I was wondering where do you think we should see the inflection point for SSD coming? Is it going to be function of how NAND compares in price to magnetic? Is there some trigger point that you think we will see a tipping of -- or a ramp of SSD? ", "Eli Harari", "Well, we set the asset several times that SSD really needs to shift to multilevel sale MLC flash even -- it did basically at any technology node. In order for the SSD to become attractive at 32 gigabyte or 64 gigabyte for the consumer space, it certainly needs to go to the 56 nanometer or 50 nanometer or so, a generation of MLC and this is what we are focused on. In the enterprise space, the service space, the pricing is substantially higher, the requirements are different, although the market there is relatively small -- I mean smaller than the notebook market, it's still a very substantial market and as you know that this type of people make all of their margins -- the majority of their margin enhance price space. So, with the announcement about IBM server design win, we're basically signaling that we are going to be addressing both the consumer SSD market and the server market. ", "Daniel Gelbtuch - CIBC", "Okay. Thank you very much and congratulations. ", "Eli Harari", "I would say -- really as Sanjay said, we expect this to be really marketed to be very design win intensive over the next 12 months and really start generating material revenues in 2008. ", "Daniel Gelbtuch - CIBC", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll take our next question from Amit Kapur with Piper Jaffray. ", "Amit Kapur - Piper Jaffray", "Great, thanks a lot. I was wondering if you could provide your views what kind of -- what types of densities you expect within the mobile handset applications over the next say 12 to 24 months? Most of the phones that we see out there seemed to be capped off with 2 gigabyte memory card support. Do you see any new applications or potential iPhone impact on other OEMs breaking through that barrier soon? ", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We certainly see the average capacities in mobile handsets continuing to increase. If you look at last year to this year, average capacities for retail have doubled in the mobile handset business. We certainly continue to see the same trend forward. By end of the year in retail we would expect the average capacities to be about 2 gigabyte. On the embedded side as well with our iNAND we are seeing strong design wins and these are iNAND design wins of high capacity 4 gigabyte and 8 gigabyte. And on the card side for mobile handsets, the support for high capacity cards is certainly coming through and then in near future we will see, we will begin to ship 8 gigabyte cards as well later on in the years. And we will have the handset support for high capacity microSD and other high capacity cards as well. So all in all, we continue to see strong trend both on the embedded as well as usage of cards for high capacity, in the handset market. ", "Eli Harari", "I would add that in the retail market, on the high capacity, that is 4 and 8 gigabytes, the key issue that is being resolved as we speak has been designing the new handsets to accommodate the high capacity, the SDHC standard and that is helping right now. So moving forward, I think certainly in this quarterly sale season and certainly next year, the aftermarket will move very much to 4 and 8 gigabytes to basically meet the iPhone phone 8 gigabyte capacity points. ", "Amit Kapur - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. Great. Maybe one quick follow-up. Mobile TV seems to be gaining support with some of the wireless carriers out there. But the ability to store content seems kind a limited. What are some of the barriers do you see in mobile video storage and when do you expect those to be resolved? ", "Eli Harari", "The issue there is very much infrastructure to deliver content, both mobile TV as well as movies in reasonable time because of bandwidth allocation. The wireless bandwidth allocations are still very severe. So this is slightly [changing]. But then there is also the protection DRAM schemes for protecting valuable video content, movies and so on. We think that the industry on the TV side is, they need to move very much away from selling you TV episodes for $1.99 or so to add supported three downloads of TV programs. We think that that's a great move for the industry and of course for us, because, this would definitely simplify the whole infrastructure for delivery of this TV program. In terms of downloads, we believe that TV programming will far, far exceed downloading of movies at least for the next 12 months or so. This is a very exciting situation right now, and definitely the entire content providers are looking now very eagerly at how to move in a big way to download content, not just to standalone players, PMP players, video players, and music players, but also to handsets. Handsets is eventually going to be the biggest application for video and in fact iPhone has demonstrated or will be demonstrating, what a great platform, the handset, the multimedia handset could be for video programs. So we are very early, but this is going to be a very-very large market. ", "Amit Kapur - Piper Jaffray", "Great, thanks a lot guys. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to Paul Coster with J.P. Morgan. ", "Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan", "Thank you. Eli you seem quite positive about the outlook for the beginning of next year. This time around we are not going to get that one-time effects of the MLC RAM, but is there anything in the new products that also gives you confidence that you will see kind of overflow of demand, and I'm thinking here will the SSD, which is presumably not a seasonal sale have any impact in the first half of next year, or for that matter the aftermarket sale of cards in these new multimedia handsets? ", "Eli Harari", "Yeah I don't think that SSD can absorb, can make a big difference frankly in Q1, Q2 next year in terms of the demand supply balance, but I do think that the two key factors that will influence the demand supply balance in Q1 will be Vista on the one side which is really been directed through the DRAM market. If Vista finally really drives demand for DRAM that will definitely impact the supply of NAND through non-conversion of DRAM capacity to NAND. ", "And the second one is what we said the market\u2019s reaction to the iPhone that brought in the first quarter next year should start kicking in our first quarter next year, the 3GSM Conference and everybody is seriously working on products that will be very attractive, significantly less expensive than $600 and we\u2019ll definitely use a lot of flash. And this is where we see the biggest possibility for creating a demand supply balance or in fact an imbalance in favor of demand. ", "Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan", "And the second question, Judy the Fab 4 ramp at what point do the start-up cost get rolled into gross margins? And how should we be thinking about the gross margin impact from the event when it happens, timing its etcetera and magnitude? ", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. We currently expect the impact of the Fab 4 start-up cost to begin rolling into cost of sales in the fourth quarter. We expect they will continue to be start-up costs in R&D in the fourth quarter at approximately a similar level to that of the third quarter, but then additional start-up costs beginning to hit cost of sales in the fourth quarter. So that would have some muting affect on their gross margins in the fourth quarter. But as I said we're optimistic in terms of the pricing environment for the second half and the effect that by the fourth quarter of this year we\u2019ll begin to have much more contribution from 56-nanometer in our sales. ", "Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you we're going next to Satya Chillara with Pacific Growth Equities. ", "Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities", "Hi, good afternoon. So Eli at this point are you in a position to talk about cell phone revenues for the year now that it seems you have locked in lot of OEM as well as you\u2019ll see some retail sales. What is the prediction by the end of the year, cell phone would be for SanDisk? ", "Eli Harari", "What do you mean? ", "Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities", "The cell phone revenue as percentage of your total product sales from cell phones.? ", "Eli Harari", "We are not providing this kind of prediction. I could tell you that in terms of unit revenues for Q2, we saw approximately 30 million units combined and we certainly expect the unit count and megabytes\u2019 count to increase in the second half of the year. ", "And as we've indicated this consists of a decline in bundled cost and then increase in retail cost as well as a decline in low capacity units and increase in high capacity units. So it's moving in the right direction flow. But I would expect that this year mobile will be our biggest revenue generated for the year with one for (inaudible) is that as we've said for this second quarter the digital still camera market was significantly strong in retail and if that trend continues and that too will be a very strong market for the rest of the year. ", "Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities", "Okay, Eli, one other question on the licensing side. In terms of STMicro, you've gone with STMicro even though you said you are dropping it right now in terms of appeal, you have lost the case two times and contrast that with Samsung back in 1997. What\u2019s the message I think will be, we are struggling here, why did you loose the STK's at ITC and basically in future, how airtight is your intellectual property? ", "Eli Harari", "We think we have very, very strong intellectual property. We lost the case, frankly the same partner has contested three times at the ITC with three different judges. The outcome in the three cases was in the first case we won on infringement and validity. In the second case, we won on validity but not on infringement. I guess we lost on validity and non-infringement. In the third, we won on infringement and non-validity. So this is the part of the frustration that you have when you are dealing with a patent case. I would say if there was one error that we made, a strategic error is that we tried to go for a very quick resolution and therefore relied on a single patent which we thought was definitely a very strong, a pretty fundamental patent that we create. And if I had to do it all over again I would definitely bring significantly more patents to play in here. ", "When you bring the same patent, what happens is that the other side learns all the arguments and all the counter arguments and that was the mistake that we made. We will learn from that mistake. ", "Satya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities", "Okay, thank you. ", "Eli Harari", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to Gurinder Kalra with Bear Stearns. ", "Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns", "Thanks. Just a couple of question from my end. Now Eli, you talked about the potential of demand exceeding supply in second half of this year. Now, it looks like both Samsung and Hynix are having some yield issues with their current process transition, and it will be resolved at some point in time. How does that influence your supply projections and your potential forecast? ", "Eli Harari", "We are not counting on them to fail. We are counting on them to succeed and they have been very good in the past at delivering whatever the market needs within limits. More importantly is how much big capacity do they allocate between NAND and DRAM in nothing that\u2019s more important than yield issues. I think that they will -- my assumption is that they will all become those yield issues. ", "Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns", "Okay, thanks. Secondly, can you update us on when you plan to go into volume production on three bits per cell x4, and also any progress on the Matrix side? ", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So, on the three bits per cell as we said before, we will have initial product shipments of three bit based technology early in 2008. On the four bits per cell technology, we will have samples in second half of 2008, and the three bit technology we are working on -- and the 3D technology, we are working on transitioning that to the next generation technology note and we are continuing to make good progress there. On the OTP side as well as working on developing the read-write version of that technology which Eli had mentioned is the R&D efforts that will take two to three years to really fully materialize. ", "Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns", "So, on the four bits per cell line, you are talking about samples in the second half of the year or for next year? ", "Eli Harari", "Excuse me. ", "Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns", "So on the XFER you said you are having samples in the second half of next year? ", "Eli Harari", "Yes. ", "Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns", "So that would be a slight delay from your previous statement? ", "Eli Harari", "I feel last time that we had decide to apply XFER on a more advanced, the leading edge foundry node rather on an existing or trailing edge node and that basically means that we scrapped products on the 70 nanometers foundry, which we actually have and are focusing on a more advanced, on really the leading edge foundry in that time frame. ", "Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns", "Okay. Thanks very much. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We will take our next question from Craig Ellis with Citi. ", "Craig Ellis - Citi", "Thanks for taking the question. Just first a question for Eli. Eli, you have talked about the number of supply/demand factors into early next year. How much of your competence in an upturn in NAND is predicated on the challenge that industry will pace as it moves up at 200 millimeter capacity in the first half of next year and the dampening effect that will happen over other group? ", "Eli Harari", "I think as I have said and I think now lot of people are saying, in fact, I think I believe the Koreans are saying the same thing now, that they plan to not drive advanced technology transitions in NAND under 200 millimeters. So that will have an impact on reduced supply under one hand, on the 200 millimeter. On the other hand, they are investing aggressively in 300 millimeter. So I think that, I am looking more frankly at this point to the surging demand we talked about, this global increase in demand that we -- it's a real phenomenon, and the fact that we have such a relatively small market share in many of these geographic markets is their stuffed optimism, that once they are put in place, the kind of resources that we have, we build in the United States that we can do significantly better and that will drive at least for us, we believe continued growth and demand and account for a 100% of assets from our captive supply. ", "Craig Ellis - Citi", "Okay. Thanks for that Eli. And then Judy, just a couple of quick ones. First on royalties. For a couple of quarters we are in the low teens as a percent of revenue. The long-term model is really high single digits at 10%. Is there anything unusual other than the one-time item you mentioned in the second quarter royalty that's going to impact how we think about the longer term model? ", "Judy Bruner", "I'd always say really the only other factor is that we are seeing success in terms of growing our card based royalties. But at this point, I would not change our long-term model. ", "Craig Ellis - Citi", "Okay. And then secondly, I wasn't there on the gross margin commentary in the outlook. It sounded like there was a similar degree of inventory write-down pressure in the second quarter, as you saw in the first quarter. What is assumed in the third quarter guidance with regards to inventory write-down? ", "Judy Bruner", "Well of course it's difficult to predict what inventory write-downs might be in any future quarter. But, we are optimistic that inventory write-downs in the second half will not be at the level they were in the first half. And that could be a factor and in gross margin improvement. But the primary factor that we are looking at is the pricing environment, and then as we get further into the second half, the higher contribution of 565 nanometer product. ", "Craig Ellis - Citi", "Okay. Thanks to everybody and congratulations on the quarter. ", "Eli Harari", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Next we'll go to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. ", "Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs", "Hi guys, good afternoon thanks so much for taking my question. Couple of quick things some of what you alluded a little bit too on the remarks up until now. But I guess first you have the advantage now where you have the capital supply as your competitors your card competitors costs are going higher, how do you strategically think about the decision of increasing market share versus increasing margin? ", "Eli Harari", "I think we should try to maximize our margin of course but keep our output at a 100% utilization. And at this stage it's a little bit academic, it's very difficult to frankly \u2013 the list is like this, non-captive supply today is very, very expensive and were definitely at this stage a bit difficult to justify to bring additional captive capacity overall to gain market share at the crest or close to zero or may be even negative margin, it's not what we would want to do this time. ", "Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs", "And I mean I guess another way to ask it would be with your captive supply that you have, how do you just make the decision between being price aggressive to try to go out to gain share with your captive supply versus just trying to have higher margins because, your supply is cheaper than your competitor's supply? ", "Eli Harari", "Well, first and foremost, we make sure that we address our strategic customers and don't behave opportunistically. On the other hand we as well as the industry, the supply side have really suffered through this price decline and we do think I have said many times that the kind of profit we've seen in the last two years are really unsustainable and that to justify future investments you really needed to get to significantly better gross margins than what we have experienced in the last two quarters. So you can improve your gross margins primarily by holding costs, by bringing cost down faster than your pricing comes down. And in some cases you want to bring your prices up because they were forced upon you to be way too low because of crazy competitive situation. We will definitely try to regain some pricing whatever we can, but not opportunistically not point of abandoning or offsetting low trend on strategic customers. ", "Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs", "Okay that\u2019s helpful and that kind of leads into my second question which is, we are now in a very good position in the industry but in large part because supply got cut so much, our new supply growth got cut so much because of the move to from NAND to DRAM and because of the decrease in NAND orders from some of your competitors to the equipment suppliers. How do we get comfortable with now that pricing is looking better, that everything is not just going to come flying back on line, that your competitors aren\u2019t going to just turn on this, pick it again and that you guys along with Toshiba aren\u2019t just going to increase the CapEx again because that could be what brings all this to a faster halt than we would have hope for? How are you thinking about it and how can you help us to get comfortable with the continued discipline on the supply side? ", "Eli Harari", "It\u2019s a good point, good question and definitely it seems to go south in the future and there will definitely be periods where we have these kind of situations, where industry as you know go through these cycles. But what's working for us is price elasticity, and demand elasticity is very strong right now. It finally caught up with the pricing and its much -- I mean we are talking about 220% increase in megabyte trickling our megabyte shipments year after year, so we have the large number of -- the theory of large number is actually now in our favor and that it's becoming more and more difficult to double the megabytes output because the basic numbers are now becoming very large. It's very difficult for new players to come in and make a dent. So, I think that the industry -- and everybody had suffered frankly through this experience of the last two quarters, but frankly we've had six quarters lost pretty severe quarter-to-quarter ASP declines, and I would say the sixth quarter is the longest down cycle the demand industry has had. And I think that the industry -- all the supplies would like to see this trend kind of turn around and much more moderate first declines, but of course the key to that is to get the demand [throughout our 50], through new products, through existing markets and new markets investment we are working on. ", "Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs", "That\u2019s helpful, thanks. And then my final question and then I\u2019ll go away. In terms about the royalty stream, you've referenced earlier like at the analyst meeting that Samsung, you would continue to negotiate with them as they contract, that\u2019s called the current contract, it gets closer to expiring at the end of 2009 and you had said that that would be a difficult negotiation but you thought it would ultimately be successful. And then -- so, any update there, and then on Micron, Micron seems pretty automate that they're never going to have to pay you guys a license -- a royalty fee and I'm curious as to your opinion about that? Thank you. ", "Eli Harari", "Yes, I repeat what I said, I have no need to repeat this basically what I said about Samsung. We still believe that that would have been the best expense of Samsung and send it to a -- come to an agreement before the expiration of the current agreement. With regards to Micron, nothing has changed as far as our thinking which is of course not the same as their thinking and we will continue to work on that one. ", "Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks very much. Congratulations. ", "Eli Harari", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll take our next question from Daniel Amir with WR Hambrecht. ", "Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht", "Thanks a lot. A couple of questions here. First, what's the percent of production where you have a 56 nanometer by year end? ", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "As we have said before, by end of the year we will have majority of our bit production in terms of output from the fabs in 56 nanometer. And that the 56 nanometer ramp is going extremely well, we feel pretty confident in our ability to meet that previous guidance. ", "Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht", "Okay. And then the question -- a bit about your OEM mobile business as it relates I guess to the mDOC's/the iNAND. Can you a bit think about how does this compare with your previous expectations, I guess before the M-Systems acquisition? And is there a following against the iPhone trend here? I mean is there a change I guess in the mindset which direction it's going here in terms of embedded NAND in handsets. ", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So, embedded NAND on the handset as we said in the prepared statement, really the trend is in two directions. One primary trend is toward multi-chip packages and with our partnership with Qimonda, in the joint venture with Qimonda, we plan to have multi-chip packaged solutions in the first half of next year. Also on the embedded side, we are seeing the trend is moving toward the iNAND type of solution. A high capacity iNAND design wins, and with that we will see increase in our revenues later on in the year because iNAND embedded solutions design wins in terms of production take somewhat longer. By end of the year we will be seeing increases in embedded revenue coming in from the iNAND. So, the mDOC part is really shifting towards multi-chip packages, as well as, toward iNAND design wins. ", "Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht", "And where does the MegaSIM kind of fit into the strategy here? ", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "The MegaSIM also is an attractive semi-removable solution and that is also something that we are offering to the customers and we are seeing increasing design wins in that area as well. ", "Eli Harari", "On the MegaSIM, of course, the target customers for MegaSIM are not the handset manufacturers, but the mobile network operators, because they sell the SIM today. They own that and in their endeavor to increase their ARPUs, they are moving to more services than they could handle. The services could be much richer, if they were able to store a lot of content on the MegaSIM. ", "Daniel Amir - WR Hambrecht", "Okay. Thanks a lot. ", "Eli Harari", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We will go next to Alex Guana with UBS. ", "Steven Chin - UBS", "Thanks. This is Steven Chin calling behalf of Alex. I just had a couple of more questions related to the iNAND and mDOC product lines. So as far as relative positioning going forward, it sounds like iNAND and other MCP type products will have more preference or usage in embedded cell phone application. Just given that, does that mean mDOC sales would begin to decline at a certain point and then you would have a crossover between iNAND sales and mDOC sales? And secondly, for iNAND MCP type products, would you guys typically be a single source for those sockets, or would it be dual source or and more because of the standardized footprints for some of these products? ", "Eli Harari", "So, really you have the point on the second point which is the standardization. So, what that means, in the mobile space for embedded is that there is rule among the main suppliers towards [JDC 64] which in itself is not just one product, but assembly of products that migrates towards eventually a bootable NAND working with a mobile DRAM and that is a direction that we are moving with iNAND and Samsung is moving with moviNAND, Toshiba has the GB NAND and its trying to satisfy the handset manufacturers that perhaps are tired of dealing with very large number of proprietary solutions that are not really the way to go for very high volumes. ", "Lori Barker Padon", "There is time for one more caller please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll take our last question from Bennett Notman with Davenport. ", "Bennett Notman - Davenport", "Thank you for getting me in at the buzzer here. It seems like since you've locked up the bulk of the NAND manufacturing marketplace in terms of the licensing opportunity, you are now diversifying and going into sort of ancillary and related opportunities. And could you just talk a little bit about the potential for licensing outside of the manufacturers and into the other NAND market areas and how you look at that opportunity versus the magnitude of the opportunity you've got with the manufacturers? ", "Eli Harari", "We've said that we think we have most of the NAND manufacturers and NAND, NOC manufacturers covered and we of course have by virtue of SD, many of the microSD being a very large part of the card business. We have that covered through the SD association. We don't have the other card manufacturers and USB flash drive covered in this. This is a target area that we are pursuing through this licensing program. It will be significantly smaller, than the component business, but let's say in the next one to two years; however we've said that eventually we think that most flash memory will be sold as a card or as a system solution as opposed to a component and at that point, we'd like to capture both aspects of the product. ", "Bennett Notman - Davenport", "And do you have incremental opportunities in controller -- in the area of controllers or just other portions of in the enabling technology within the system or would it be just be sort of one license for the end card make? ", "Eli Harari", "You would rather license the card makers than the controller makers. The controller maker's patent law, it says that we cannot license to controller and also separately double it if you will. If you license the controller manufacturer, and license to flash manufacturer, you basically have licensed -- you've licensed the card. We'd rather go after the card and separately from the memory, and not license the controller manufacturer. ", "Bennett Notman - Davenport", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you again. And that is all the time we have for questions. I would like to turn the program back over to today\u2019s presenters for any additional or closing comments. ", "Eli Harari", "Okay. So, I would like to thank everyone here for listening today and we are looking forward to seeing a number of you during our upcoming conferences. Thank you very much. Goodbye.

Today\u2019s conference is beingrecorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to LoriBarker, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Madam. ", "Lori Barker ", "", "Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the financialteleconference for SanDisk Corporation for the third quarter of 2007.  I\u2019m Lori Barker, SanDisk\u2019s Senior Director ofInvestor Relations. Joining me is Dr. Eli Harari, Chairman and CEO of SanDisk,Sanjay Mehrotra, President and COO, and Judy Bruner, Executive Vice Presidentof Administration and CFO.

Actual results may differ materially fromthose expressed in such forward-looking statements. ", "Certain factors that may cause actual results to differ aredetailed under the caption \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in the documents thatwe file from time to time with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form10-K for fiscal 2006 and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.  We undertake no obligation to update theseforward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. ", "Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our CEO, Eli Harari. ", "Eli Harari", "Thank you, Lori. Demand was remarkably strong in the thirdquarter, with high volumes straining our supply chain. We currently are sellingmore than one million cards per day, approximately half of which are for themobile card market, which barely existed three years ago and which we believeis only just beginning to take off. ", "The star product performers in Q3 were mobile cards and USBflashdrives. Also, our international sales are growing rapidly and reached 67%of total product sales in the third quarter. ", "The strong output from Fab 3 has allowed us to gain marketshare in key geographies where we were previously severely supply constrainedand our financial performance is becoming much less dependent on U.S. consumersentiment. ", "I want to share with you our current thinking on SanDisk\u2019sdemand and supply requirements in 2008 and beyond. We expect the number onedemand generator for Flash memory in 2008 to be storage in mobile handsets andwe believe that this market is entering an explosive growth phase with abarrage of new multimedia handsets that will be voracious users of embeddedFlash and Flash cards.  ", "We are very well positioned as a one-stop shop supplier ofboth the mobile OEM and the mobile retail fronts. In the third quarter, morethan 40% of our mobile revenues were generated through about 100,000specialized mobile retail outlets that now sell our mobile products.  ", "In emerging markets, we see the solid state disk market as akey strategic long-term investment.  Thisoverall market is projected to grow nicely in 2008, accelerating in 2009, andby 2010 or 2011, we project that Flash storage in solid state disk in computingapplications could become the second largest user of Flash memory after mobilehandsets. ", "We believe that our Flash systems expertise, and inparticular our MLC implementations as well as our extensive system IP, willbecome important differentiators in this market as it unfolds over the comingyears.  ", "Adding to the Flash demand equation are existing marketssuch as imaging, USB flashdrives, audio, video, gaming, navigation, andemerging markets such as enterprise, home entertainment, automotive and contentdistribution.  We believe that ourcombined projected demand from these markets will put us among the top threeconsumers of Flash memory. In 2008 and beyond, we believe our projected demandwill likely outstrip our total supply, even with some reliance on non-captivesources. ", "We plan to address our 2008 supply requirements in thefollowing ways. In Fab 3, we expect to maximize output through the followingsteps: first, complete the conversion to 56 nanometers in the first quarter of2008, second, convert a portion of the output of 56 nanometer to X3, that isthe three bits per cell, starting in March or April of 2008, and third, beginto convert to 43 nanometer in the second quarter of \u201808.  In Fab 4, we plan a fast ramp on 56-nanometerand we expect to begin conversion to 43-nanometer as soon as 56-nanometeryields have stabilized. In parallel, we expect to re-enter the non-captivemarket as a more significant customer in 2008.  ", "In 2009, we expect to continue ramping Fab 4 to its maximumcapacity. However, beyond 2009, we believe that we will need substantial newcaptive capacity if we are to retain our market leadership and competitivelyserve the very large markets that I just discussed. ", "Given that a new captive fab takes 18 to 24 months to plan,to build, equip, qualify, and begin to ramp, we have commenced discussions withToshiba for a potential joint Fab 5 for late 2009 or 2010 production starts.The timing for such a fab would be such that it would not require significantnew CapEx outlays before the second half of 2009 at the earliest.  ", "Also, under a previously announced Memorandum ofUnderstanding, we are in discussions with Hynix for a potential minorityinvestment in one of their 300-millimeter Flash fabs.  If that should transpire, the Hynixinvestment would be on a much more modest scale than a potential Fab 5 withToshiba. ", "As you can see the pace of business is picking up. We areaddressing opportunities in Flash markets of substantial scale, and theseentail substantial investments and risks. However, not all Flash competitorsare the same and I believe that SanDisk\u2019s captive supply and retail presence,technology leadership and growing consumer brand position us very well inpursuing our vision for sustained growth and market leadership in the comingdecade.     ", "I will now pass it on to Sanjay.             ", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Thank you, Eli. Q3 was a very busy quarter for SanDisk, withcontinued new product introductions and the new manufacturing plant openings ofFab 4 in Yokkaichi,Japan, and our first captive assembly and test facility in Shanghai. We madeexcellent progress in achieving market share gains in Europe and Asia andfurther lowering our unit costs. ", "In the third quarter, overall demand for our products wasstrong with total worldwide unit sales in the retail channel doubling on ayear-over-year basis, driven by strong unit sales increase in USB drives andmicro-SD cards. Further, demand for our high-capacity 2-gigabyte and 4-gigabytemobile cards was strong and the supply of these cards was constrained duringthe quarter, as we could not ramp up back-end assembly and test capacity fastenough to meet the accelerated demand.  ", "In the retail channel, during Q3 we shipped more mobile cardunits than we did in all of 2006. Infact, unit sales of the micro-SD card were at an all time record and it was thelargest single product in the SanDisk portfolio.  ", "The mobile OEM channel grew nicely and continues tocontribute more than half of our mobile revenue. However, revenue growth in theretail mobile channel accelerated and grew at an even faster rate.  ", "Going forward, we believe that video in mobile phones willbecome another strong driver for our high capacity products with shipments recentlystarted of multimedia 5-megapixel new phones like Nokia N95, Sony Walkman K850and others. ", "USB flashdrive revenues have resumed strong growth as a resultof combining, in the first quarter of 2007, our legacy SanDisk and msystems USBflashdrive teams under a single global organization.  We realized solid sales of USB drives in theU.S. market during the back-to-school season and we also made excellentprogress in overseas markets by expanding our channel reach, offering segmentedproducts, and tailoring our products to each region.   ", "According to GFK Europe, our overall retail market share incards and USB flashdrives grew by more than 350 basis points in the first twomonths of Q3 compared to the first two months of Q2, and now our market sharestands at about 28%; the highest share we have achieved in the Europe regionfor cards and USB flashdrives. ", "I am pleased to report that for the first time ever, weachieved number one European USB market share in August 2007.  We also observed strong market share trendsin the APAC region. As a result of our global sales push, our retail revenue ineach of the regions of Europe, APAC, and Japan grew by more than 50%sequentially. ", "On the manufacturing front, Fab 3 continued to lead theindustry in cutting-edge manufacturing technology. Fab 3 has now achieved itstarget capacity of 150,000 wafers per month and we are achieving excellentyields on our 56-nanometer process technology on both 8-gigabit and 16-gigabitdevices. ", "We expect 56-nanometer technology to account for more thantwo-thirds of our fab bit production output by the end of 2007 and we are wellunderway to begin the transition to 43-nanometer technology in the Q2 2008timeframe. Further, work on 32-nanometer technology development is proceedingwell. ", "Industry wide assembly capacity for high capacitymicro-sized mobile cards with multiple Flash memory stacked die is notsufficient to keep up with the rapid growth in demand. In that regard, ourtiming for our captive assembly and test facility in Shanghai is proving highlybeneficial to us. The Shanghai facility is on schedule for a meaningfulproduction ramp in 2008. ", "As we look to the seasonally strong fourth quarter, webelieve demand will be strong for our products and the benefits of low-cost 56-nanometerproducts should enable us to position and price our products attractively forholiday shoppers. ", "We expect continued revenue growth in our Sansa line ofmedia players with the addition of new products such as the Sansa Clip, a verysmall audio player with superior value, and the Sansa View, our firstvideo-enabled media player. In addition, our high capacity and high performanceproducts in imaging, mobile and computing markets will also continue to play animportant role in our growth in Q4 and beyond. ", "With that, I will hand over the call to Judy. ", "Judy Bruner ", "Thank you, Sanjay and Eli, and good afternoon everyone. Ourstrong third quarter performance is highlighted by exceptional megabyte growthin both retail and OEM channels, and in particular for our mobile handset andUSB businesses. ", "Our 54% sequential megabyte increase in Q3 is an outstandinggrowth rate for the summer quarter.  Thisgrowth reflects the continued development of the mobile handset mega-market forFlash memory and market share gains in Europe and Asia in both cards and USBdrives, the result of our strategic focus on growing share outside NorthAmerica.  ", "The 16% sequential decline in our ASP per megabyte, asignificant improvement from the 26% decline in Q2, stemmed primarily from Q3price quotes provided to our OEM customers in Q2 and retail price reductionsimplemented in June, which had a full quarter impact on Q3. We took very littlepricing action during the third quarter. ", "Our retail revenue increased 25% sequentially, withmegabytes sold up 46% and ASP per megabyte down 14%. Retail revenue was 66% ofproduct revenue during Q3, a comparable mix to the second quarter.  ", "On a year-over-year basis, our retail revenue grew a strong36% despite a 63% year-over-year decline in ASP per megabyte. Ouryear-over-year retail growth reflected an increase of nearly 100% in units soldand 267% in megabytes sold.  ", "Our strongest retail growth was in the mobile handsetmarket, where retail unit sales grew more than 300% over the prior year. Theaverage capacity of a mobile card sold in retail in Q3 was over 1.2 gigabytes,up 114% on a year-over-year basis.  ", "Our retail sales were also very strong in the USB marketwith both unit sales and average capacity up over 100% year-over-year. On anoverall basis, our average capacity in retail was 1.6 gigabytes, up 10%sequentially and 83% year-over-year, with the average growth rate influenced bythe increasing mix of mobile cards, which are at a lower average capacity thanUSB drives and camera cards, although growing at a very strong clip.   ", "Our OEM revenue increased 32% sequentially, with megabytessold up 82% and ASP per megabyte down 26%. On a year-over-year basis, OEM revenue grew 37% with megabytes sold up206% and ASP per gigabyte down 57%. OEM growth was dominated by the mobilehandset market, although we also had nice growth from bundled camera cards,cards for GPS devices, and a small contribution from solid state drivesales.   ", "License and royalty revenue for the third quarter of $119million increased 52% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. This growth wasslightly higher than we had forecasted due to higher MLC mix and better SLCpricing in our licensees\u2019 sales. ", "Our Q3 non-GAAP product gross margin of 26.4% improved 7.4points from the second quarter. The decline in our cost per megabyte wassimilar to the decline in our ASP per megabyte, with memory cost declines reflectingincreased scale and the beginning of the transition to 56-nanometerproduct.  ", "The primary contributor to the improvement in our grossmargin was a reduction in inventory charges. With inventory balances lower andprice movement less aggressive than in the first half, inventory charges weresignificantly down for both excess product issues and lower of cost or marketadjustments.  ", "Another favorable factor in Q3 gross margin was the receiptof a one-time insurance payment for claims we had filed related to a fab poweroutage which occurred in the first quarter of 2006.  Partially offsetting the favorable insurancepayment was Fab 4 start-up costs.  Webegan production in Fab 4 inSeptember, ahead of schedule, resulting in start-up costs charged to cost ofsales rather than R&D in the month of September.  The non-captive memory mix in our shipmentsremained below 5%.   ", "Non-GAAP operating expenses were $199 million, up $29million from Q2.  The growth in R&Dcame primarily from Fab 4 start-up costs in July and August and increasedengineering materials, masks and NRE.  ", "In sales and marketing, the major contributors were variableco-operative selling costs and higher spending on branding, merchandising andcollateral materials.  In addition, all expenseline items were impacted by the reinstatement of salary increases which hadbeen frozen from Q1, as well as higher spend on our IT infrastructure andincreased hiring. ", "We are carefully increasing our headcount and absoluteexpense investment, while still reducing our operating expenses as a percentageof revenue, targeting to be in our long-term model of 15% to 18% in 2008.   ", "Other Income came down sequentially, in line with ourprevious forecast, due to one-time gains in Q2 and a higher mix of tax-exemptinvestment income.  Our non-GAAP tax ratecame down to 35.1% on a year-to-date basis and to 32.3% for the quarter as ourprofits increased in low tax rate jurisdictions. ", "On the balance sheet, cash and investments, includinglong-term investments, remained unchanged at $3.2 billion.  We generated $339 million in cash fromoperations and $43 million in cash from employee stock programs, and weinvested $324 million in Fabs 3 and 4 and $82 million in property andequipment. Our Flash joint ventures drew down $131 million of operating leases,bringing our net operating lease guarantees to slightly above $1 billion. ", "Our accounts receivable are up $126 million and ourinventory is down $56 million compared to the second quarter, both due tosignificantly higher shipments in the third quarter. You can also see theimpact of the higher shipment level in our deferred income in the liabilitysection of our balance sheet, which is up $61 million.  Given the increased rate of sell-through,channel inventory is at a lean level of 7 weeks, and inventory on our balancesheet stands at 73 days, which is a lower level than we would prefer headinginto Q4.  ", "Before turning to our outlook, I\u2019d like to point out that weachieved a non-GAAP operating margin of 15.7% in the third quarter, moving intothe 15-20% operating margin range that we established as our 2008 target modelat our February 2007 Analyst Day. And on a year-to-date basis for 2007, we areat 10.7% non-GAAP operating margin, slightly above the 0% to 10% range that wepredicted for 2007 at the Analyst Day. We believe we have executedexceptionally well through the pricing volatility of recent quarters, and theinvestments we have made in capacity, technology and human resources are payingoff in market share gains and improving profitability.   ", "I\u2019ll now turn to our outlook. We expect strong demand forour product categories in the Q4 holiday season with growth primarily limitedby petabyte availability, given the completed expansion of Fab 3 and our lowinventory levels at the end of Q3. ", "We expect megabyte growth in the fourth quarter to be in therange of 45% to 60% sequentially, bringing our megabyte growth for 2007 toapproximately 200%. ", "We expect price decline in Q4 to be moderately more than the16% decline in Q3, driven primarily by Black Friday sales and other holidaypromotions.  The annual 2007 decline inASP per megabyte is forecasted to be in the low 60% range. ", "We expect our Q4 product revenue to be in the range of $1.05billion to $1.2 billion, and we forecast Q4 license and royalty revenue to beabout the same as Q3. ", "We expect fourth quarter gross margins to benefit from ahigher mix of lower cost 56-nanometer memory, with this impact partially offsetby a full quarter of Fab 4 start-up costs and Q4 price declines.  ", "We forecast non-GAAP Q4 product gross margin to be in therange of 27% to 30%. ", "We expect Q4 GAAP product gross margin to be lower thannon-GAAP by approximately two percentage points due to the inclusion of stockcompensation and acquisition-related purchase accounting charges. ", "We forecast Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses to be in therange of $240 million to $250 million with the growth from Q3 reflectingplanned spending on TV and other advertising, increased holiday merchandising,higher investment in certain R&D areas, partially offset by the eliminationof Fab 4 start-up costs from R&D, and increased spending on G&Ainfrastructure, including the start up of a new ERP project. Q4 GAAP operatingexpenses are expected to be higher than non-GAAP by an amount similar to the$35 million delta in Q3. ", "Other Income for Q4 is expected to be approximately $5million lower than Q3, due primarily to a continued shift to more tax-exemptsecurities which yield a better after-tax return.  We expect the non-GAAP tax rate for thefourth quarter to be 34%-35%. ", "On the balance sheet, we forecast that Q4 inventory levelswill be approximately flat compared to the Q3 level as we ship all we that canfor the fourth quarter, but with work-in-progress increasing as we ramp Fab4.  We expect to make Q4 investments inFlash joint ventures of approximately $200 million, and we expect to guaranteenew operating leases of approximately $130 million in Q4.   ", "In summary, we are very pleased with the improved top lineand bottom line performance in Q3 and we look forward to a similarly strongQ4.   ", "We will now open the call for your questions. ", "Question-and-AnswerSession", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)  We will take our first question from CraigEllis with Citigroup.", "Craig Ellis -Citigroup", "Thank you and congratulations on the quarter. Judy, can youclarify how much second sourcing you\u2019re assuming in the bit growth guidance of45% to 60%?", "Judy Bruner", "At the moment, we are looking at the potential of gettingsome more non-captive supply in the fourth quarter. However, it is not clearthat we will be able to get it in time to influence the fourth quarter. Let meturn that over to Sanjay and he can elaborate. ", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Yes, our non-captive in Q4, as Judy said, if we are able torealize those, would very much depend on the timing of those purchases and ofcourse the competitive pricing of those purchases. In all, we would expect thenon-captive purchases in Q4 frankly to still remain below 5%. ", "Craig Ellis -Citigroup", "Okay, and Judy, you\u2019re saying that that isn\u2019t included inthe guidance, or it is included in the guidance?", "Judy Bruner", "That level is included in the guidance. ", "Craig Ellis -Citigroup", "Okay, and secondly, just given the pricing mechanics in thethird quarter, I would have expected royalty guidance to go up sequentially.Can you just elaborate on that?", "Judy Bruner", "For our primary licensee, they have not made any clearcomments that we are aware of as to what their pricing was in the thirdquarter. We have tried to make our best estimate based on their bit guidancefor the third quarter, their bit reports for the third quarter, as well asestimates of their pricing and that\u2019s included in the total overall license androyalty. ", "Craig Ellis -Citigroup", "So are you saying that you are assuming that pricing didn\u2019tgo up for them in the third quarter?", "Judy Bruner", "We believe it may have gone up a little bit but we don\u2019thave a specific number. ", "Craig Ellis -Citigroup", "But you will have that when you close out the fourthquarter, obviously?", "Judy Bruner", "Obviously, yes, ", "Craig Ellis -Citigroup", "Okay, and then a follow-up for Eli; Eli, can you justprovide some commentary about how we should think about the ramp-up of X3 andhow much of the mix could be X3 by the time we exit next year?", "Eli Harari", "For X3, it\u2019s looking pretty good on 56-nanometer and wedon\u2019t really see any issues with qualification and ramping it up. It isdesigned to be pretty much broadly based -- in other words, general purpose,not limited to just benign applications but I would say that by the end of2008, the majority of our products, the majority of our megabytes will still betwo bits per cell, partially because we will along with X3 on 56-nanometer alsobe aggressively transforming the 56 to 43-nanometer on two bits per cell and Ibelieve at the 43-nanometer, MLC is still more cost effective than the56-nanometer X3. ", "Craig Ellis -Citigroup", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful, and lastly for me, you sounded confidentthat the company would have to increase its second sourcing next year. Can youjust elaborate on what you are seeing that leaves with you that degree ofconfidence?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "If you look at our Fab 3 production, which has now in termsof wafer output, maxed out at 150,000 or so wafers, and Fab 4 is just startingto ramp up and will contribute equally in 2008 timeframe. And you look at ourtotal demand requirements next year, we believe that we will not be able tofulfill all of that demand through just captive supply. We will be needing somenon-captive supply and the demand drivers that are really requiring that mix ofcaptive and non-captive we believe in 2008 are primarily driven by mobile, therecent applications of video, et cetera in mobile phones we believe will drivehigh capacity storage in mobile phones, as well as all of our other markets,particularly supplying to international growth, we believe will drive strongdemand in 2008. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Jim Covello with GoldmanSachs. ", "Jim Covello - GoldmanSachs", "Great. Good evening. Thanks so much. A couple of quickquestions; what are you guys estimating for a supply growth for the industryfor 2008 that leads you to believe that you will need to source captive supply,especially after what Samsung did with the CapEx increase last week?", "Eli Harari", "I think that we believe that we are entering a new baselinelevel, particularly with the handsets. I think that there\u2019s not enoughrealization in the market of how strong and how fast this market is moving interms of requirements for storage. It may have been kicked off by the launch ofiPhone, but really until today, a very small number -- I\u2019d say probably 30% ofthe phones that can use a card actually use it. We are seeing a very, verystrong move now to retail, to after market purchases of cards, one-, two-, andfour-gigabyte cards, and we think, as well as embedded. And the numbers thereare so large that if you just double the number of cards and then double themegabytes per card, you very easily I believe can outstrip whatever Samsung istalking about or the other players. ", "And then on top of that, of course, the 200-millimetersupply that is being retired next year that is very real. So I think that overall,2008 could be a year where there\u2019s a good balance between the managed supply,even with aggressive ramping of new capacity. ", "Now, there could be first quarter seasonality, weakness thatwe\u2019ve seen in the past, but for us at SanDisk as opposed to our competitors, wesee us being able to use everything that we can make and that\u2019s not beingsufficient to meet our forecasted requirements for next year. ", "Jim Covello - GoldmanSachs", "And then just a couple of other quick follow-ups; first, onthe solid state drive penetration for 2008, do you have any kind of percentagemaybe of the -- on the notebooks, what you think solid state drives couldrepresent of total notebook shipments in 2008? And could you offer someperspective on solid state drives in the data centers, when you think thatmight become a reality?", "And then my final question is, any update on the Samsungroyalty negotiations? Thank you. ", "Eli Harari", "Solid state disk, as I said, we believe is going to be avery, very substantial market and it definitely is very strategic. But until itmoves to the pricing of MLC, it\u2019s not really in my opinion going to take off.And so far, everybody\u2019s solid state disk, including our own, is based on SLC,and as you know, SLC component pricing has been very high up to this point andin that regard, it is definitely not helping this market in this stage to gobeyond the seeding stage. ", "I think in 2008, hopefully we will be able to move themarket to MLC and I think at that point, the pricing becomes much more realisticand much more attractive. ", "As far as the enterprise space, I think you asked, there isdefinitely market that eventually would be -- you know, a significant marketfor solid state disk. But in general, we still think that 2008, although itbecomes a real market for solid state disk, is still relatively small comparedto the growth in cell phones. ", "People are always looking, you know, where\u2019s the catalystfor 2008, and I could tell you for SanDisk, the catalyst very simply is cellphones and international. All those other markets of course we are addressing,but in relative terms, the handset market is so immense. The growth there isstrong and again, international, because we started from a very low marketshare and very low presence, represents for us in 2008, a very major opportunity nomatter what happens. ", "I don\u2019t mean no matter what happens, but under reasonableconditions and of course, we don\u2019t know about the Beijing Olympics and the U.S.elections and so on. ", "Jim Covello - GoldmanSachs", "Thank you.", "Eli Harari", "As far as Samsung, there is really nothing new to report.Everything that I said last time still applies. I think both companies wouldlike to come to some kind of resolution before the current process expires andthat still applies. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from [Ahmed Kapoor] from PiperJaffray. ", "Ahmed Kapoor - PiperJaffray", "Thank you. Just turning again to the handset market, youmentioned that you sold about $42 million mobile units in Q3. I guess doing themath, that looks at about 15% penetration. How should we think of thatpenetration going forward and what are some of the key drivers you are lookingat?", "Eli Harari", "I would not say 15% penetration. I would say that if thetotal number of handsets sold this year, if 0.5 billion cell phones have cardslots, assuming let\u2019s say 100 million handsets a quarter with a slot, 42million units is not 15%. It is much, much higher than that. ", "Ahmed Kapoor - PiperJaffray", "Okay, so -- ", "Eli Harari", "Because not all cell phones have a card slot. We are -- youknow, we started a campaign that we call \u201cwake up your phone\u201d to educate themarket about what the card slot is all about, because we think that mostconsumers today still don\u2019t really know that they can in fact put four, eight-gigabyteinto the cell phone and convert it into a very attractive music player. Sothere is education that has to happen but I think the heavy listing as far as [standardization]and slots and embedded is behind us. I think the iPhone is helping driving thatawareness amongst [consumers]. ", "Ahmed Kapoor - PiperJaffray", "That actually leads to my follow-up question in terms ofmost of the phones with memory card slots we see out there seem to be cappedoff at 2-gigabit densities. What do you think are some of the bottlenecks outthere and what do you think is necessary to get those densities up?", "Eli Harari", "We had a bottleneck last year that most of these phones weredesigned not to take the SDHC, the high capacity SD which caps at 32-gigabyte.I believe that the vast majority of cell phones are already designed to handlethe SDHC, which can go from 4 to 32-gigabyte. ", "Other than that, it\u2019s the cost of the cards but that iscoming down, so I think that -- Apple in fact eliminating the 4-gigabyte versionof the iPhone and just going with 8-gigabyte is in fact helping us go in theright direction. ", "I think at 3GSM in February in Europe, you are going to seea huge number of phones that have a lot of gigabytes. ", "Ahmed Kapoor - PiperJaffray", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Harlan Sur with MorganStanley.  ", "Harlan Sur - MorganStanley", "Thank you and great job on the quarter, the execution. Yourguidance, megabyte shipments up 45% to 60% in Q4, given the constraints,obviously, but if you didn\u2019t have these constraints, what do you think themegabyte growth would have been to support the true demand in the fourthquarter?", "Judy Bruner", "We\u2019re not going to speculate on what the exact growth ratewould have been. However, I will say that we believe it could have beensomewhat higher if we had ample supply. ", "Harlan Sur - MorganStanley", "Okay, and given the supply constraints, it sounds like youare pulling in the ramp of Fab 4. What is the barrier from motivating the teamto accelerate the ramp of 43-nanometer technology? Is it just too early days inthe technology development phase?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Actually, we are making very good progress on 43-nanometertechnology and as Eli mentioned, we will have 43-nanometer technology in Fab 3 startingto ramp up in the Q2 timeframe. So we are working as fast as we can in applying43-nanometer technology to the products, qualifying the products, and gettingthem ready for production ramp to begin in Q2. ", "Harlan Sur - MorganStanley", "Okay, great, and then just one last question; the status ofyour MLC controller development for SSD laptop applications, is the team stillon track to bring that technology out in the first half of next year?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Yes, we are working aggressively on bringing -- applying MLCto SSD and we plan to have products ready by mid next year with MLC/SLC. ", "Harlan Sur - MorganStanley", "Okay, great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Paul Koster with J.P.Morgan.", "Paul Koster - J.P.Morgan", "Thank you. I have three related questions. The first one is,is the capacity constraint that you see uniform across the industry, both witha short-term perspective and a sort of \u201908 perspective? In other words, are yougoing to lose market share to someone else during this period?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We do not believe that we will lose market share during thisperiod. The capacity constraint, despite our strong output from our fab, is onthe memory side as well as somewhat on the assembly and tests, and we areaggressively working on eliminating some of those bottlenecks and acceleratingthe output through our supply chain to really meet the strong demand that weare seeing for our products at this point. ", "Eli Harari", "I think that there could be some temporary market sharelosses in some regions. We have the -- the U.S. usually around Black Friday,the demand really goes through the roof and we sometimes have to take care ofthat. But we ought to be able to recover that, if that happens. ", "Paul Koster - J.P. Morgan", "I think a number of investors will probably be wonderingwhy, given the supply constraints, the gross margins aren\u2019t shooting up higher.Can you just explain why they are lower than this time last year when thecircumstances were very different, perhaps over-supply was occurring last timearound?", "Judy Bruner", "Paul, I would say that the primary reason, if you comparegross margin expectations for Q407 to gross margins in Q406, which is I thinkwhat you are asking, is that pricing has come down 60% plus and costs have notcome down to that level in the last year. ", "Eli Harari", "Year over year, I think we said pricing came down about 63%in retail and our costs, although came down very nicely, did not match thatlevel and that\u2019s the real difference. ", "Judy Bruner", "Now, the gross margins we expect will go up from Q3 to Q4,as I said, primarily because there will be a higher mix of 56-nanometer productin our Q4 cost of sales. But again, the cost reduction year over year is notenough to keep up with the price reduction in the low 60s range. ", "Paul Koster - J.P.Morgan", "My last question is we would ordinarily expect a depletionof channel inventory in the fourth quarter, and it sounds like it could be evenmore the case this year, given the supply constraints. What does this imply forthe beginning of \u201908 when I think people are concerned that over-supply rearsits head?", "Eli Harari", "Yes, I mean this -- we are just entering the real heavyselling season for the holiday sell season. I think the next two months willtell where things stand at the end of December, so I think it is premature tospeculate on what it is going to be, and certainly premature to speculate aboutQ1. We know typically, as you know, that seasonally it is weaker than thefourth quarter, but how much we don\u2019t know, because overlying the seasonality,there is also the underlying very strong growth that I mentioned. ", "Paul Koster - J.P.Morgan", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Tristan Gerra with RobertW. Baird. ", "Tristan Gerra -Robert W. Baird", "Good afternoon. We see a trend where there the central OEMsare increasing, embedded NAND Flash in some instances, de-emphasizing thebundling of the card. That\u2019s the case for the Nokia 95, for example. The 88version doesn\u2019t even have a card slot. Could you give us a sense of the margindifferential between your embedded business and your Flash card business? ", "And also, your view on the USS initiative and if that takesoff, what is the potential licensing indication for you?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "With respect to the embedded business, we are definitelylooking forward to 2008 our embedded business in mobile phone increasing. Weare seeing strong design wins for our iNAND products, as well as we have saidbefore, in the beginning of 2008 we will start shipping multi-chip packagesthrough our Qimonda joint venture. ", "The N95, 8-gigabyte phone with embedded flash that youindicated only gives a halo effect to increase awareness and making theconsumers aware that high capacities are needed to fully utilize the featuresof these phones. That is by the way, one example of an N95 model; there areother N95 models with card slots as well. ", "So while embedded in mobile phones, we expect it to increasefor our business in 2008 the card slots as well as card bundling for OEM andthe retail aspect of our business will continue to be strong drivers of mobilegrowth in 2008.", " Eli Harari", "On the UFS initiative, the spec is not out. The publicity,the advertising is this is going to be the greatest thing since sliced bread.It will have phenomenal performance and it will do things that no other cardhas ever been able to come close. So we'd like to see what happens. ", "As far as licensing or IP, I believe that we'll have to ofcourse see what the UFS does, but if it's a device with flash trying to emulatea disk drive or a mass storage device, I think that it will more likely thannot be covered by our very extensive licensing patent.", "Judy Bruner", " Tristan, let me alsoaddress the question you asked about the gross margin of embedded card productsversus removable card products for the phones. The answer is that there is nota significant difference for us in gross margin whether we sell an embeddedproduct or whether we sell a card that's bundled with the phone.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Daniel Amir \u2013 Lazard CapitalMarkets.", "Daniel Amir  - Lazard Capital Markets", "Congratulations on a good quarter. First of all, on the newtesting and assembly operations in China,Sanjay, can you comment a bit about how it's going and also what the potentialmargin impact this could have on your business in 2008?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", " So the assembly andtest operation in Shanghai is goingvery well. We are very pleased with our ability to introduce new technologiesfor high capacity mobile cards in this factory. ", "Our goal is ultimately for this assembly and test factory tomeet 30% of our unit requirements; of course, that will ramp over a period oftime, over the next few quarters. ", "In terms of the factory's ability to meet costs, it is verycost competitive but in addition to costs, this factory gives us the benefit ofagain being able to introduce fast to market, new advanced technology productsas well as gives us the flexibility to meet the increases in demand that takesplace in our business in times such as Q4. ", "But overall, we are pleased with the cost competitiveness aswell as the production ramp of this facility.", "Daniel Amir  - Lazard Capital Markets", "The margin impact?", "Judy Bruner", "The way that I would think about this is that producing aportion of our cards at this captive factory with very competitive costs isjust one of the ways that enables us to reduce the non-memory portion of ourproducts and try to keep the non-memory cost reduction in line with the memorycost reduction, which is achieved through the technology transition. So this isjust one of the many ways, but as Sanjay said, the cost is very competitive.", "Daniel Amir  - Lazard Capital Markets", "It seems like now that you are starting production here inX3 next quarter, can you comment on where X4 stands in terms of potentialproduction and how should we look at the future of both technologies as a majorsource of your future production?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So regarding X4, as we have said before, we are applying X4,we are implementing the designs of X4 on 43 nanometer technology. We will havesamples of X4 in 43 nanometer technology toward the end of the 2008 timeframe,and any production starts will really take place in the 2009 timeframe. ", "X3, Eli already mentioned that we will be ramping X3 in 56nanometer production in 2008. It will primarily be 56 nanometer; in 2009 itwill be 43 nanometer, and X3 will become an increasing portion of ourproduction output next year. The majority next year will still remain 2 bitmemory, even by the end of next year, and as we ramp up in 43 nanometer X3 in2009, its percentage as part of our total production will increase. ", "X3 has been designed with a total forecast on reliabilityand performance and we plan to apply X3 over time across all of our productlines. X4 technology will likely be applied first in certain products where itsperformance and specifications can be best utilized, such as possiblyaudio/video players.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Vijay Rakesh - Oppenheimer.", "Vijay Rakesh -Oppenheimer", "As you look at the non-captive mix for next year do youthink it grows? It looks like it's 11.5% here in Q3? Do you think '08 we goback to the 10% or 15% range?", " Eli Harari", "Yes, somewhere in that range in '08 timeframe. We are notprepared to put a stake in the ground yet for this, but we do believe that weneed non-captive, something around that range in the 2008 timeframe.", "Vijay Rakesh -Oppenheimer", " As you look at X3 and43 nanometer here, will X3 get to 5% of output by 3Q08? Do you think you canget it to that level by 3Q08 or you still think it's going to be a majority is2 bit?", " Eli Harari", " As we have said, byend of next year a majority of the output will be 2 bit, but X3 will continueto ramp during the course of the year.", "Vijay Rakesh -Oppenheimer", " Is 5%, 10% areasonable assumption for Q3?", " Eli Harari", "I think in the Q3 timeframe we will likely have somewhatmore than 10% in X3.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Gurinder Kalra - BearStearns.", "Gurinder Kalra  - Bear Stearns", "As far as your X3 and X4 is concerned, how do you thinkabout the licensing of the technology? Is there a part process which mightsuggest that let's keep it to ourselves and Hynix and not license it out toanybody else?", " Eli Harari", "X3 IP is somewhat different than X4 IP. X3 IP is verysimilar to MLC, 2 bits per cell. X4 is quite substantially more complextechnology and has its own relevant IP. So I think I would look at X3 and X4 somewhatdifferently. But at this stage I'd rather not comment on that.", "Gurinder Kalra  - Bear Stearns", "My second question, I know you can't comment about Q1 and Ihear you on the demand you are seeing, but we are looking at a lot ofincremental supply coming on sequentially as we go into Q4 and then Q1, andclearly spot pricing has been declining so the chip level pricing doesn't lookthat great. Obviously Q1 last year was pretty painful. What makes you soconfident that Q1 '08 will not have a similar level of pain?", " Eli Harari", "I've said it many times; let me say it again. We believethat our markets are very young and have really tremendous growth opportunitiesfor us over the next three to five years. We are really planning our future andour entire strategy is based on a fervent assumption that these markets aregoing to grow at a very fast pace and that we need to plan our destiny based ona very fast growth trajectory; vector ramping up, a pretty steep vector. Wecannot slow down in any one quarter, make quarterly course corrections that maylook good for our quarterly results in any particular quarter if that meansthat we sacrifice the big opportunity that we see that we think is very, veryunique. ", "We are very unique as a company in that we manufacture allour own flash. We're in a pretty good position, I believe, to use 100% of ouroutput throughout the next several years and we have the ability to use otherpeople's flash but we are not a component supplier of service at all. We areessentially building new markets.", "I just talked about the need eventually to ramp fab 5.Thereis no way that we can be a significant player in the solid state disk businessin 2010 and 2011 based on the output of fab 3 plus fab 4 plus anything that wecan get from the non-captive market. So these markets are huge, and it's just aparallel front of these markets growing at a very fast pace, and we just haveto plan for that based on our conviction in those markets. ", "So yes, we worry a great deal about what happens in Decemberor in January or by the first quarter and we manage the business as best we canthrough these difficult quarters, but in the long term, the strategy has provento be very successful for us, and we don't plan to change that model.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Edwin Mok - Needham & Co.", " Edwin Mok - Needham & Co.", "First question is regarding fab 3. Since you guys reached150,000 wafer starts is there any possibility that you guys can squeeze moreefficiency out of that fab and actually increase your wafer starts more in thefourth quarter?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "It may be possible to increase it a little bit, but reallynot by much. ", " Eli Harari", "We've asked all operators to lose a few pounds so they cansqueeze by in the aisles. I've never seen a Japanese fab. It's so tight, it isjust unbelievable.", " Edwin Mok - Needham & Co.", "Just a follow-up question also on the supply constraint. AmI understanding correctly that you have supply constraint because we can go anda buy non-captive supply, they're not qualified within your product? Is thatwhy you guys can go and buy supply from other suppliers? Because it seems to methat there's additional supply coming online in the fourth quarter. Is thatcorrect?", " Eli Harari", "Until very recently, non-captive supply was extremelyexpensive and would be very difficult for us to conduct our business purchasingat the price that was out there. ", "Secondly, I have to tell you without naming any names, thequality of flash MLC is really not the same and we do believe that the ToshibaSanDisk MLC quality is significantly ahead of what we can find there, and wehave to be very careful with what we buy. There's a lot of inferior productthat is dumped on the market at any price, and of course, consumers are not awareof that. We need to make sure that if we are in this market and buy substantialoutput of non-captive, that our controllers are sufficiently powerful, potentin terms of error correction and so on to make the those up to our standard.It's not that simple.", " Edwin Mok - Needham & Co.", " Do you think thatgoing forward though, in 2008, you guys might want to increase non-captive, butyou might be limited by the same issue at all?", " Eli Harari", "First of all, yes. We've said that we are looking atincreasing our non-captive. We think the non-captive model is a very healthymodel. It's a good model. It probably will not be the 70/30 that we've had inthe past, because I think frankly the numbers are so high looking forward, that30% of our capacity being non-captive would be a huge amount of supply forsomebody else to supply us. ", "But yes, moving more towards the 15%, 10% to 15%non-captive, I think is something that will be very healthy for us.", " Edwin Mok - Needham & Co.", "In terms of the mobile phone market, looks like Viper ST wasvery strong. Can you put any color on the embedded side, any new designactivity that you thought was standing out or in terms of growth in that area,what are you guys expecting for the fourth quarter?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "I cannot really specifically call out the design wins, but Ican tell you that for our product we do have design wins, and as I saidearlier, we plan to increase shipments of our embedded memory in the mobilephone in the 2008 timeframe.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Daniel Gelbtuch - CIBC.", "Daniel Gelbtuch  - CIBC World Markets", "Congratulations on a great quarter. I was wondering if couldyou give some color about or maybe hazard a guess as to where you see ASP permegabyte going down or declining in 2008? Do you think it's going to behopefully much better than this year in the 60s? Can we get back to anequilibrium level of 40 to 45 or 50?", " Eli Harari", "Honestly, I have no idea. If you had asked me at thebeginning of the year what would be the pricing for 2007, it went down reallylow in February/March. It went way up in the summer months. It's now headingback to where it was in February/March. I've never seen that before in the market, and I would not be able topredict it. I have no idea.", " Daniel Gelbtuch  - CIBC World Markets", " I'd say on a grandscale and a bigger scheme over the course of a year do you think the demandvectors are so strong, coupled with the supply shortages that you envision, youthink that we could have a better, more stable year, I guess, in the biggerpicture?", " Eli Harari", "Let me say that based on the technology on the cost of the50 nanometer technology compared to 63 nanometer technology, clearly the coststructure of 50 nanometer on 300 millimeter in high volume will allow the kind of pricingthat you are seeing in the market, as we speak for those companies that havethat kind of technology and production.", "I believe that this is a very exciting time for SanDisk.You've heard our thoughts of our growing markets, cards for mobile phones andindustrial markets, industrial sales.

(Operator Instructions) Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin. ", "Bob Blair", "Thank you. As we begin, I would like to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning: supply and demand conditions in the hard drive industry; growth opportunities and WD\u2019s strategies to address these opportunities; the planned volume ramp of our 250-gigabit per square inch technology; beliefs regarding our future capital expenditures as a vertically integrated hard drive manufacturer; our growth and pricing expectations; expectations regarding our bridge financing facility and future longer-term financing; and our current financial outlook for the March quarter.", "These forward-looking statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 6, 2007, as well as the additional risk factors reported in the press release included as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 8-K we furnished to the SEC today. ", "We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events, and you should not assume later in the quarter that the comments we make today are still valid.", "I will now turn the call over to Western Digital President and CEO, John Coyne. ", "John F. Coyne", "Thanks, Bob. Good afternoon, everyone. After my remarks, Tim Leyden will review our December quarter performance in detail and address our outlook for the March quarter.", "A year ago I spoke to you for the first time as CEO and outlined my commitment to continue the pursuit of profitable growth. I am happy to report that our December quarter results complete a calendar year of tremendous achievement by the WD team, a year in which we delivered industry-leading growth and financial performance, and during which we significantly strengthened our technology position and the fundamental WD business model.", "In calendar 2007, we increased revenues by 38% and earnings per share by 56% compared with calendar 2006.  More importantly, we have built momentum throughout the year and we exit the December quarter with revenue up 54% and earnings per share up 137% compared to the same quarter last year.  ", "Additionally, we maintained the financial asset management discipline which is a hallmark of WD, applying our expertise to the newly acquired WD media operation cycle times, and inventories, while also continuing to improve in head and drive operations, resulting in a sequential increase in inventory turns from 12.6 to 14.8.  ", "Hard drive finished goods inventory at the end of December was down 2% year-over-year, while we still achieved 54% revenue growth with consistent and responsive customer support.  ", "Capital spending at $332 million year to date is also disciplined and tracking in line with the previously announced reduction to our annual capital plan.", "I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the outstanding contribution of the entire WD team, the tremendous support of our supply partners, and the increasing preference of our customers for WD\u2019s value proposition. ", "Our high quality, high reliability products, our flexible and responsive service, our efficient large-scale operations, our investments in technology, capacity and capability, and our commitment to continuous improvement all contributed to these superb 2007 and December quarter results.", "WD\u2019s performance reflects that of a highly-motivated team operating with passion, taking appropriate and rapid action, focused on productivity, demonstrating relentless perseverance and innovation in technology, products and process, and balancing the needs of our customers, suppliers, shareholders, employees and the communities in which we operate with integrity.", "Opportunity is being created by a continuing surge in demand for traditional computing-related storage, further enhanced by emerging storage demand driven by rich content distributed over the Internet and personal content arising from the conversion of photography, audio and video from analog to digital technologies.  ", "For calendar 2007, demand for hard drives grew over 15% on a unit basis and 67% in total HDD storage capacity for a total of approximately 88 billion gigabytes of HDD storage. In the December quarter alone, units grew 20% and total HDD storage capacity expanded 70% versus the year ago period. This strong growth in units and total HDD storage capacity is expected to continue for the next several years.", "WD is capitalizing on growth opportunities through thoughtful strategies which we have executed very effectively in recent years.  I would like to briefly highlight a few of these key strategies.", "Five years ago, we identified that the market for 2.5-inch hard drives would become an increasingly important segment of the overall market.  We invested consistently and patiently in people, technology staging, product and process development and entered the market in September 2004.  Step-by-step, we began to build applications knowledge, business understanding and customer acceptance.  We maintained focus on our technology and reached a point in May of 2007 where we began volume shipments of the 250-gigabyte capacity, the industry\u2019s highest capacity two-disk 2.5-inch drive at that time. In late October, we followed up with our 320-gigabyte capacity, again leading the industry to volume with advanced technology and capacity. ", "This technology and product leadership is underpinned by high yielding, high quality, low cost design and manufacturing.  In the last year, we have tripled our output of mobile drives, shipping 8.7 million 2.5-inch hard drives in the December quarter.  Our technology and product momentum in this space, allied to our acknowledged reputation for quality, reliability, availability and responsiveness, bodes well for continued growth in this, the fastest-growing segment of the storage industry. ", "For many years, Branded Products was a successful but small element of our total product mix, consisting mostly of internal drive upgrade kits for desktop computers. About three years ago, demand in this category began to expand dramatically, driven by Internet content and the conversion of audio, video and photography from analog to digital, allowing consumers to process and store this content on computers and similar devices.  ", "Again, we made timely and appropriate investments in people to understand the emerging market, to design appropriate products, to establish the right channels and partners, and to lead and inspire our teams.  ", "Two years ago, Branded accounted for just 5% of sales. Today, Branded represents 18% of our hard drive revenues and WD is the leading storage appliance brand. ", "Adding to our presence in the Enterprise SATA market, we launched our Green Power line of drives mid-year and this product concept is finding significant acceptance in the enterprise customer base, addressing the need to reduce the power demands of large commercial storage farms.", "During 2007 we made three very important, long-term, strategic investments.  The first, with the acquisition of Komag, provides the ability to design and manufacture our own media.  Just like our head acquisition in 2003, WD Media is playing a key role in driving our future technologies, as well as further improving our cost model and our supply security and flexibility.

We are ramping production of our industry-leading 250-gigabit per square inch technology, first deployed on our 2.5-inch products last October, and now on our 3.5-inch product platforms, creating a common, highly leveraged, efficient, high-volume technology platform for our component and drive operations for the year ahead.  We will also see the full impact of our internal media operations as we move through the year.", "We continue to explore opportunities to broaden our product portfolio in existing markets and to enter new and adjacent market segments as it makes business sense. We are making appropriate investments to stage for these opportunities.  Consistent with WD tradition, we will make specific product announcements only when these products are available and shipping in volume.", "The future for our industry looks bright. Demand for storage capacity is forecast to continue growing at some 60% annually which, when addressed with areal density growth of 40% plus, translates into HDD unit growth in the high teens. ", "This demand is strong and broad based, with many new applications for our technology.  With an appropriate business model, good execution, aggressive cost management, great products and a rational approach to pricing, tremendous value can be created by addressing this surging demand for high capacity storage. ", "While there may be concern about the impact of macro economic conditions on demand for storage, we have yet to see any effect on actual usage or order rates or on forecasts from our customers.  The availability of weekly industry information on inventories, sell-in and sell-thru to all channels enables us and the other industry participants to act swiftly whenever we see an imbalance between demand and supply.

They reflect crisp and timely execution by the WD team, strong demand for hard drives, and a rational competitive pricing environment.  ", "Our operational flexibility enabled us to quickly react to a number of attractive market and product mix opportunities throughout the quarter. These opportunities continued to arise after our revised guidance in early December, resulting in additional upside.  Coupled with continued progress on the integration of our media operations and our ongoing focus on asset efficiency and cash management, these factors led to exceptionally strong revenue, earnings and cash flows in the December quarter. ", " ", "Revenue for our second fiscal quarter was $2.2 billion. This includes $120 million from external sales of media and substrates.  Hard drive revenue was up 46% from the prior year, and hard drive shipments totaled 34.2 million units, up 40% from the prior year.  ", "Average hard drive selling prices were approximately $61 per unit, up $2 from the September quarter and up $3 from the year-ago quarter as a result of firmer pricing, due to the strong demand for hard drives coupled with an improved segment and product mix.

Demand for mobile storage continues to increase and our quality, technology leadership, product offerings, operational flexibility, and responsiveness have solidified our position as a valued partner to PC manufacturers, major distributors and retailers. ", "In consumer electronics, we shipped 4.1 million 3.5-inch drives for use in digital video recorders in the December quarter versus 3.7 million in the September quarter and 2.7 million in the year-ago quarter. This market continues to offer long-term growth opportunities and demonstrates the potential of non-PC based consumer electronics systems incorporating hard drives. However, pricing in the DVR market does not currently provide adequate returns to justify incremental capacity expansion to fully support these growth opportunities. ", "Desktop product shipments were better than expected.  Unit shipments were up 10% from the September quarter as compared to 5% for the market as a whole.  During the quarter, while we honored our pre-existing OEM commitments, we focused on satisfying upside demand from the distribution channel first, as desktop OEM margins, like DVR, are less attractive than other market areas. Sales into the enterprise market, our highest margin segment, were in line with our expectations.", "Continued growth in shipments of hard drives for non-desktop PC applications has led to a substantial improvement in the diversification of our revenue and customer base.  ", "Hard drive channel revenue was 48% OEM, 34% distribution and 18% branded products versus 50% OEM, 31% distribution and 19% branded in the September quarter; and it was 46% OEM, 37% distribution and 17% branded in the year-ago quarter.

These percentages also exclude external sales of media and substrates.", "Our gross margin percentage for the quarter was 23.3% versus 18.3% in the September quarter and 17.9% in the year-ago quarter.  This increase was a function of the favorable industry conditions I referred to earlier and our ability to quickly react to the opportunities for volume increase, pricing and mix optimization presented by this stronger demand.

", "I am pleased to report that the media acquisition was accretive to the December quarter, our first full quarter of operations.  This is two quarters earlier than we originally forecast and is due to higher internal usage, higher external sales and more rapid progress in yield and utilization than originally contemplated.

During the December quarter, the market values of some of the auction-rate securities we owned as of the beginning of the quarter were impacted by the macroeconomic credit market conditions. We reduced our investments in auction-rate securities from $197 million at the beginning of the quarter to $43 million as of the end of the quarter.

This revenue range includes $50 million from sales of media and substrates to external customers, down from $120 million in the December quarter as we complete our obligations to supply external customers.  ", "Historically, drive demand goes down sequentially from December to March by from 3% to 5%.  However, demand for the December quarter was unusually strong for the industry.  We grew volume, mix and pricing as a result of our ability to quickly react to this demand strength, our leadership position in certain markets, and significant productivity improvements achieved in the quarter.  We view this combination of circumstances as extraordinary and unlikely to fully repeat in the March quarter.  Accordingly, we are currently modeling a sequential decrease in the range of 6% to 10% in our hard disk drive revenue for the March quarter.", "As a consequence of the strength of demand and rational behavior in the second half of calendar 2007, the hard drive industry appears to have achieved an overall uplift in margins by all major participants.  Our results demonstrate the profit potential for those companies with an effective cost structure who execute well, where all industry participants focus on profitability, cash generation and demand/supply management.  Also, we continue to believe that our blended internal and external media supply model will deliver cost improvements at the gross margin line of up to 300 basis points by the end of calendar 2008.  ", "The accelerated progress of our media integration, our changing segment mix, and an expectation of continued rational market behavior now enables us to reset our gross margin model from our historical 15% to 20% range up to the 18% to 23% range. Gross margin for the March quarter is anticipated to be in the middle of our revised model, at approximately 20%. While this is down from the December quarter, it is up significantly from the 15.8% gross margin we reported for the March quarter of 2007.

It\u2019s very impressive to me. I just wanted to talk a little more about Komag, and you say there\u2019s still more room for margin improvement as we go through to the end of the year. What are you estimate that Komag being accretive this quarter added to your margins? Was it around 75, 100 basis points?", "Tim Leyden", "About 80 basis points. ", "Mark Miller - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.", "Okay. Second question; was there any change -- did you do more heads internally this quarter or was that flat roughly quarter to quarter in terms of percentage of total heads you did internally versus externally?", "John F. Coyne", "I think roughly on a percentage basis, roughly flat from the prior quarter. ", "Mark Miller - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.", "Okay. Could you just break down the inventory for me? I know it\u2019s up somewhat. It\u2019s not unusual but could you break it down? And maybe you did that and I missed it in terms of finished goods and raw materials and work in progress. ", "Tim Leyden", "Actually, our inventory turns improved from 13 to 15 in the quarter and finished goods were up from 151 up to 157 million, but as we indicated, that\u2019s actually down from the same period last year.

", "Operator", "Richard Kugele.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company", "Thanks a lot and I guess first, since it will affect your gross margin and my model, is Komag actually able to help you on some of these newer areal densities you are announcing, at least in the desktop side? Or are you buying those parts on the outside and using Komag for more the mainstream?", "John F. Coyne", "Rich, we\u2019re both in the June or May and October 2.5-inch programs and in the 3.5-inch 320-gig per platter that we just announced, we have capability on both our internal heads and media, as well as capability from our external suppliers. So we use a blend of both. ", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay, and then from a capacity standpoint, how long -- I guess a lot of the $100 million you\u2019ve spent to date has really been just on bringing the media business up to a greater percentage perpendicular, but how long do you think it will be before you actually have to add capacity on that side?", "John F. Coyne", "Some time, given that we expect to -- and the 300 basis point full year contribution on the cost side is driven from an expectation of yield utilization and throughput, increased capability from focus on a much narrower set of products. And we experienced, if you\u2019ll recall, in the 2003-2004 experience of ramping the internal head capability, that a very significant contribution on yield and throughput capability came from rationalizing the product mix. ", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay. Thank you very much and well done. ", "Operator", "Richard Kaiser.", "Richard Kaiser - Sanford C. Bernstein", "I just wanted to inquire about a couple of comments you made pertaining to high velocity and high visibility. Historically in the storage disk drive markets, there have been a lot of volatility around pricing associated in part because of the distributor channel and I wanted to get your sense for if that has changed or not. You seemed in your comments to talk about more stability, more rational behavior, all major players. I just wondered if you could provide some color on that. ", "John F. Coyne", "Yes, I think over the years, the reporting from the distribution channel has been significantly improved in terms of its timeliness and overall encompassing of the entire distribution set worldwide. Recognize also at the same time the number of drive companies has reduced significantly and the concentration of product through large distributors has increased. ", "So total visibility in the entire distribution channel has improved dramatically over the past several years. We now have visibility to sell in and point of sale data, as well as of course visibility to manufacturing inventories servicing the large OEMs on a weekly basis for the entire industry, and all industry participants have access to that data. ", "I think our ability to manage demand and match with supply has been dramatically improved over the last several years. ", "Richard Kaiser - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Okay, great. And then just one follow-up; there was something I didn\u2019t quite understand. It was a comment with respect to pricing, I think it was, of DVR and it did not warrant additional investment. Could you just clarify what you meant there? I\u2019m sorry, I missed that. ", "Tim Leyden", "That market is a bit below the set of returns that we would like to see and what we are doing about it is where it\u2019s a two-sided proposition. We are obviously going to work on our costs in order to make it more attractive to the customers. We are also going to work with the customers in order to make sure that they are aware and value our value proposition that we bring to the table. ", "So really what we are saying is that we are directing our capacity to the more profitable segments and parts of the business and that one is below what we would like to see. ", "Richard Kaiser - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Great. Just one final question, if I might, and that is now you\u2019ve made a point about how the business model is much more diversified and this gives you more flexibility and I\u2019m just wondering if, in the context of consumer spending, we should also see that as a greater risk here. ", "John F. Coyne", "I don\u2019t believe so. I mean, if you look at the overall market data, typically most weight is given to the behavior of the IT and computing segment as it relates to potential hard drive sales. If you look at 2007 data, roughly 300 million PC systems shipped in 2007, while 500 million hard drives were shipped in 2007, so we\u2019re getting an increase, a significant increase in the level of demand for large capacity storage devices that are not linked directly to the sales rate of PCs or industrial computing applications. ", "Richard Kaiser - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Great. Thank you. ", "John F. Coyne", "I think that augers very well for balance and opportunity as we look forward. ", "Richard Kaiser - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "David Bailey. ", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "A couple of questions, if I may; the first, could you comment on how much capacity you are adding this year? And do you have any idea what the expectations are for the industry versus that sort of mid- to high-teens unit growth that you are expecting?", "John F. Coyne", "Well, I think our observations relative to industry capital, Seagate announced last week their intention to be very disciplined and frugal in relation to capacity investment. I think we\u2019ve just reconfirmed that our capital plan, which we reduced by $50 million from 750 to 700 in our last call, that we\u2019re sitting on the lower end, the 700 guide for our capital for the full year. So we are taking a very measured approach to capacity. ", "The good thing is that the improved visibility we have into the demand and inventories in all channels gives us a much better informed base from which to make our capital decisions. We have also worked very hard in the past few years with our capital equipment suppliers, particularly as it relates to drive assembly capability and drive test capability, to shorten lead times so that we can react much closer to the visibility to true demand. And I think you\u2019ve seen and the 2007 performance reflects all of those improvements in both visibility and execution of matching supply capacity to true demand. ", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "And just to follow up on that on the visibility side, is your visibility longer range or is it more just a better idea of what\u2019s going on in the short-term?", "John F. Coyne", "I think it\u2019s a combination of the two. I mean, on a long range basis, we\u2019re looking at the fundamental underlying drivers that are generating the 67% demand profile that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years for billions of gigabytes of storage. ", "As we come closer in to customer forecasts, customer orders, inventory levels, we have the ability to look at how we should match against that emerging short to medium term demand profile.", "And the other element that has helped in this regard is that as the late 2006, early 2007 returns in the industry were inadequate to fund aggressive investment looking at capacity going forward. ", "Our OEM customers are beginning to realize the need to be more longer term in their views, and so we\u2019ve seen a number of our OEM customers entering into multi-quarter agreements with us now to secure that most critical of all items, which is availability, to support their business plans. ", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "Great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Steven Fox.", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "I was wondering, just looking at your outlook if you could talk about what you think happens to your branded sales as you go into the March quarter, since there\u2019s not  a lot of history there? What are your retail customers telling you?", "And then secondly, just getting back to that DVR comment, can you sort of quantify what that means in terms of your unit outlook going forward? Does it mean you hold steady at current levels or actually grow at a lower rate? I\u2019m just trying to get a better feel for that. ", "John F. Coyne", "Let me deal with branded first. The first calendar quarter is typically a strong quarter for branded products, particularly January/February period where we get a gift certificate redemption kind of boost to the market after the Christmas shopping period. ", "What we are hearing from our retailers right now is that although they have some challenges, storage and particularly WD-branded storage is a very bright spot for them in terms of their retail sales in the stores, so we\u2019re very encouraged by what we see so far in the quarter. ", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, and then on the -- ", "John F. Coyne", "The second part of the question was the CE space, the DVR. Again, the typical seasonality there is that it falls off significantly into the first calendar quarter, so typically volumes are down quarter to quarter. ", "Our comment relative to margin contribution is more a question of what kind of capacity we put in place to support the July through December period next year, in 2008. ", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Sherri Scribner.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "I just wanted to explore a little bit more into your out-performance in the notebook side of the business. Do you feel like that\u2019s OEMs coming to you because you have a superior areal density product or because you have a superior quality product? Can you maybe give a little detail there?", "John F. Coyne", "All of the above, Sherri. I think the really interesting observation is that the vast majority of the notebook marketplace is still seeking increased storage capacity. Case in point -- the latest IDC preliminary data for the December quarter indicates that SSDs shipped in notebook computers reached some quantity short of 5,000 units for the entire quarter. Hard drive of capacities of 250-gigabytes and 320-gigabytes shipped over 3.25 million units, of which WD supplied the majority. ", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, great and then -- ", "John F. Coyne", "Technology is important in this marketplace -- good, high capacities are important in this marketplace and of course, you must deliver that leading edge technology with high reliability and high quality as a given. ", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thank you. And then in terms of if I look at your share now, I mean, you\u2019ve gained significant share Q-over-Q, probably somewhere approaching 20% share of the notebook market. There\u2019s a lot of players in that market. Do you think that you are tapped out in terms of future share gains? How much share do you really think you can get beyond where you are right now?", "John F. Coyne", "Well, that will be an outcome for our customers to decide. All things being equal, you would think that with six players, there\u2019d be one-sixth of the market for each. However, all things are never equal and our opportunity in that market is down to our ability to execute and to continue to delight customers with the right products that suit their product plans, and I believe we are very well-positioned to keep delighting our customers in that space. ", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, maybe just quickly, do you have any -- what do you think about these three-platter notebook drives that are coming out at 500-gigabytes capacity? Do you think there\u2019s demand there? Do you think there\u2019s any issues with those drives?", "John F. Coyne", "Well, I think the -- as we do, I think it\u2019s a strong endorsement of the view that there is a strong appetite for high-capacity solutions, both in the notebook and in the portable branded product space for 2.5-inch drives. So that\u2019s the really good news. ", "As I mentioned when I was talking about WD's future plans relative to markets, we announce products when we are shipping them in volume and we will continue to follow that practice. We will support our customers in meeting that currently insatiable appetite for large capacity drives for the notebook space. ", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, great. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Mark Moskowitz.", "Anthony Lescrit - JP Morgan", "This is Anthony [Lescrit] for Mark Moskowitz. Going back to the branded business, can you contrast the relative strength in the European versus the U.S. markets and what have you seen through January thus far? ", "John F. Coyne", "I think we are doing well in both geographies and consistent with our expectations relative to the seasonal patterns we have observed over the last couple of years. ", "Anthony Lescrit - JP Morgan", "Okay, and going forward, how much of the channel in OEM replenishment is supporting guidance for the March quarter, given the low base exiting December?", "John F. Coyne", "We don\u2019t really look at our replenishment in terms of -- we\u2019re happy with where the inventories are today. If I look at the total industry inventories, and that would be manufacturers inventory that we have in our own facilities and in the customer OEM JIT hubs and in transit, and I look at the channel inventories that our distributors hold on an industry-wide statement, on a combination of 2.5 and 3.5 SATA and PATA drives, which is the served market for WD, the days of inventory for the entire industry supply chain were down 11% year over year as of the end of December, and as of the beginning of week three of the current quarter, we are down 13% on a year-over-year basis. ", "So I think the industry is manufacturing at a rate that is in very good synchronization with the actual demand. I think the inventories are in a very good place and so WD is pretty happy with the environment right now from an inventory supply management perspective. ", "Anthony Lescrit - JP Morgan", "Okay, thanks and one last question -- what was your capacity utilization exiting the quarter and expectation for March? Thanks. ", "John F. Coyne", "Well, pretty full last quarter. We basically ran hot all quarter long and mixed to the best opportunities we could find in the demand space. We did not satisfy all available demand. Consequently, we expect to run pretty good utilizations through the March quarter. And understand under WD's model, we feel no compulsion to run our factories flat out. We run them efficiently. We take appropriate action to match hours worked and manning to demand levels but we do not need to run at 100% utilization to make money. In fact, we can run very significantly lower levels with that, so we match our supply to the demand that we see and we get visibility of that demand on a weekly basis and we\u2019ll take appropriate actions. ", "Anthony Lescrit - JP Morgan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Aaron Rakers.", "Aaron Rakers - Wachovia ", "Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the clean quarter. I would like to dive a little bit deeper into the gross margin line. You had said that 80 basis points from the Komag acquisition -- it would be very helpful to understand where the remaining sequential 420 basis points came from, be it mixed shift in terms of capacities. ", "What I\u2019m trying to get to is if I look at the mix of business towards mobile, are we starting to see mobile carry a better-than-average gross margin for the company? ", "Tim Leyden", "Yes, you are, Aaron. If you look at what we\u2019ve already indicated, enterprise is our highest margin product. Branded products is our next highest margin product and notebook comes pretty closely after that. And then there\u2019s a bit of a gap between desktop and consumer electronics. ", "Aaron Rakers - Wachovia ", "And so with that being said, as we roll into this next quarter, that 20% guidance roughly, that is factoring -- correct me if I\u2019m wrong, you\u2019re saying 300 basis points by the end of the year from Komag split across these next two quarters. With that being said, are you being a little bit cautious and seeing that come back due to pricing or why are you seeing that come back a little bit?", "Tim Leyden", "Actually, the difference between the 80 basis points and the 300 basis points is actually spread over four quarters because it\u2019s the end of calendar --", "Aaron Rakers - Wachovia ", "Okay, that\u2019s good. Thanks for the clarification. And I guess the other thing is on the channel inventory trends, where are you at in terms of weeks of channel inventory for yourself and relative to that to the industry?", "John F. Coyne", "We are sitting above the midpoint of our four to six week range. ", "Aaron Rakers - Wachovia ", "Okay. Thank you very much. ", "Tim Leyden", "Actually, on the four to six week range there, we will -- as we look at that, we are currently combining in that number both the bulk distribution and the branded products pipeline. So as branded products becomes a large amount of business for the industry and for ourselves, it\u2019s likely that we will have to split that out going forward because the pipeline for branded product is in the seven to nine week range and the distribution bulk is in the four to six weeks range. ", "Aaron Rakers - Wachovia ", "A final question, if I can jump in real quick; given your comments earlier, are you implying that for your notebook business -- what\u2019s your average capacity for your notebook drives right now relative -- I believe Seagate told us that it was somewhere around 135. I\u2019m trying to understand how much you are benefiting from just the technology leadership in that space. ", "Tim Leyden", "We don\u2019t publish what the average mix is but I will tell you that we did have a rich mix for the quarter and as we go into the next quarter, we don\u2019t anticipate that that mix will be as rich because it will probably gravitate more towards the industry mix as there will be more participants in that, providing the higher capacity drives. ", "Aaron Rakers - Wachovia ", "Okay. Thank you, guys. ", "Operator", "Jeff Brickman.", "Jeff Brickman - UBS", "I just wanted to ask a little more on the branded business. What do you see out there from the competition? And I guess more specifically, what advantages do you think you have that clearly have led to this solid growth? And do you think going forward that you can maintain a share position similar to what you see out there today?", "John F. Coyne", "Well, I think the advantages we have were an early start, very good industrial design, and very good ease of use software and product configuration, and very healthy relationships with our partners in the channels that take us to market. So we\u2019ve got a very strong position, very well-recognized by the consumer and we\u2019re going to continue to try to capitalize on those strengths as we move forward here. ", "Jeff Brickman - UBS", "And do you see anything from the competition, or anything new out there that makes you think that it might be more challenging to maintain what appears to be a very high level of market share going forward?", "John F. Coyne", "Well, I mean, competition is always tough in this business but we\u2019re frankly more focused on the opportunities and the kinds of products and the markets and geographies and partners that we need to be choosing in order to sustain growth in that market and accelerate growth in that market than we are looking in the rear-view mirror to see who\u2019s behind us. ", "Jeff Brickman - UBS", "Understood. And then, over on the competitive side in general, did you see anything in the way of increased price aggression at all towards the end of the year, or so far in this quarter, in January?", "Tim Leyden", "What we are seeing really in January so far is normal, typical pricing behavior. I mean, it\u2019s always a tougher quarter than the Q2 quarter and we\u2019re seeing exactly what we expect at this particular point. ", "Jeff Brickman - UBS", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys. ", "Operator", "Keith Bachman.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets ", "Tim, to follow the last question, what are your like-for-like pricing assumptions for the March quarter?", "Tim Leyden", "We don\u2019t actually give out like-for-like pricing but as I indicated, we\u2019re expecting typical seasonal type of price decline, and that\u2019s what we are seeing so far. ", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets ", "Okay. Seagate -- on the notebook side, Seagate has the 250-gig notebook that they are shipping now. As you guys, you wouldn\u2019t answer the previous question on your capacity points on the 2.5-inch, but can you indicate whether off of such a high base that you anticipate maintaining share this quarter, losing a little share, gaining share on the 2.5-inch side on a sequential basis?", "John F. Coyne", "Well, as I indicated, we\u2019ve been shipping the 250-gigabyte capacity since May of last year and have a substantial share in the 250. And we do expect to have, as more people join with the capability to address that capacity point, we do expect to see some pressure there. However, we now have since October the 320-gigabyte capacity, which gives us the opportunity to satisfy our customers\u2019 needs, to continue to increase the product offering in terms of the storage capacity that they can offer in their high-end product mix. ", "And so we are baking into our numbers the expectation that there will be other competitors at the 250-gigabyte capacity point, but we are expecting that we will see a significant move up to 320. We\u2019ve already begun to see that happen. ", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets ", "Okay, so 320 is still at a competitive advantage in your eyes for Western Dig?", "John F. Coyne", "Absolutely. ", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets ", "Okay. Tim, one last one for me -- rich cash flow this quarter. Your debt level is at 770-something and change. I know you are refining everything but as you think about the next three quarters, how will you think about applying the cash to pay down the debt versus growing the cash balance? How should we be thinking about the debt balances as we roll forward?", "Tim Leyden", "Well, it\u2019s a term loan which gives us -- we\u2019ll have a mix of revolver and term loan, and we are obviously -- we haven\u2019t figured out yet how much of the refinancing is going to be revolver. We are still in negotiations with the banks about that but I mean, it will be -- what we will do as always is we will figure out what the most appropriate structure is and continue to take advantage of opportunities. Maybe if the share price, we still have $46 million left in the share repurchase authorization and if the opportunity presents itself and the market continues to give the sort of opportunities -- the macroeconomic market, I\u2019m talking about -- continues to give the opportunities there, we would be opportunistic relative to buying back shares. ", "", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets ", "Interesting. Okay, thank you. ", "Operator", "Joel Inman.", "Joel Inman - Robert W. Baird", "Can you talk a little bit about opportunities for further expansion in the enterprise market, with maybe new protocols or new product offerings?", "John F. Coyne", "We have indicated that we have strong growth opportunities in all the currently served markets and those opportunities arise through the growth of those markets, as well as the opportunity to out-execute on quality, reliability, and customer service and products. And we\u2019ve also indicated that there are other parts of the market -- gaming, high performance enterprise -- where we don\u2019t currently compete and that it is our intention over time to be a full line supplier to the industry. ", "Outside of that, we\u2019ll announce products as we ship them. ", "Joel Inman - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, thanks. And just one follow-up; can you give us some idea of the Komag revenue wind-down over the course of this year?", "Tim Leyden", "As we indicated, it will be -- we are forecasting it to be $50 million this quarter and after that, it will be so insignificant that we won\u2019t be breaking it out. ", "Joel Inman - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "[Jayhin Garani].", "Jayhin Garani - Standard & Poor\u2019s", "Just a couple of housekeeping I think I missed -- on the channel breakout for the December quarter, could you just tell me what the disti and the OEM was, please?", "Tim Leyden", "OEM was 48%, distributors was 34%, and retail was 18%. ", "Jayhin Garani - Standard & Poor\u2019s", "Right, and then I just wanted to get your impression. You did mention SSDs and the units shipped, the IDC number. We also heard from EMC about incorporating an SSD drive, an enterprise SSD drive. What is your view on that and give me some color on what you think about that?", "John F. Coyne", "I think the -- I think both of the areas where SSDs have shown up so far are valid niche markets. But they are niche markets and it\u2019s a significant endorsement to see EMC bring out a product at the very high end of the performance spectrum. But recognize of the 8 million or so drives shipped into that enterprise space, less than 2 million are addressing high performance in that category of performance, and this SSD announcement is a small slice of that small slice. ", "So it\u2019s a niche application which offers some opportunity for system designers to tune performance. ", "Jayhin Garani - Standard & Poor\u2019s", "Okay, but longer term, what would you have to see to even consider that technology to be something that you would address?", "John F. Coyne", "As those niche applications grow, and I\u2019m confident they will grow, we look at -- if you look at the characteristics, Flash is media. You have to then match that up with a controller and applications knowledge and knowledge of how to put that whole thing together in a reliable way to make it look and behave like a hard drive, which is the application. ", "And so who better to take media and integrate it and ship it into a market where there is deep experience and knowledge of the application than the hard drive companies. So as we see that market becoming large enough to justify the engineering investments, it\u2019s highly likely that you will see WD and other drive manufacturers address that market segment. ", "Jayhin Garani - Standard & Poor\u2019s", "I guess what I was trying to determine, and maybe you did give me some hint about that, is how much of an engineering effort, if you will, does it take for you to get there versus the IP that you already have in-house? Or is it something you can go out and buy?", "John F. Coyne", "Be aware that in 1989, Western Digital was shipping SSDs in partnership with SunDisk, which was a precursor to the current SanDisk, so there is a significant body of knowledge relative to how to take solid state media and incorporate it in a drive product. ", "Jayhin Garani - Standard & Poor\u2019s", "Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Thank you and our last question comes from Richard Kugele.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company", "Thanks for the quick follow-up here. Two quick ones; seasonality, what are your expectations for the industry in the first quarter? I know you are talking about if the December was an out-size quarter for you that perhaps your sequential will be a little bit greater. We\u2019ll see if that plays out but in terms of the industry expectations, what are your thoughts there for the first quarter?", "Tim Leyden", "We\u2019re anticipating 3% to 5% reduction in the TAM quarter-on-quarter. ", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay, and then lastly, since you brought it up about break-even being lowest in the industry, I know Seagate has made public comments that theirs is now down to 12% to 13% gross margin, that they would be able to break even. Do you have any comments on where we should be thinking yours is post Komag?", "Tim Leyden", "Not really, no. ", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. John Coyne. ", "John F. Coyne", "Thank you, Operator. In closing, I want to thank you all for joining us today. I\u2019d also like to thank again our employees, our suppliers, and our customers for an outstanding December quarter and we look forward to updating you on progress as we execute our strategies and address the vast opportunities we see ahead of us in the storage market.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lori Barker, Senior Director of Investor Relations. ", "Lori Barker Padon", "Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the financial teleconference for SanDisk Corporation for the fourth quarter of 2007. I am Lori Barker, SanDisk's Senior Director of Investor Relations. Joining me is Dr. Eli Harari, Chairman and CEO of SanDisk; Sanjay Mehrotra, President and COO; and Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President of Administration and CFO. ", "The agenda for today\u2019s teleconference is as follows; Eli will start with an update on the industry and SanDisk's overall strategy; Sanjay will follow with operational and business updates; and Judy will end with our fourth quarter financial results and future guidance. We will conclude the teleconference with your questions for Eli, Sanjay, and Judy.

We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof. ", "Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our CEO, Dr. Eli Harari. ", "", "Dr. Eli Harari", "Thank you, Lori. We emerged from the challenging 2007 as a stronger SanDisk.  Despite a 60% price decline for the year, we were able to increase annual revenues by 20% and improve non-GAAP operating margins throughout the year from 6% in the first quarter to 18% in the fourth quarter. ", "We successfully completed the integration of our msystems acquisition, we grew our international sales, and we expanded our mobile business to be our number one revenue contributor.  ", "Our investments in leading-edge captive flash capacity and technology went well during the year and we believe we are positioned to deliver a highly competitive cost structure in 2008. ", "Now I want to share with you our thoughts for 2008.  ", "The beginning of 2008 is looking a lot like the beginning of 2007, with excess supply pressuring pricing. The current uncertainties in the U.S. economy were felt in slower fourth quarter holiday sales and could well be a factor in the first quarter.  However, there are also strong catalysts for growth in 2008, particularly in mobile storage and in our international sales. ", "Flash has become a key ingredient in the mobile consumer revolution and this should continue to fuel rapid growth in demand for our products in the coming years. The booming global mobile handset market has become our number one driver for growth in 2008 and beyond. This market is young and healthy and we believe that it has the capacity to soak up a disproportionately large percentage of the new Flash capacity coming on stream in 2008.  ", "International sales already account for the majority of our sales and we expect international growth in 2008 to outpace the U.S. growth, with Asia-Pacific getting an extra boost from the Summer Olympics. ", "Our OEM revenues have become a significant revenue contributor and demand in this channel appears healthy for 2008. ", "On the supply outlook, some of the factors that weighed on 2008 are fading -- sorry, weighed on 2007 are fading in 2008. For example, 200-millimeter fab capacity is becoming far less relevant and DRAM to NAND capacity conversions are impractical for the forty x -- that\u2019s x being anywhere from 41-nanometer to 48-nanometer -- NAND technology generation. ", "In 2008 the major suppliers are counting on technology transitions to 4x nanometer NAND MLC. This technology node is expected to be more challenging than previous generations and this may slow down the rate of industry-wide capacity additions in the second-half of 2008. ", "Current NAND MLC component pricing is aggressive and this is dragging down industry-wide profitability. Notwithstanding continuing cost reductions, margin pressures will persist until industry-wide demand comes into balance with supply, which we currently expect will occur later in 2008. ", "For ourselves, we expect our captive supply, including the ramping output from Fab 4, to be insufficient to meet our customers\u2019 projected demand in the second half, which will require us to continue supplementing with non-captive purchases. ", "At our coming annual analyst conference on February 25th, we plan to discuss our business in more detail. For now, I can say that the 2008 guidance that you will hear today from Judy reflects our current near-term caution given the broader economic uncertainties.  ", "Although we are tightening our spending growth, we plan to continue to invest for the long-term in strategic technology, innovative products, new markets, and our brand.  We are managing for the-long term, and aim to emerge stronger relative to competition. We believe our opportunity for the future is huge and we remain optimistic and energized.   ", "I will now turn it over to Sanjay.  ", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Thank you, Eli. Good afternoon, everyone. Mobile business was SanDisk\u2019s highlight of 2007 and our largest revenue generator by end market. Accounting for 35% of our total revenue, mobile product unit sales more than doubled year-over-year, led by continued strength in our microSD cards in the retail and OEM channels.  ", "In addition, the average capacity of our mobile cards nearly doubled due to increasing storage requirements in mobile phones and we began shipments of our high capacity 8-gigabyte microSD and 8-gigabyte Memory Stick Micro M2 mobile cards. In Q4 alone, we sold a record 51 million mobile units. ", "Unit sales of our imaging cards grew nicely in 2007, in part due to resurgence in the digital camera market and our high-performance Extreme and Ultra card unit sales nearly doubled year-over-year. ", "We made substantial gains in the portable navigation device market as sales of iNAND, our embedded flash product line, grew significantly in the fourth quarter. In our audio/video business, our strategy of focusing on the sub-$100 price range was successful, as we saw strong unit sales of Sansa Clip MP3 players during the holiday season.", " ", "On the SSD front, we continue to see this as a major new growth market for us in future years. I am pleased to announce that HP will include our 16-gigabyte SSDs in the dc7800 line of business desktop personal computers.  HP also has indicated that it expects to incorporate higher capacity SSDs in the future.  The significance of this design win is that it represents early adoption of SSD for local storage in business desktop applications working in tandem with corporate central servers. The benefits are significant power savings, faster boot-up, and immunity from disk crashes. ", "As for our internal development of MLC based SSD, we have shifted our efforts to the 43-nanometer technology since the 56-nanometer technology node will be retired from production in early 2009.  We now expect to sample 43-nanometer MLC SSD products late in 2008. ", "Our international growth strategy began to pay off in 2007.  In EMEA, we outgrew the market in both cards and USB drives and our combined retail market share in that region grew by about 4 percentage points year-over-year through November. ", "In the highly-fragmented APAC market, our market share continued to grow throughout 2007 and we currently hold the number one retail market share for cards and USB drives combined, according to GFK, an independent market research firm. ", "In Japan, we grew our share and achieved a clear number one position against entrenched competitors.  Our strategy of gaining new international customers on a country-by-country basis worked well in 2007 and this will remain a priority for us in 2008. ", "In the fourth quarter, we implemented product focused advertising campaigns.  For example, we initiated a \u201cGo Take Pictures\u201d campaign for our imaging products in select U.S. markets and in the U.K., France, and Germany. We also kicked off a \u201cWake Up Your Phone\u201d campaign to educate consumers about what they can do with a SanDisk mobile card in their phones. Targeted initiatives such as the Ducati campaign and TV advertising for the Sansa Shaker reflect our commitment to further enhance the SanDisk brand. ", "From technology and operations standpoint, we achieved consistent excellent yields on our 56-nanometer manufacturing technology and Fab 4 continued to ramp well. ", "During the quarter, our overall cost declines exceeded ASP declines on a per megabyte basis with 56-nanometer production exceeding two-thirds of our quarterly bit production. We are on track to begin the production of 3 bits per cell on 56-nanometer in the March/April timeframe and 43-nanometer 2 bits per cell technology in the Q2 time frame. Ramping these technologies will be a major focus in 2008 as we continue to drive aggressive memory manufacturing cost reductions. ", "Furthermore, we effectively leveraged our Shanghai assembly and test factory for developing industry leading nine die stack assembly technology which we utilized to build our 8-gigabyte microSD and 8-gigabyte Memory Stick Micro cards. ", "As Eli mentioned earlier, tremendous growth lies ahead for SanDisk in the mobile market. Furthermore, there are other new exciting opportunities as well such as SSDs, new media players, smart Cruzer drives, and video storage in an increasing number of digital cameras and flash-based digital camcorders. These will be huge drivers of demand for high-capacity flash storage. The team at SanDisk is focused on maximizing our opportunity in these markets and growing our business profitably in 2008 and beyond. ", "I will now turn the call to Judy.  ", "Judy Bruner", "Thank you, Sanjay and Eli, and good afternoon, everyone. Our performance in Q4 demonstrated continued improvement in gross margin and operating margin, delivering a respectable 2007 with 20% revenue growth and 13% non-GAAP operating margin.", "Our fourth quarter revenue performance of $1.25 billion was in line with our expectations, although it reflected lower price decline and lower megabyte growth than we had forecasted.  The lower sequential price decline of 11% was primarily the result of deferred pricing actions in U.S. retail and a favorable mix of product sales. ", "A larger percentage of our sales came from products that carry a higher than average ASP per megabyte, such as high performance cards. We believe our sequential megabyte growth of 37%, below the 45-60% guidance we provided last quarter, was primarily the result of weak U.S. consumer spending during the holiday period and somewhat tight supply in the first half of the quarter, which limited our ability to meet demand for some customers.", "   ", "Overall, our Q4 retail revenue was $727 million or 65% of our product revenue. Q4 retail revenue grew 20% sequentially and 2% compared to Q4 of 2006.  The year-over-year retail growth of 2% stems from a steep annual decline in ASP per megabyte coupled with weaker than normal year-over-year growth in U.S. unit sales, offset by very strong international unit sales growth.  ", "On a year-over-year basis, fourth quarter U.S. retail revenue was down 13% and international retail revenue was up 32%. ", "Our fourth quarter OEM revenue of $391 million grew 26% sequentially driven by microSD and iNand products sold to mobile handset vendors. We also saw nice sequential growth in the GPS market and in the industrial market.  ", "Compared to the fourth quarter of 2006, OEM revenue grew 7%, with strong growth in the Mobile market partially offset by our decision to de-emphasize sales of white label USB drives and exit the Twinsys joint venture. ", "For the full year of 2007, our revenue grew 20%, with product revenue up 18% and license and royalty revenue up 36%.  Product revenue for the year reflected unit growth of 75%, megabyte growth of 190% and ASP per megabyte decline of 60%. ", "Our 2007 retail revenue grew 9% over 2006, with very robust international retail growth offsetting a slight decline in North America retail revenue.  Our OEM revenue for the full year 2007 grew by 33% over 2006.", " ", "License and royalty revenue for the fourth quarter of $128 million was higher than we had projected primarily due to higher than forecasted licensee pricing in the third quarter. For the full year, our license and royalty revenue of $450 million was 12% of our total revenue, increasing from 10% of revenue in 2006, largely due to the addition of a new licensee.", " ", "Q4 non-GAAP product gross margin improved to 29.7% from 26.4% in Q3.  This improvement was driven by an increased proportion of 56-nanometer memory in our revenue and relatively modest price decline, partially offset by higher Fab 4 startup costs. Our shipments for Q4 and for the full year included approximately 5% non-captive memory.", " ", "Non-GAAP operating expenses of $237 million were up $39 million sequentially with $34 million of the increase in sales and marketing, primarily due to seasonal advertising and merchandising.", "   ", "Non-GAAP operating income for Q4 of $223 million was up 37% from the third quarter and at 17.9% of revenue was well within our 15-20% target financial model.  ", "For the full year 2007, non-GAAP operating income was $507 million, or 13% of revenue. While operating income was lower in 2007 than in 2006, we believe we performed well in a year of 60% price decline, continuing to invest in technology, products and channel footprint, and we believe we improved our competitive position.", " ", "Our Other Income for Q4 was $18 million, which is net of a $10 million impairment charge for the estimated cost to SanDisk of winding down our investment in the 200-millimeter FlashVision joint venture. This reflects our expectation that we will receive less than our investment book value as we close out our position in FlashVision.", "  ", "Our non-GAAP tax rate was 32.9% for Q4 and 34.2% for the year, bringing non-GAAP EPS to $0.69 for Q4 and $1.73 for 2007.", " ", "On the balance sheet, cash and short and long-term investments decreased sequentially by $334 million to a total of $2.9 billion.  Cash flow from operations was a positive $149 million for Q4, and was offset by investments of $202 million in repurchasing our shares, $203 million in Fab 3 and Fab 4, and $79 million in capital equipment.  For the full year, we are pleased that our cash flow from operations was $653 million, up from $598 million in 2006.", "   ", "Accounts receivable and inventory both increased sequentially very slightly in dollars, and both came down in terms of days of sales. Accounts receivable ended the year at 38 days of sales and inventory was 64 days.  Channel inventory ended the year at six weeks, the same level that existed at the end of 2006.", " ", "In summary, for 2007, it was clearly a challenging year for SanDisk but we believe that we executed very well, staying the course on our strategic investments in technology, products, and geographic expansion, while at the same time proactively reducing expenses when necessary.  I believe our balanced financial management contributed to improving our competitive position in terms of both market share and cost advantage. ", "As we enter 2008, there are similarities to early 2007 in terms of the NAND supply/demand balance and the impact this has on pricing and at the same time, the macroeconomic environment is uncertain.  ", "As a result, we are cautious in our outlook; however, we believe that we can use these challenging times to our advantage as we did in 2007 and we are focused on delivering 2008 performance that is an improvement over 2007. ", "I\u2019ll start with our outlook for the first quarter and then provide a summary for the year. We are forecasting first quarter total revenue, including both product revenue and license and royalty revenue, to be between $775 million and $875 million, compared to the $786 million reported in the first quarter of 2007, which included $53 million from the consolidation of the Twinsys joint venture.  ", "This Q1 revenue estimate reflects a sequential decline similar to the decline experienced last year. ", "Within this total revenue, we expect license and royalty revenue to be between $115 million and $125 million.  ", "We expect product revenue to reflect fairly aggressive first quarter price declines and a sequential decline in megabytes sold.", " ", "We expect first quarter non-GAAP product gross margin to be in the range of 23% to 26%, with price declines and lower volumes being partially mitigated by continued expansion of 56-nanometer memory mix.  ", "Non-GAAP operating expenses are forecasted at $215 to $220 million in Q1 and interest income is forecasted to be approximately $25 million. We forecast our non-GAAP tax rate for 2008 at approximately 34%. ", "Q1 charges to our GAAP results for stock compensation and amortization of acquisition related intangibles are expected to be similar to the Q4 levels. ", "On the balance sheet, we expect inventory dollars to increase and Q1 investments in the Flash joint ventures to be less than $50 million.  ", "Now I\u2019ll provide a few comments on the full year 2008. We are currently forecasting total revenue growth of 15% to 25%.

", "Vijay Rakesh - Oppenheimer", "Just a couple of questions on the quarter. You had said in your press release that eight companies have signed up for the cross-license agreements. I just want to get a little bit more color on how that\u2019s going and who they are. ", "Dr. Eli Harari", "We have eight companies so far signing. We are in serious negotiations with a number of other of the companies that have been cited by us. I think we made one press announcement concerning the cross-license that we signed with PNY. We have not made separate announcements for the other cross-licenses that were signed. ", "Vijay Rakesh - Oppenheimer", "And do you think this will be -- these will be multi-year agreements, right?", "Dr. Eli Harari", "Yes, these are multi-year agreements. ", "Vijay Rakesh - Oppenheimer", "Okay, that\u2019s good. And going back to the 43-nanometer and the X3, do you think 43-nanometer could get to 10% of your output by Q3, since you are already starting it in -- or late Q2, let\u2019s say?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "The 40-nanometer production output will start in the Q2 timeframe and in terms of the ramp up of bit production output, it will follow a similar ramp as 56-nanometer technology did in 2007. So in the Q3 timeframe, it will be more than 10% and will continue to increase in Q4 as well. ", "Vijay Rakesh - Oppenheimer", "Got it. So somewhere in the 10%, 15% in Q3 and probably going higher in Q4 is the way to look at it?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "You know, as I said, we expect it to be similar to 56-nanometer ramp-up during 2007. 56-nanometer output in Q4 was about two-thirds of our bit production. 43-nanometer will be about the same in Q4 2008 timeframe. ", "Vijay Rakesh - Oppenheimer", "Okay. Thanks for the clarity. On X3, how should we be looking at that?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "The majority of our bit production in 2008, a vast majority of that will be 43-nanometer, will be two bit per cell technology. I take that back -- I didn\u2019t mean to say 43-nanometer. I meant to say it will be two bit per cell technology in terms of bit production in 2008. ", "And with respect to three bit per cell, as we have said before, we have that product in 56-nanometer. We will start that production output in the March/April timeframe. Since 43-nanometer two bit per cell technology is lower cost than 56-nanometer three bit per cell, the vast majority of our output in 2008 will remain two bit per cell. ", "So three bit per cell will constitute a relatively small percentage of our output in 2008. But in 2009 timeframe, we\u2019ll be applying three bit per cell technology to 43-nanometer and that\u2019s when we expect to significantly increase three bit per cell contribution to our total bit output. ", "Vijay Rakesh - Oppenheimer", "Okay. One last question -- you said your captive supply of Fab 4 was insufficient to meet demand. Do you think non-captive mix goes back to 15%, 20% in \u201908 or do you think you will still keep it in the 10%, under range in 2008? That should be it. ", "Judy Bruner", "Actually, I said in my prepared remarks that we\u2019re assuming that we\u2019ll be about 5% to 10% non-captive in 2008. ", "Vijay Rakesh - Oppenheimer", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys. Good quarter. ", "Lori Barker Padon", "Thanks. Next question, please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Paul Coster with J.P. Morgan. ", "Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan", "Can you just help us understand what lead indicators you are looking at to underpin your guidance? You mentioned for instance the six weeks of channel inventory. That doesn\u2019t sound very excessive. Many of us would be looking at some of the wholesale NAND prices. They don\u2019t look like they are deteriorating rapidly at this instance, so what is it that you are seeing that is causing you to be so conservative about the first half guidance?", "Judy Bruner", "Paul, actually our guidance for revenue in the first quarter, if you compare it to the fourth quarter, is a similar type of Q4 to Q1 decline as we experienced last year but some of the leading indicators or indicators that we look at are of course we look at sell-through data. We get weekly sell-through data from all of our key customers around the world and we look at the pricing environment in terms of competitive pricing in the marketplace. So those are the key things that we look at. ", "Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan", "Do you think that NAND based memory has just kind of run out of steam or is this truly something to do with people\u2019s pocketbooks? Can you just sort of help us understand what\u2019s behind this?", "Dr. Eli Harari", "I\u2019m sorry, Paul. What are you saying, NAND has run out of steam?", "Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan", "Well, I\u2019m sure that you don\u2019t agree with that but what I\u2019m trying to figure out is why are things slowing down? Is it because the consumer is just not turning up in retail at all, or are they turning to other products? What is going on there, do you think? ", "Judy Bruner", "We think there is some caution right now in terms of consumer buying habits in the marketplace and that has contributed to our guidance for the first quarter. But again, the overall decline from Q4 to Q1 in our guidance is similar to the decline Q4 to Q1 last year. ", "Dr. Eli Harari", "Let me say the average price of our products now is well within the discretionary spending abilities of the U.S. and EMEA consumers, so that\u2019s not the issue. Now, if people don\u2019t show up to the store to buy the big screen television, yeah that will impact the purchases of memory cards. But I think there is certainly uncertainty here in the U.S. market. We have not seen any signs so far of leakage into EMEA or Asia-Pacific. We do think there will be a pick-up from Asia-Pacific for the Olympics, and we think that this is -- you know, there is uncertainty. People don\u2019t know about the package, the [inaudible] package. Hopefully that will start getting back consumers coming back into the market. ", "But overall, we think that there are healthy markets out there. The cell-phone market is a global market and the demand there continues strong. We think that we have a tremendous upside in international markets as far as market share. The OEM business is very healthy. ", "So overall -- and you know, price elasticity eventually kicks in. Pricing now is extremely attractive and I think people are going to start moving to the 2- and 4-gigabyte capacity. And in fact phone applications, video applications, as well as music driving the capacity requirements to the 4-, 8-, and 16-gigabyte. ", "Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, my last question -- are you still supply constrained going into this first quarter?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "At this point, we are not supply constrained in the first quarter. During the first half of Q4, we had certain supply constraints. We resolved those in the second half and we are for Q1 in reasonable balance with respect to our demand requirements, and the supply that we have to supply to that demand. ", "Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Harlan Sur with Morgan Stanley. ", "Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you. Good afternoon. Just curious, on the 43-nanometer technology, I know that you are going to start to ramp in Q2 but I\u2019m just wanting to know where are yields and are defect densities now relative to your targets?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Our results on 43-nanometer at this stage look pretty encouraging but as always, as you ramp up production, that\u2019s when you really find out all the issues and we are at this point on plan with our expectations for 43-nanometer technology. ", "Dr. Eli Harari", "I\u2019d say one other thing, a very important factor, and that is that we, together with Toshiba, decided to move to immersion lithography at the 56-nanometer technology. A number of our competitors have basically pushed non-immersion lithography -- dry lithography, if you will -- as far as they could. We made the transition at the 56-nanometer. We have very high volume experience with that. ", "So the move to 43-nanometer at least in that regard, we have I believe significantly more experience than the competition. ", "Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley", "Very good to hear. And then on the retail side, card capacity grew about 60% in \u201907. I\u2019m just wondering how much you expect that to increase here in 2008. ", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "The card capacities in general continue to increase nicely and we would expect in our mobile market the card capacities on the retail side to get in somewhat in excess of 2-gigabyte. The OEM capacity as well on the mobile front will continue to increase nicely, and on the imaging side, particularly with video continuing to increase, will also continue to drive elasticity and drive the demand, resulting in average capacity increases. ", "So all in all, the average capacities, roughly speaking, I mean in the range of 80% to 100% increase year over year. ", "Dr. Eli Harari", "I\u2019d like to add one other point here. In handsets, unlike, for example, digital cameras -- in digital cameras in the early days, digital camera manufacturers limited the bundled card capacity to the minimum that they could get away with, knowing full well that people would buy additional cards when they buy the camera. In mobile phones, multimedia cell phones, we are seeing a different trend, in that the bundled cards or the bundled embedded, in order to enable a music function really has to compete with an iPhone 8-gigabyte like baseline and we see that driving both the bundled cards moving up quite rapidly and the embedded moving up to 8- and 16-gigabytes. ", "Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley", "And my final question, you\u2019ve done a great job in terms of market share. I know two specific geographical markets you\u2019re focused on this year are Eastern Europe and Latin America. The question is for the team, what are you doing in those markets to increase penetration rate and market share?", "Dr. Eli Harari", "To increase our penetration rate and market share in these markets, we are basically really protecting it from multiple fronts. We have expanded our distribution network. We have more feet on the ground, more sales people. Of course, in certain cases, having products that are tailored toward the local needs of the regions, as well as really doing some targeted advertising and marketing to grow our share. ", "And of course, as the output from our captive factories increases, it gives us increasing capability to supply the needs for the demand for our products on a global basis. ", "Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you very much. ", "Lori Barker Padon", "Next question, please. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Krishna Shankar with JMP Securities. ", "Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities", "Can you give us a sense how you see the adoption of SSDs rolling out through 2008, please?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We are very excited about the opportunities that SSD presents to us and just today earlier in the call, we mentioned that the HP enterprise desktop computer will have solid state disk drives as well, so we are continuing to have momentum building up, strong design wins. We expect our business in 2008 in SSDs to increase substantially compared to 2007 and we plan to supply most of this business in 2008 with the SLC memory and as we look ahead at 2009, we plan to supply the product with MLC memory. ", "So we are excited about the opportunities and excited about the product lineup that we have for SSD products. ", "Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities", "So by 2009, would you anticipate that the SSD market could overtake the MP3 player market in terms of unit bit consumption? What do you see -- I\u2019m trying to get a sense for the ramp of this market of the demand driver versus say the iPod or the MP3 player market between \u201904 through \u201907. ", "Dr. Eli Harari", "The dynamics of the two markets are very, very different. I think it\u2019s a very good question. The potential of SSD in computing is very, very large. By 2009 we\u2019ll be into our third year, the industry will be into the third year of the adoption cycle and once we hit the right price point with MLC and with performance, I think this market could take off at a very steep trajectory. ", "The MP3 market, on the other hand, is moving towards video and a lot of that market is being subsumed in cell-phones, multimedia cell-phones. So there is a different kind of dynamics going on for the MP3 players and our direction is to focus on the MP3 players on the lower cost, which is also not pushing 64-gigabyte type densities but also driving for innovative new products that are in the pipeline right now. ", "I\u2019d say that we are very excited about both but we look at them differently. I believe eventually, let\u2019s say by 2011, the solid state disk market ought to be the number two market after handsets. Basically it will be the solid state disk that goes into the handset and the solid state disk that goes into your notebook or desktop except it will have a different plastic around them.", "Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities", "And my final question is what is your best assessment of NAND Flash capacity in terms of bit supply growth versus the demand growth for \u201908?", "Judy Bruner", "I\u2019ll take that question. So in terms of our overall bit growth in our revenue for 2008, we are expecting it to moderate from the 190% that we reported in 2007. At the same time, we expect that we will not have enough of our own production output to satisfy the demand and that we will have to increase somewhat our non-captive purchases from 2007 to 2008.

", "Craig Ellis - Citigroup", "Sanjay, first a question for you, just on the international market share front, as we look out over the course of 2008, can you give us either a quantitative or qualitative view on how significant you think the share gain can be versus what you achieved in \u201907?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "I think we built very strong momentum in 2007 and really established the network of sales distribution in pretty much all key geographies, and we want to continue to leverage that in 2008. I would expect the gains in share in 2008 to be similar to the gains that we have made in 2007. This is our target and we will work aggressively toward achieving this. ", "Craig Ellis - Citigroup", "And do you think you can pick up those gains both in Asia-Pac and in EMEA?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Yes, we will absolutely be targeting Asia-Pac as well as EMEA. In the Q4 timeframe, particularly because in the first half of the quarter, we had certain supply constraints and we were not able to really supply the full demand for our customers. That impacted somewhat our share in certain regions and with certain customers during the fourth quarter. We plan to gain that back and work aggressively toward that in Q1 and the rest of 2008. ", "", "Craig Ellis - Citigroup", "Okay, and then the second question, maybe for Judy or Eli, it\u2019s more of a higher level question; as we look at the 2008 guidance with moderating bit growth and moderating pricing, can you tell us -- and yet with better margins this year, is there a decision by the company to choose margins over revenue growth? Or is what we are seeing just a by-product of your supply availability?", "Judy Bruner", "I would say that it\u2019s primarily the result of us being fairly optimistic about our product cost reduction capability in 2008 and comparing that to our anticipated full-year price decline for 2008.", "Craig Ellis - Citigroup", "Okay, and within that then, Judy, you\u2019re assuming some mix of three bit per cell in the back half of the year as we think about product sales?", "Judy Bruner", "Yes, we are but as Sanjay described, we think the majority of our cost reduction will come from 43-nanometer two bit per cell. ", "Craig Ellis - Citigroup", "Okay, and then lastly, and this one is for you, with respect to the licensing guidance that you gave for the year, to what extent is licensing revenue from the eight companies that you\u2019ve set an agreement with and some of the potential licensees that you are working on embedded in that number or not?", "Judy Bruner", "There is some amount, however small, in terms of just initiating these licenses. There is some amount in the $450 million to $500 million guidance but it will start out relatively small in 2008 and we believe grow from there. ", "Craig Ellis - Citigroup", "So if you sign up additional companies, would that be incremental to the guidance that you\u2019ve given, Judy?", "Judy Bruner", "At this point, we can\u2019t predict exactly how many we will sign up and at what timeframe, so clearly we\u2019re looking at the eight and we\u2019re anticipating that we\u2019ll do a little bit more than that. But there could be variability in these numbers. ", "Craig Ellis - Citigroup", "Okay. Thanks and nice job on the margins. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. ", "Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs", "Just two quick things -- first, on the supply side, you referenced a couple of times during the call that the early part of \u201908 looks like the early part of \u201907, but \u201907 got resolved in large part because so much of the capacity got moved from NAND to DRAM and given how bad DRAM is right now, it doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s a very likely outlet for some of the supply. ", "So how do you really think the supply side and in turn the pricing gets fixed and we find the supply demand balance, given that we\u2019re not going to have the outlet of all the NAND capacity over to DRAM?", "Dr. Eli Harari", "I\u2019m not sure that I would characterize what happened in 2007 the way you did. I think that the pricing at the beginning of 2007 was reflective of inventory liquidation and became very difficult for some of the component manufacturers. And I think the same applies today. ", "But there\u2019s no question that DRAM to NAND transitions now, either way, is fading as a major factor. I think that the situation for us at SanDisk is not necessarily the same as the situation for the other Flash manufacturers that are primarily component suppliers. Although we are definitely not immune from the pricing in the commodity market, we do have the ability through going up the food chain and selling end products through our own channels, give us the ability to differentiate and retain some of the margin. ", "And I think that a very good example of that was in fact fourth quarter where most of the component suppliers reported very severe margin pressure and we actually are very pleased with our gross margin in the fourth quarter. ", "I said in my prepared remarks that there\u2019s no way that the industry can recover until there is a good balance between demand and supply. We understand the supply side coming on stream. We believe it will be less aggressive in terms of percentage growth than the industry as a whole had in 2007 and we think that the demand side will respond to the current pricing and this is a self-corrected type of situation. ", "But for our own outlook, I think that we do not intend to in any way aggravate the component situation out there. As I said, we are not in the component market. If anything, we will be a buyer in that market. And therefore I think that our outlook for 2008 really is coming from our own confidence in the markets that we are creating and the demand that we see from our own customers. And that gives us confidence. That, together with very aggressive cost reductions. ", "Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs", "Okay and if I could just ask one final follow-up; anything you can share with us about an update on the Samsung royalty negotiation?", "Dr. Eli Harari", "Not at this time. There\u2019s really nothing I can report. ", "Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs", "Can you tell us if it\u2019s something that you are working on in 2008 or if you intend to let the contract go out to the term at the end of \u201909?", "Dr. Eli Harari", "I\u2019ve said in the past that I think it is in the interest of both companies to resolve this before the expiration of the current contract and I still stand by that.

", "Amit Kapur - Piper Jaffray", "A lot of my questions have been answered but maybe if you could update us in terms of the attach rates you are seeing in mobile handset applications and how you see that trending in 2008?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "With respect to attach rates, you know, it\u2019s somewhat of a tricky question because you have to look at it both from the OEM bundling side as well as on the retail side, as well as implications of embedded Flash in the handset. But probably it would be easiest for me to just walk you through an example of this for Q4 timeframe. ", "If you look at 2007, the industry wide estimate is that maybe about 500 million or so phones with card slots that have used Flash memory in one form or another, and in Q4, if you say that of that 500 million phones in 2007, maybe about 150 million phones got sold in Q4 timeframe and SanDisk sold about 51 million units in the mobile space in Q4.", "And so if you look at that and realize that SanDisk doesn\u2019t have all of the market, we have a majority share, a leading share, but if you take into account some of the other suppliers as well, my estimate would be the total products supplied into the market in Q4, our is 51 million, maybe the total is like 75 million. That puts the attach rate at this point at about 50% or so, and again that\u2019s taking into account all aspects of this, the OEM bundling, as well as the retail sales. ", "And what we have seen is that attach rates grew nicely over the course of 2007 and we would expect the same trend in 2008 -- the increases in the attach rate are expected in the 2008 timeframe as well. ", "Amit Kapur - Piper Jaffray", "Okay, so for mobile, how do you see in 2008 the mix of retail versus OEM? ", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "The [difference] actually continues to be strong in retail as well as OEM in terms of unit growth and in terms of percentage growth, retail obviously will realize a bigger percentage growth but the trend continues to be strong on OEM as well and the mix we believe on OEM as well as retail in mobile will continue to remain pretty healthy.

So how do you expect Q2 and the second half to play out in \u201908 with respect to \u201907, so that, you know, what do you think might come forth?", "Dr. Eli Harari", "You know, we\u2019ve given you guidance for Q1 and for the year as a whole. Last year, Q2 was a strong year. Really the key question for Q2 is going to be how does the consumer market respond to government actions, to an election year? These are -- typically June is a very, very strong month for consumer retail. You\u2019ve got, you know, going out of school, starting vacation. So you\u2019ll have to give us a little bit more time before we can give you visibility of that.

", "Dr. Eli Harari", "I would say also one other thing and that is that the current -- the December/January pricing are extending beyond the cost reduction efforts of the industry, and I\u2019ve said that in the past that this is a difficult situation and they have some bearing on people\u2019s ability to or desire to invest in new capacity.

", "Doug Freedman - American Technology Research ", "In the quarter, it appears that you\u2019ve clearly had less pricing pressure than the rest of the industry. Can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing from your customers and their demands on the quality of the product that you are shipping and what impact that\u2019s going to have going forward?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "In terms of the quality of the product that we ship, I assume you mean the quality as in reliability of the product?", "Doug Freedman - American Technology Research ", "Correct. ", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "And of course, our customers fully expect us to continue to ship them the highest quality product and that is always our focus here at SanDisk and we don\u2019t plan to deviate from that. ", "Doug Freedman - American Technology Research ", "I mean, if I look at -- I guess moving on, if we look at the solid state disk drive demand, that market clearly is taking a little longer than some predicted to be adopted, largely because they are stuck using SLC devices and there\u2019s a demand out there for a move to MLC but it appears as though the market is not willing to make that move just yet. And if you could offer when you think that tipping point is that people grow comfortable offering the MLC quality levels as opposed to the SLC. ", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Our MLC quality levels for all of our products are pretty high and SanDisk has really pioneered MLC for many, many years now and we have several generations of NAND expertise under our belt to allow us to bring MLC products to the market. ", "And of course, this experience of memory technology and MLC will clearly benefit us in SSD as well as is really a key differentiator I believe for us. ", "Our own MLC SSD as I said, we\u2019ll be sampling late this year. The SSD market itself, we will continue to see it well into 2008 with SLC. And MLC, yes, certainly is challenging to implement in terms of the reliability, the endurance, the performance. But we really have the wherewithal to apply that and that\u2019s what plays to our benefit, I believe, on the SLC side. ", "So again, we will absolutely make sure that the product that ships is a robust product that meets the application requirements across multiple platforms and has of course high quality that can pass the rigors of the OEM customer qualification. ", "Doug Freedman - American Technology Research ", "Okay. If we move on and talk a little bit about the mobile space, can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing from a design-in perspective as far as how many phones you are seeing internal slots versus external slots and what you are seeing there as far as the add-in market for the phone market?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "In terms of the handset market, in terms of new design-ins, clearly the slot is really the dominant part of the business so far and will continue to be the dominant part of the mobile business. Of course, it is an increased trend, especially following on the heels of the Apple iPhone, that is providing some increase in the handset models with embedded Flash. ", "So during 2008, we do expect some increased number of models of phones with embedded Flash but by and large, the card slots we believe will continue to dominate.

And related to that, do you believe that you will be outgrowing the bit growth of the industry here in 2008?", "Dr. Eli Harari", "On the 200-millimeter, I think that we -- again, Toshiba and SanDisk decided not to push 200-millimeter beyond 70-nanometer MLC and I think that was a good decision, so all of our investments have been in 300-millimeters for the last three years, really. ", "There\u2019s very little 200-millimeter capacity that we have. Judy gave you a number of the -- our impairment -- $10 million is very little, really, in the scheme of things. We will during 2008 really just use the remaining 200-millimeter capacity on 70-nanometer really for very low density parts. We have some requirements for that, particularly for multi-chip packages but other than that, it\u2019s really not a big factor. ", "What was your second question, please? ", "Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets", "On the bit growth of the industry and your comparison to whether you\u2019ll be outgrowing the industry or not?", "Judy Bruner", "Well, I think that there\u2019s a variety of third-party industry growth rate predictions out there. Most of the ones -- ", "Dr. Eli Harari", "Yeah, I have it here, so -- basically if you take a look at Gardner, iSupply, and Merrill Lynch, they are all predicting that 2008 the industry growth in bits rate of growth will be down by about -- I\u2019m just eyeing the numbers -- approximately 10% less growth rate. We have not really given a guidance on our bit growth, except it\u2019s going to be more moderate than last year. ", "Judy Bruner", "Right, but I think if you look at most of the third party estimates, they range in the neighborhood of maybe 140% to 160% growth rate is the estimate for the industry. As we said, we expect that our growth rate will moderate from the 190% that we predicted, or that we reported, excuse me, for 2007. ", "Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets", "Okay. Thanks a lot. ", "Lori Barker Padon", "It looks like we have time for one more caller. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our final question from Bob Gujavarty with Deutsche Bank. ", "Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank", "The question I had is you mentioned international is doing better than North America -- can you talk a little bit about different trends maybe? I mean, I noticed the average capacity in retail has started to -- I mean, the growth has clearly decelerated. Is that just a function of international versus North America, or could you give us flavor of the different trends?", "Dr. Eli Harari", "International has one thing -- a much more advanced market for handsets than the United States, particularly multimedia handsets. If you go in London or Paris, you see very, very many phone wearers actually use it as their MP3 player. Now, in addition to that, Europe is really booming in many countries. We hear always about England and France but there\u2019s -- Russia is booming, Poland is booming, Scandinavia a big part of that, and of course the Middle East, at least the Middle East that\u2019s producing oil, not counting some of the trouble areas. ", "We see very, very strong demand for our products and it\u2019s just a question of having enough people, enough distribution, enough sales people to grow and nurture that demand. ", "Japan, we have really broke through in 2007. We\u2019ve gone from about 10% market share in Japan to close to 30%. That\u2019s a very competitive market and we\u2019ve had to really take share from Matsushita, Panasonic, Sony -- you know, highly entrenched suppliers. And I think that we are on a real roll in Japan. ", "Asia-Pac is very, very price competitive and there it\u2019s just a question of market share versus margin. This is Craig Ellis\u2019 earlier question -- I think it was Craig Ellis. Anyway, so we do have flexibility on -- sometimes we frankly passed on market share if pricing is going to be unacceptable. But we have the ability now to move product around the world to areas where we can maximize our impact and our gross margin contribution. ", "Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank", "Great. Thank you. ", "Lori Barker Padon", "That was our last caller. ", "Dr. Eli Harari", "I just want to end it here -- despite the near-term caution due to the current market uncertainties, we are optimistic about 2008 and beyond. Flash storage is now pivotal to the mobile consumer revolution and we believe we are well-positioned to play a leading role in the years to come and I\u2019d like to thank everyone here for listening today.

Welcome to Western Digital's third quarter financial results for fiscal year 2008. (Operator Instructions) Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin. ", "Bob Blair", "Thank you. As we begin, I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning our opportunities and demand in the hard drive industry; customer preference for the WD brand; our capital expenditures; repurchases of our stock; our short-term investments; our cash conversion cycle; seasonality of the June quarter; and our current financial outlook for the June quarter. ", "These forward-looking statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on February 5, 2008 as well as the additional risk factors reported in the press release included as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 8-K we furnished to the SEC today. ", "We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events and you should not assume later in the quarter that the comments we make today are still valid.", "I would now like to turn the call over to John Coyne, President and Chief Executive Officer of Western Digital. ", "John F. Coyne", "Thank you, Bob. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. With me today is CFO Tim Leyden. The market for hard drives continued to demonstrate strong year-on-year unit growth of 16.2% in the March quarter, while exhibiting an 8.6% seasonal decline from the exceptionally strong December quarter, as we had anticipated in our original guidance for the third quarter issued on January 23rd.  ", "We are extremely pleased with the March quarter results we released earlier today. The WD team again delivered excellent performance, continuing our strong track record of profitable growth.  ", "Our Q3 revenue performance reflects customer preference for the WD value proposition of quality and reliability, a compelling product portfolio, and responsive and timely availability, supported by a demonstrated willingness and capability to invest in the future.  Our earnings performance is the result of healthy market demand, a competitive cost structure, disciplined financial management, and a committed team with a passion to succeed.", "Let me share some highlights of our March quarter performance compared with the same quarter last year: hard drive revenues rose by 43% to $2 billion and 22 million; hard drive unit shipments grew by 41% to 34.5 million; earnings per share expanded by 132% to $1.23; gross margins increased 680 basis points to 22.6%. ", "We continued to demonstrate financial and operational discipline, generating substantial cash from operations and maintaining our industry-leading asset velocity.  From the beginning of the quarter we focused closely on sales linearity and achieved a significant improvement in performance year-on-year.  Our sales in the final week of the quarter were 9.8% of our total quarter volume, compared with 13% in the same week a year ago.  ", "As we watched demand and supply patterns emerge throughout the quarter, we made the decision to shut down our component and drive factories for substantially all of the last week of the quarter.  We did so in order to balance our supply with demand and ensure that we created no overhang of inventory to pressure the seasonally-weak June quarter.  ", "Consequently our total inventory remained flat quarter-on-quarter at an industry leading 25 days, which included finished goods up modestly by less than one day of supply.  This supply/demand alignment action reduced gross margins in the quarter by some 60 basis points.  ", "Reflecting our confidence in the future of the hard drive industry and WD\u2019s strategy and business model, we announced a new share buyback authorization of $500 million over five years. ", "We continue to grow faster than the industry in practically all market segments we serve -- desktop, enterprise, branded and mobile.  The one exception to the WD growth story in the March quarter was our DVR business where, consistent with our January commentary, we chose to reduce our volumes in order to improve profitability in that business. ", "A key driver of our success is our focus on product quality and reliability.  During the quarter, WarrantyWeek published an analysis of five-year warranty claim trends for U.S. tech companies.  This data highlights significant and consistent improvement by WD over the last five years. ", "We have lowered the cost of warranty claims from an industry competitive 1.9% of revenues in 2003 to a clear industry leadership position of 0.9% in calendar year 2007.  At the same time, we have extended our average warranty period by some 50%. ", "While these improvements fall straight to the WD bottom line, more important is the fact that our customers also benefit substantially from the lower cost of ownership of WD drives and enhanced customer perception of systems which incorporate WD drives. ", "Earlier this week, we announced availability of the WD VelociRaptor 2.5-inch 300 gigabyte 10,000 RPM hard drive, the next generation product in our popular WD Raptor  enterprise SATA family. This is the fastest SATA drive available in the industry today, delivering a 35% performance improvement over the WD Raptor drive. ", "At 300-gigabytes, it delivers the industry\u2019s highest capacity in a 2.5-inch 10,000 RPM drive, double that currently available from competition. It incorporates the highest areal density shipping in the industry, at 290 gigabits per square inch.    ", "Our IcePack adapter allows the drive to be mounted in a 3.5-inch drive bay while reducing operating temperature some seven degrees further improving long-term reliability. ", "WD VelociRaptor continues our industry-leading GreenPower initiative launched last July by delivering all of these attributes while consuming 35% less power than the previous Raptor family. This product demonstrates the continued momentum in WD\u2019s development and deployment of leading technologies and further enhances our broad product portfolio.  ", "In summary, we are pleased with our sustained progress against our profitable growth objective year to date. We continue to feel good about the robust demand forecasted in our industry over the next several years and about WD\u2019s opportunity to continue to prosper by providing compelling solutions to customers. ", "Tim will now provide a Q3 financial report and our outlook for Q4. Tim.", "Tim Leyden", "Thank you, John. Our March results reflect strong execution by the WD team. Throughout the quarter, we leveraged our operational flexibility and financial management discipline to carefully match supply with demand. This resulted in outstanding revenue growth and operational results that delivered 680 basis points of gross margin improvement over the same quarter last year and revenue and earnings that exceeded our updated guidance. ", "A strong January and February, coupled with a measured approach to March\u2019s more competitive environment, led to better revenue linearity for WD year-on-year, enabling us to generate $431 million in operating cash flow and pay down $260 million in debt, while also repurchasing $44 million of common stock. ", "Revenue for our third fiscal quarter was $2.1 billion. This includes $89 million from external sales of media and substrates. Hard drive revenue of $2.022 billion was up 43% from the prior year and hard drive shipments totaled 34.5 million units, up 41% from the prior year period.   ", "Average hard drive selling price was approximately $59 per unit, down $2 from the December quarter and up $1 from the year-ago quarter. Product and channel mix changes as well as expected seasonal pricing factors contributed to the quarterly ASP decline. The percentage of our hard drive revenue generated by non-desktop PC applications was 54% in the March quarter, consistent with the December quarter, and it was 47% for the year-ago quarter.", "We shipped 10.2 million 2.5-inch mobile drives in the March quarter, as compared to 8.7 million in the December quarter and 3.7 million in the year-ago quarter.  These increases were driven by continued strength in overall mobile storage demand coupled with increased customer preference for WD product offerings. ", "Sales in our desktop, enterprise and branded products businesses were in line with our expectations. ", "In consumer electronics, we shipped 3.1 million 3.5-inch drives for use in digital video recorders in the March quarter versus 4.1 million in the December quarter and 2.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Our moderation of unit shipments in this market generated the desired outcome of improved margins.  We continue to believe that this market offers us long-term profitable growth opportunities.", "Hard drive channel revenue was 50% OEM, 34% distribution and 16% branded products versus 48% OEM, 34% distribution and 18% branded in the December quarter; and it was 47% OEM, 34% distribution and 19% branded in the year-ago quarter. These percentages exclude external sales of media and substrates, which totaled $89 million in the March quarter, or 4% of revenue, and $120 million in the December quarter, or 5% of revenue. As a reminder, there were no media and substrate sales in the year-ago quarter as we had not yet made the media acquisition.  ", "There was no single customer that comprised more than 10% of total revenue, reflecting a healthy diversity of customers in multiple markets.", "The Q3 geographic split of our hard drive revenue was 28% Americas, 31% Europe and 41% Asia, as compared to 32% Americas, 32% Europe and 36% Asia in the December quarter; and it was 36% Americas, 29% Europe and 35% Asia in the year-ago quarter. These percentages also exclude external sales of media and substrates.", "Our gross margin percentage for the quarter was 22.6% versus 23.3% in the December quarter and 15.8% in the year-ago quarter. The decrease in gross margin versus Q2 came from more competitive pricing, a higher OEM mix and the negative impact of our one week factory shut down, offset by increased volume and improved cost.  ", "Operating expenses totaled $179 million, or 8.5% of revenue. Total operating expense was slightly down from the December quarter. As compared to the prior year, operating expenses are up as a result of adding media operations, higher incentive compensation associated with stronger financial performance, and increased investments in new programs to support technological advancements and our broadening product portfolio.  ", "Operating income was $298 million, or 14% of revenue.", "Interest and other non-operating expenses were approximately $8 million. This includes about $3 million of unrealized losses on our previously disclosed investments in auction-rate securities. These investments totaled $30 million at the end of the quarter.   ", "Our $10 million tax provision for the March quarter is approximately 3.5% of quarterly income before taxes and the year-to-date rate is approximately 4%, excluding Q1 non-recurring items. We expect that our rate for the full year will continue to be at the low end of our previously stated 4% to 6% range. ", "Our net income totaled $280 million, or $1.23 per share. ", "In March we announced a realignment of our media operations related to the planned completion of the majority of our external media and substrate supply obligations. The total estimated cost of this realignment is about $16 million. This was recorded as an adjustment to the goodwill balance as of the end of the quarter and did not impact March\u2019s operating results. ", "We continued to make excellent progress on our media integration and are on track to meet our previously stated plans of full integration by the December quarter.   ", "Turning to the balance sheet, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter totaled $949 million as compared to $967 million at the end of December.  ", "Cash generated from operations during the quarter totaled $431 million.  ", "Capital expenditures for the quarter of $137 million were lower than our original expectation. Our non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization expense totaled $111 million. For the first nine months of 2008, our capital expenditures totaled $469 million. We now expect capital expenditures to be about $625 million for fiscal 2008, about $75 million lower than our most recent guidance as we align expenditures with anticipated demand and realized efficiency gains. Fiscal 2008 depreciation and amortization is expected to be about $410 million. ", "We reduced debt by a total of $260 million during the March quarter. We repaid the $760 million bridge loan and replaced it with a five-year credit facility that consists of a $500 million term loan, which is currently outstanding, and a currently unutilized $250 million revolving line of credit. ", "We also repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares of common stock for $44 million. Since May 2004, we have repurchased 16.6 million shares at a total cost of $248 million, for an average price of about $15 per share. Earlier this month, we announced an increase to our stock repurchase plan of $500 million. Going forward, we will weigh opportunities to repurchase our stock against other investment opportunities and prepayments of our outstanding debt as we take our typical opportunistic approach to share repurchases.", "As of the end of March, we had cash and cash equivalents of $917 million and short-term investments of $32 million, which included $30 million of auction-rate securities. These auction-rate securities are currently accounted for as current assets and are held as available for sale securities. However, if the liquidity of these securities continues to be constrained by the market, we may have to reclassify them as long-term investments.   ", "As of the end of March, we had 44 days of receivables outstanding, 25 days of inventory, or 14 turns, and 64 days of payables. This resulted in a cash conversion cycle of 5 days, which is within our stated model range of 4 to 8 days. Going forward, we expect to trend towards the high end of that range as we weigh working capital investments against opportunities for growth in new markets and opportunities to reduce shipping costs. ", "I will now discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2008.  ", "Revenue for the March quarter included $89 million from the sales of media and substrates to external customers. As we indicated previously, we will not in future be breaking out the amount of revenue generated from these external sales due to the planned reduction in these activities and the expected insignificant impact on our total revenue. ", "Historically, drive demand goes down sequentially from the March to June quarter by approximately 2% to 3%. We would normally expect natural demand reductions in this range. However, late March competitive market dynamics now lead us to forecast a reduction of 4% to 6% and competitive pricing at the high end of historical norms in the June quarter. Consequently, we are forecasting total revenues to be in the range of $1.825 billion to $1.9 billion. This represents an increase of between 34% and 39% over the prior year period.  ", "We are modeling gross margin of approximately 20%. While this is down from the March quarter, it represents a 500 basis point increase over the 15% gross margin we reported for the June quarter of 2007.  ", "Operating expenses are projected to be approximately $180 million as we continue to invest in expanding our product and technology portfolio. ", "Our net interest expense is projected to be about $5 million, assuming no further investment losses.  ", "We anticipate our tax rate to be at the low end of our previously stated range of 4% to 6% of pretax income, and our share count to be approximately flat with the March quarter.", "Accordingly, we estimate earnings per share of between $0.77 and $0.83 for the June quarter.", "Operator, we are now ready to open the call up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Steven Fox. ", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "I was wondering if you could go back over a couple of things. You mentioned how you made a decision to close production in the last week of the quarter. Could you give us some more insight to how that decision was made, on what timing? And is it possible that you would consider to do the same thing and for a longer period in the June quarter, given the demand pressures or the economic concerns that are out there? And then I had a follow-up. ", "John F. Coyne", "We, as I mentioned, we track the progress of the market and our progress in the market on a weekly basis and we make decisions on what we are seeing in those market dynamics relative to matching our supply with the demand that we anticipate, updated by those weekly pulsing of the market. And we did that through last quarter and we made appropriate decision to reduce production in order to ensure that our ending inventories were appropriate to the forward-looking demand and didn\u2019t overhand the market. ", "We will watch progress as we go through this quarter and we will align our production to the demand. ", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "Could you also talk about the decision on the capital spending plans? What does that -- how much of that is efficiency related versus more conservative demand outlook for say the next 12 months?", "John F. Coyne", "I think the demand outlook, we believe that the fundamental dynamics, the demand for storage growing at about 60% on an annual year-over-year basis in terms of petabytes of storage, serve us to buy a 40% to 45% areal density growth and a 15% plus unit growth. We believe those forecasts of demand remain intact. That\u2019s the kind of demand profile I expect as we look forward. We believe that the seasonality of the business is fundamentally tracking to historical norms. As you look at that long-term outlook, the primary influence on our deferral of capital investment was realized efficiency gains of our existing installed capacity base. ", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Sherri Scribner, you may ask your question and please state your company name. ", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "We\u2019ve heard a lot of comments from Seagate and others about aggressive pricing in the March quarter. Can you maybe give us a little more detail in terms of where you saw aggressive pricing? I think Seagate commented that they saw it on high [cap] and desktop. There were some comments that there was aggressive pricing in notebook OEM. Can you maybe give us some more detail there?", "John F. Coyne", "Well, the drive business continues to be a competitive business. We did see some greater than anticipated pricing action in late March, particularly. And as I noted, we had put a lot of emphasis with our sales force and our business teams to improve the linearity of our sales efforts through the March quarter, and we achieved that to a very large degree, shipping under 10% of our total units in the final week of the quarter. Our data from the industry would suggest that the rest of the industry shipped about 16.5% of their total units in the final week of the quarter. And we believe that that puts significant pressure on pricing as the quarter closed, leading to a start point for the current quarter that is lower than we would have liked to see. ", "However, if you -- the guidance that Tim gave a moment ago indicates that we expect to see that end of March exit influence pricing this quarter, having it trend towards the higher end of seasonal normal pricing, and we saw a little bit of a slow start influenced by the inventory overhangs that were present starting the quarter. ", "But the underlying trends quarter to date meets our expectations. ", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "I guess I wonder, is the pricing worse than what you saw last year when we had aggressive pricing in notebook, or would you say it\u2019s relatively similar? I mean, you said that it was a little bit worse than you would have expected. ", "John F. Coyne", "I think the profile is pretty much towards the high-end of the pricing activity that we see, but you have to bear in mind that the entire industry -- well, certainly WD is running 500 basis points higher on the gross margin level this year than last in terms of our guidance for the quarter. So I think the industry is in much better shape but the overall seasonality overlays an industry that is in fundamentally better shape. ", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe if I could squeak in a question about your gross margin; how much did the Komag acquisition help your gross margins this quarter and how much more do you expect to get out of the Komag acquisition as we move through the calendar year?", "Tim Leyden", "You\u2019ll recall we indicated that we had gotten 80 basis points in the December quarter. We added another 40 basis points approximately in this quarter, and that leaves us to pick -- up over the next three quarters, we have to pick up the remaining 180 basis points of the 300 basis point cost improvement that we indicated we were going to get by the end of December. ", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Mark Moskowitz, your line is open. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "A few questions, if I could, John and Tim. When you talk about the guidance as far as the ranges you gave for the industry growth and your revenue growth, how should we think about the puts and takes in terms of your unit expectations relative to that 4% to 6% decline, as well as your ASPs? Are you going to grow at or below market?", "Tim Leyden", "Actually, from an ASP viewpoint -- we don\u2019t go into units but from an ASP viewpoint, from Q3 to Q4 we see historically price declines being at the upper end of the spectrum due to seasonally lower demand and lower mix upgrades due to a higher percentage of our business going into the OEM channel, which means because it\u2019s a weaker -- it\u2019s a weaker quarter for both retail and the distribution spot market. So consequently, we would expect the ASPs to be down similar to what they have been historically. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, and then how should we think about the retail performance in the quarter? You\u2019ve enjoyed great momentum there over the past couple of years because of sound execution and a very good product reception, but I was kind of perplexed by the slowdown there sequentially. ", "John F. Coyne", "Well, I think the -- we are very happy with our continued position in the branded products area and the retail area. There is one WD specific issue in that we were transitioning from our older passport industrial design to our new offering, so we were moving from the any color you want as long as it\u2019s black to our new palette of 15 different colors and finishes, as well as segmented market functionality with products targeted at individual markets. ", "So we constrained sell-in in order to flush the existing inventories out of the retail channel. Our sell-out was robust. However, we constrained sell-in in order to clear the existing inventories before restocking with the new product line. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, so that was deliberate then -- there was no sort of issue in terms of disruption as you tried to move to that more broad-based industrial design?", "John F. Coyne", "No surprises. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, and then how should we think about that snap-back then, relative to your broader industry comments? Could you maybe have some wiggle room there where retail maybe bounces back a little better in June?", "Tim Leyden", "I think that seasonally, retail in the June quarter tends to be -- it tends to be the weakest quarter of the year for retail, so I would anticipate something similar in the June quarter. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, and then just lastly, can you maybe just talk about what you are seeing in Europe? Particularly, your Europe business I think has been really strong on the retail side and a lot of comments from some of your peers and some of the distis out there are suggesting that Europe is starting to really exhibit signs of some deterioration as saw start in the U.S. about six months ago. ", "John F. Coyne", "I think if we looked at the quarter to date pattern, Europe is a little slow out of the traps from a distribution perspective. Overall, the business is tracking exactly as on a worldwide basis -- the industry is tracking as we expect. A little stronger in OEM, a little weaker in European disti. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Rich Kugele, you may ask your question and please state your company name.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company", "Good afternoon. Two quick questions; first, on your notebook share, obviously you\u2019ve gained a fair amount in recent quarters. Have you sensed any indications from the OEMs that they are uncomfortable with that level of share that Seagate sometimes hears their enterprise business? Or do you think that any share improvements that happen at Seagate as they get more on par on areal density can come out of other people, that that doesn\u2019t necessarily have to come out of you?", "John F. Coyne", "Our current position in notebook is driven by our product portfolio, our execution relative to timely availability, and our quality and reliability demonstration, allied to our forward-looking roadmap for products in that space. So we are certainly not seeing any signs of customer resistance to that compelling value offering. ", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay, and then just lastly to follow-up on your prepared comments there on the VelociRaptor, I mean effectively, unlike the previous Raptor which had been somewhat more of a niche product accepted by the high performance community, this one really is an enterprise 2.5-inch in a 3.5-inch clothing. Can you just talk about how much of a leap it is to take this product and actually make it a 2.5-inch enterprise class SASS for example, or the next leap in technology to get it to be a pure play enterprise?", "John F. Coyne", "Well, I think as I mentioned, the product is a very significant demonstration of our continued momentum in technology deployment, offering as it does a leading areal density in the industry today. ", "You are correct; we are selling it in the 3.5-inch clothing, targeted specifically at the high performance workstation and the high energy gaming environment, where the Raptor has established a very powerful brand position for us. ", "However, as a 2.5-inch drive, it is also targeted at the blade server market in that SATA drives plug into SASS [back links]. So we expect to see some significant opportunity there. ", "As to the rest of your question, you know we never announce product until it is [shipping in bulk]. ", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Robert Marson, your line is open. Please state your company name. ", "Robert Marson ", "Good afternoon, gentlemen. Congratulations on an excellent quarter and stellar execution. The recent reports have now sort of tallied up last year\u2019s unit growth at over 500 million units and about 18% or 19% in the hard disk drive space. That\u2019s a material acceleration from the prior three or -- two or three years, anyway. Do you see unit growth maintaining a mid-teen level for your fiscal \u201909? And do you think that you guys can continue to grow market share or maintain share in the external drive business as well as the 2.5-inch business? And the reason I ask that is obviously your run-rate exiting last quarter was significantly higher than it was 12 months ago and I\u2019m just wondering if you would have any opinion as to where it might be 12 months from now. Thank you. ", "John F. Coyne", "Sure. Let me separate the two parts of that question. To the overall market, we think what we are seeing is the impact of the non-PC content driven demand for storage -- that is, last year as you said, over 500 million drives shipped against a roughly 300 million PC systems in the year, so a significant greater than 1-to-1 attach rate, drives versus PCs. ", "We believe a lot of that is being driven by rich content through the Internet, through Flash enabled small mobile devices like cameras and audio players creating significant incremental types of demand that may be hooked to a PC or may be delivered through a completely separate device, such as a DVR. ", "So we are very positive about those additions to the traditional underlying demand drivers and so we do believe that the 15%, 12% to 15% forecasts that are around are more driven by historical trend analysis than they are by that opportunity analysis of content generation. ", "So I believe the opportunity is in the 15%-plus unit growth opportunity over the next few years. ", "To your question about WD, our focus is to continue to provide the WD value proposition of high quality, higher reliability, high availability and responsiveness, a very competitive offering supported by the industry\u2019s lowest cost business model, and using our investments in technology to maintain compelling product portfolios. I think if we can keep doing that, the customers are voting that they like it. ", "Robert Marson ", "And one final point or question -- how do you sort of feel about the entire industry\u2019s profit margin structure and sustainability thereof? I know that in the last four quarters, Western Digital and Seagate have made money. Hitachi for the full trailing 12 months has struggled and the other Asian companies have either broken even or lost money. ", "When I look at -- when I try to roll up the businesses as best I can, I come to a high single, mid to high single-digit operating margin for the business. Do you feel there has been enough consolidation in addition to organic unit growth opportunities for the whole industry, so that existing pricing structures and profit margin structures can continue within the business, with Hitachi trying to become more profitable? Thank you. ", "John F. Coyne", "I think there is -- you know, when we look at consolidation, I don\u2019t think there is any compelling trigger to drive further consolidation in the industry. The way we look at the industry today, you\u2019ve got Seagate, a very large, very capable, very profitable company generating significant cash. You\u2019ve got Western Digital, a not so big, well-managed, low cost, high profit, high cash generation business. You\u2019ve got Hitachi, who seem to be finally focusing on the fundamentals of cost structure appropriate to the market opportunities available to them and driving towards a positive outcome. ", "And then the three -- Toshiba, Fujitsu, and Samsung -- essentially all dependent on the single merchant head supplier, TDK, for their products. And if you look at the financials of TDK, I think that\u2019s where you see where the value is being captured. However, Fujitsu, Toshiba, and Samsung, as well as Hitachi, being divisions of large Asian corporate owners, it appears to me that as long as they product marginally positive results on an ongoing basis, they will potentially keep being funded. ", "However, we have seen evidence over the last year-and-a-half to two years that where they deliver negative results, the parents to not have the patience to allow that to continue for extended periods. ", "Robert Marson ", "You\u2019ve made your intentions known to enter the enterprise businesses. Is there any -- and your chief competitor, Seagate, has sort of done its fair share in the consolidation movement. Is there any change you would try to purchase an enterprise drive business were it to become available?", "John F. Coyne", "We are looking at all business segments in which we currently don\u2019t participate and assessing the business cases for all of those opportunities. Our experience tells us that organic growth has been the thing that has generated the best results for us. As we\u2019ve watched the outcomes of other people\u2019s horizontal acquisitions at the drive level, while we have focused on vertical acquisitions at the component level and so we don\u2019t currently have any designs on anything other than growing into segments in which we don\u2019t participate where we can close a business case to generate profitable growth from that activity. ", "Robert Marson ", "Thank you very much and congratulations on an excellent quarter. You don\u2019t have a lot of sponsorship on the street, so you won\u2019t get a lot of congratulations on the call, so I guess I need to do two or three of them. Again, congratulations. ", "Operator", "Mark Miller, you may ask your question and please state your company name.", "Mark Miller - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.", "I would certainly like to add my sentiment to the last gentlemen and also agree with his ponderance of why you are not getting more support on the street after an exceptional quarter. I just have a couple of questions. One is the mobile -- you\u2019ve grown very strongly in the mobile units. How are the margins doing there? Are you getting better margins with this growth? Are you maintaining margins?", "Tim Leyden", "We\u2019ve been very cost competitive in our mobile product lineup and once again I can reaffirm that our margin hierarchy is still intact, which is enterprise, branded products, mobile, desktop, and DVR or CE. ", "Mark Miller - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.", "My second question is are you able to translate your technology leadership in the 3.5 space into share gain at the high end? Are you seeing any share gains at the high end, the higher capacity points?", "John F. Coyne", "In 3.5?", "Mark Miller - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.", "In 3.5.", "John F. Coyne", "We\u2019ve chosen to deploy our technology first at the volume end of the 3.5-inch market, so we deployed first on our single SATA products and we are moving that technology across the broad range of our overall product line. That\u2019s the strategy that appeared to us to generate the optimal impact on our bottom line, and that deployment across full product range is going very well. ", "Mark Miller - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "David Bailey, you may ask your question. Please state your company name. ", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on where you are seeing the most pricing, either by segment or product area. ", "John F. Coyne", "I think we\u2019ve seen most -- I mean, most of the pricing movement has been in the high cap desktop arena. We\u2019ve seen also some pricing activity as more folks have come into the current technology deployment in the 2.5-inch space, so as people have showed up with more cost effective 160s and with 250s and now beginning to see some 320 volumes coming into the market, that\u2019s having an impact on the high-end pricing of the 2.5-inch space as well. ", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "Great, and could you tell us where you think channel inventory is at this point?", "Tim Leyden", "Channel inventory is in the normal four to six week range, although as Seagate indicated, it is at the higher end of that metric. ", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "And where are you, do you think?", "Tim Leyden", "We are within our normal four to six week range. ", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Aaron Rakers, your line is open. Please state your company name. ", "Aaron Rakers - Wachovia ", "Thank you for taking the question. I guess I want to dig a little bit more into the gross margin line. If we think about your positioning over the last few quarters in the high capacity notebook market and we think about the competitive landscape going forward, how much has that been a contributor to the gross margin trend? And how should we think about that going forward, as you just mentioned that pricing is starting to look a little bit more aggressive there?", "Tim Leyden", "Well, in the notebooks specifically, as I indicated to a prior questioner, we\u2019ve got the very cost effective platform and we have benefited from a higher mix, as you indicate. And we have seen more competition in the March quarter at the 250-gigabyte capacity point and at the higher-end, so we do anticipate that there will be a more balanced competitive environment in that going forward. ", "But again, our most sustainable advantage is our cost competitiveness and we feel pretty comfortable that we would be able to deal with the competitive situation as it arises. ", "Aaron Rakers - Wachovia ", "And when I look at your geographical mix in this last quarter, it looks like North America was down quite a bit on a sequential basis, as well as Europe. Can you give us an idea of what you are seeing in terms of just demand from a geographical perspective?", "Tim Leyden", "From a geographical point of view, the primary factor in the shift from North America to Japan is primarily in the increase in our -- sorry, to Asia is the increase in our notebook shipments, because most of the OEMs and delivery points are in Asia for notebook. We are seeing North America with normal -- what we would consider normal demand, albeit a little bit softer in North America versus Latin America. ", "Aaron Rakers - Wachovia ", "Okay, and then final question for me is when we again look at the retail business, I can understand the transition from a product line perspective, but are you starting to see competition become more effective in that market, i.e. through competitive solutions or just through the breadth of their own channels?", "Tim Leyden", "No. ", "Aaron Rakers - Wachovia ", "Fair enough. Thank you.", "Operator", "Jeff Brickman, you may ask your question and please state your company name. ", "Jeff Brickman - CVS", "Just a couple quick questions; just on the R&D side of things, you guys have been absolutely pretty incredible at staying at kind of the leading edge technologically and yet you have less than half the R&D spend of some of your competition. I\u2019m just wanting to kind of understand longer term -- do you think that you can continue to do that or maybe should we expect you to kind of go back to the model that you had more a couple of quarters ago and historically where you look to spend a little bit less and then go after markets as they mature?", "John F. Coyne", "I think we have guided that the long-term expectation is that we will be in the 9% to 10% range on OpEx, of which R&D is a large component. But we will continually strive to be highly efficient in the leverage we get out of that dollar spending. ", "Jeff Brickman - CVS", "Okay, thanks. And just on -- just one other question, just on notebooks, and I know it\u2019s been kind of asked a couple of different ways but as you look at the market now and you clearly have a bit of a technological advantage. It sounds like a lot of customers, particularly OEMs, are looking to really get your product when and where they can. How do you kind of weigh your relative position versus the potential for price aggression? Do you think you can combat some of it by just obviously having a bit of an advantage there? Or is this going to be a scenario kind of like we saw in high cap last year where there\u2019s basically enough parity or at the very least, people can kind of stack stuff together to be aggressive?", "John F. Coyne", "Well as Tim said, our focus is -- on the cost side, we have a very high focus on designing for cost and then executing for low cost. And I think that\u2019s a differentiator in that when we addressed the 2.5-inch market five years ago and put our plans together and began to design product, we fast forwarded to the present day where we are rapidly approaching the point where the volumes of 2.5 are going to cross over the volumes of 3.5. And so it\u2019s a -- when we sat down to go look at that business, we said it was going to be a high volume business of similar scale to desktop and therefore that the cost profiles would be similar. And we set out to design a solution to that and we\u2019ve achieved that. ", "I think some of the incumbents, some of the more traditional suppliers of 2.5-inch drives are lumbered by a fundamental design approach that does not acknowledge those kind of market requirements. And consequently, they have a fundamental cost penalty in attempting to address that market. And I think our customers clearly recognize the quality and reliability has not been compromised by our approach. We are delivering the technology. We are delivering the product capacities and performance levels they want and we are doing that with a very solid credible forward roadmap and manufacturing and supply chain structure that they have confidence will deliver the values that they need over time. ", "Jeff Brickman - CVS", "Great. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "[Yun Pak], your line is open.  ", "Yun Pak - BMO Capital Markets ", "I want to ask about your share repurchase program. Over the last few years, you guys have purchased about $50 million worth of shares. And with your new share authorization, I was wondering if you are going to ramp that up to about $100 million for the duration of the program, or how aggressive will you guys be?", "Tim Leyden", "Well, as I indicated in my remarks earlier, we will weigh the repurchase opportunities against investment opportunities in other areas, and we will look at repayment of outstanding debt. We haven\u2019t placed any constraints on our potential behavior there, so we are taking an opportunistic approach and where we see that the stock is undervalued and that it is a very good investment, we will take advantage of that as we see the opportunities arise. ", "Yun Pak - BMO Capital Markets ", "Okay and one other question on your CapEx, the $75 million cut, can you talk about where, what parts of your business are you guys cutting in terms of capital investment?", "Tim Leyden", "As John indicated, it\u2019s basically better equipment utilization in drives and components right across the business, and that\u2019s effectively what is driving that and just managing it as we always do in a  just-in-time basis, adding capacity just in time as we need it. ", "Yun Pak - BMO Capital Markets ", "Are you guys investing less in media heads or drive assembly equipment and testing?", "Tim Leyden", "Again, I mean, it\u2019s right across the entire business. ", "Yun Pak - BMO Capital Markets ", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Christian Schwab, your line is open. Please state your company name. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital", "My quick question was regarding finished goods inventory. It kind of appears that the industry is in a similar situation we were in in 2004. Thankfully we only have one guy with a very bloated inventory; we don\u2019t have Maxtor with it as well. But it appears if one wanted to be an optimist, that both you and Seagate\u2019s management may realize that given the significant decline in earnings on a sequential basis you are predicting, Seagate down 40% and yourselves down 35%, do you believe that that ultimately you hope is a conservative rock bottom number, or are you fearful that the environment is a lot worse than that, if you can recall that a few years ago?", "Tim Leyden", "Rock bottom number -- I don\u2019t know how to answer that one because I really can\u2019t predict but from an inventory viewpoint, manufacturers inventory, we were at seven days at the end of Q2. We are at eight days at the end of Q3, and the rest of the industry was at 10 days at the end of Q2 and was at 15 days at the end of Q3. ", "Addressing your 40% down quarter on quarter, I think that that\u2019s a bit -- it doesn\u2019t take into account the actual increase that we\u2019ve seen versus this quarter last year, which is 500 basis points. And as well as that, the seasonality, which is generally from Q3 to Q4, has been down. And last year our EPS was $0.38, so we are forecasting between $0.77 and $0.83. If you don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good increase, I don\u2019t know how I can help you. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital", "Do you guys still calculate distribution inventory on a 13-week rolling average versus Seagate at a four-week rolling average?", "Tim Leyden", "We never did it on a 13-week rolling average. Seagate has done it at a 13-week rolling average previously, but this quarter I think that they actually changed that metric. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital", "Great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Scott Craig. ", "Scott Craig - Banc of America ", "Just two quick questions here; first on the DVR side, is there more opportunity to improve the profitability there and is it necessary to walk away from business and maybe grow slower than the market in order to achieve that, or are there other ways you can achieve it?", "And then secondly, another question on inventory; from an inventory perspective, I guess the one thing that some people are concerned about is everyone in the industry is pointing to sort of normal channel inventory levels, normal levels in general and yet we saw a pretty sharp drop-off in demand in the last part of March. So how do you guys triangulate being \u201cnormal\u201d inventory levels when demand seems to be falling off a bit here? One would think that the whole industry should take actions like you guys did and close shop for a week or two and really bring inventory levels down, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be occurring widespread. So I\u2019m just curious on your thoughts there. Thanks. ", "John F. Coyne", "Let me address the DVR market. I think we\u2019ve made some pretty good progress in our, in the actions that we took last quarter to manage that market and that opportunity and those -- that\u2019s managing product mix, customer mix, and cost. And we are working all of those things and as Tim said in his remarks, I mean, we think this is a very good opportunity area for us to generate profitable growth on a go-forward basis. ", "Inventory, Tim, do you want to address that, or -- ", "Tim Leyden", "I do think that the inventory should be managed according to the demand. And I mean, we do have the tools available with the weekly reporting, which happens. So we would be happy if others decide the same sort of discipline in that particular [inaudible] also. ", "John F. Coyne", "But I think to put things in perspective, you referenced the 2004 situation where the level of inventory build was 2X the current build in terms of percentage of inventory relative to industry sales. So I think we have a little overhang. I think it has reflected itself in a little slower distribution start this quarter. ", "We don\u2019t actually from the data see that there was any significant reduction in demand in the back half of March. The data indicates that demand was steady. I think the fact that Western Digital's linearity sales was very good left some of our competitors with a bit of a hill to climb in the back-half of March. ", "Bob Blair", "Is there one more question?", "Operator", "Robert Marson, your line is open. ", "Robert Marson ", "Thanks for the follow-up. Do you guys know where your products are ending up on a geographical basis? And the reason I ask that is because there is this global infrastructure boom going on in BRIC and other parts of the world -- Brazil, Russia, India, China area and the Middle East, Latin America. Is there any way to gauge the final consumption of your products and how that is going to shift with the increased global growth at the expense of U.S. growth in PC consumption? Thank you. ", "John F. Coyne", "We get some visibility to that in the distribution channel and retail through our point of sales data. It\u2019s not so clear necessarily in our OEM business where those products finally end up, but what we are seeing in our direct business is a lot of strength in Latin America, in China, in the Eastern European countries, in India. So all of the BRIC economies, we are seeing significant strength there and we believe from talking with customers that that\u2019s -- that the OEMs that we sell to are looking at a similar profile in their businesses. ", "Robert Marson ", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. John Coyne. ", "John F. Coyne", "", "I would just like to recap the highlights of the call. We are very pleased with our sustained progress against our profitable growth objective year to date. We continue to feel good about the robust demand forecasted for the industry over the next several years and we feel good about WD\u2019s opportunity to continue to prosper by providing compelling solutions to our customers.

Welcome to Western Digital's fourth quarter financial results for fiscal year 2008. (Operator Instructions) Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin. ", "Bob Blair", "Thank you. I want to mention that we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning: our financial and operational performance; our business model, cost structure and customer satisfaction; demand, growth, pricing and inventory in the hard drive industry; our expectations for the September quarter; our growth opportunities, new product designs and our execution capabilities; our expectations regarding our WD VelociRaptor products and GreenPower technology; our investments in technology, capacity and infrastructure; our aspirations to serve every mass storage market segment; the efficiencies of our in-house hard drive controller design and development and how it will enhance the efficiencies of our development process with our existing SOC supply partners; the cost benefits of the integration of our media operations; our effective tax rate; repurchases of our stock; our cash conversion cycle; and our financial outlook for the September quarter and the second-half of calendar year 2008.

", "We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events, and you should not assume later in the quarter that the comments that we make today are still valid.", "I also want to note that copies of remarks by WD executive John Coyne and Tim Leyden from today\u2019s call will be available on the investor section of Western Digital\u2019s website immediately following the conclusion of this call.", "I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to John Coyne, Chief Executive Officer of Western Digital.", "John F. Coyne", "Thanks, Bob. Good afternoon and thank you for joining CFO Tim Leyden and myself today. Following my remarks, Tim will review our financial performance in fiscal year 2008 and our fourth quarter, and provide our outlook for the September quarter. ", "Fiscal \u201808 was an outstanding year for WD, capped off with a solid fourth quarter financial performance reported earlier today. For the year, we grew revenue 48% and earnings 54%, delivering on our primary goal of profitable growth. ", "We generated $1.5 billion in cash from operations during the year. We also successfully concluded our $1 billion acquisition of Komag and have completed the integration of the new media operation and are already generating solid technology and cost contributions to the overall business.", "  ", "Our fiscal \u201808 performance provides further evidence of disciplined operational and financial performance and the continued scalability and execution excellence of the ", "WD team.", "  ", "Customer satisfaction with WD\u2019s broad product line, high quality and reliability, service excellence, and overall value proposition continues to drive our business growth. We are very pleased with the continued, consistent performance of the efficient business model that we have built and refined over the last several years.  ", "While maintaining focus in the high-volume desktop segment, we have made major strides in diversifying the business by establishing our footprint in newer, faster-growth markets such as the 2.5-inch notebook drives, branded products, consumer electronics, and SATA drives for the enterprise. ", "As a result of this activity in higher-growth areas, we saw our hard-drive revenues from non-desktop markets expand to 56% of revenue in fiscal \u201808, compared with 43% in fiscal \u201807 and 29% in fiscal \u201906, and we exit the year with 63% of Q4 revenues derived from non-desktop, higher-growth applications. ", "It is worth noting that in the June quarter, WD was less reliant on the desktop business as a share of revenue and units than either Seagate or Samsung.", "Now, let me briefly address industry conditions as we ended the June quarter and enter the new fiscal year. My remarks are confined to the markets served by WD for 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch SATA and PATA hard drives.", "Despite concerns with macroeconomic conditions, June quarter industry demand was strong relative to seasonal patterns and expectations, coming in flat with the March quarter and increasing 19% year-over-year. 3.5-inch demand in the quarter was down 4% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year, in line with expectation. 2.5-inch demand was stronger than expected, up 7% sequentially and up a very healthy 45% year-over-year. ", "Strong year-on-year sales growth in Asia for the quarter reflected our success in the 2.5-inch notebook market, offsetting muted demand in the U.S. and Western Europe. ", "Industry shipments of 21.5 million units in the last week of the quarter represented 18% of total shipments in the quarter, an increase of half-a-week compared to the 14% shipped in the same week last year. This increase was likely due to the fact that certain hard drive companies ended their quarter on June 30th, a Monday this year but a Saturday last year, adding extra days of shipment opportunity.", "Industry inventories for manufacturers and distribution exiting the June quarter were down sequentially and compare favorably with the same time last year, up only 10% over last year while supporting a market which grew 19% year-over-year. This represents a reduction of one full week of supply on a year-over-year basis. ", "Manufacturers\u2019 inventory reduced by some 4 million units sequentially and is at a little over one week of supply. Distribution inventory was also down some 700,000 units sequentially and is in the middle of the normal four- to six-week range.  ", "Pricing in the distribution channel, which accounts for some 20% of the total hard drive revenue stream, is driven more than any other industry segment by short-term supply/demand dynamics. The desktop market is uniquely weighted towards distribution, with a roughly 50-50 split between distribution and OEM customers. ", "Distribution pricing was especially tough last quarter because of a competitor\u2019s large inventory overhang exiting March, which led to the industry\u2019s highest quarterly price erosion in the desktop distribution channel since 2001, at 16%. ", "While the inventory overhang was largely eliminated by June quarter-end and current inventory levels are in good shape, this price erosion had a spillover impact on OEM September quarter price negotiations, as well as creating a depressed distribution pricing floor entering the new quarter.  ", "We navigated through these conditions reasonably well, helped by our lesser dependence on desktop business. We also leveraged our responsive manufacturing capability to adjust product and segment mix. We expect that the conditions created in the June quarter will have some residual impact on the industry and our business through the current quarter. ", "I would now like to describe the recent results of our multi-year diversification effort on a market-by-market basis and tell you why we think we are well-positioned to continue our profitable growth in the year ahead, primarily based on compelling products that are currently shipping.  ", "Continued execution of our demonstrated product design and deployment capability is also important in driving the continued potential of the WD profitable growth story in future years. Looking at our individual markets, we tripled our 2.5-inch drive shipments year-over-year to 36.6 million units, demonstrating technology and product leadership throughout the year. Even with this success, we have yet to ship meaningful volume to three of the world's top 10 notebook OEMs, leaving significant growth opportunities in our mainstream 5400 RPM product line. ", "In June we began shipping our new line of WD Scorpio Black 7200 RPM 2.5-inch SATA hard drives in capacities up to 320 gigabytes for high performance notebook markets.  This important product expansion offers our customers another opportunity to embrace the WD value proposition of quality, reliability and availability in the notebook segment.  ", "We grew revenue in our branded products business by 60% year-over-year to $1.4 billion and we continue to add new products and product features to the line-up, to strengthen our leadership position and expand our available market. ", "In the June quarter, we completed the rollout of the popular My Passport Essential series with a refreshed design in multiple colors, and over the last several months we began shipping many new and next-generation branded products, including the My Passport Elite fully-featured portable USB hard drive in capacities of 320 and 250 gigabytes; the Mac-formatted My Passport Studio portable hard drive for Apple Mac users, targeting a discerning, fast-growing sub-segment of the branded business; the newest model of our 3.5-inch My Book series, the Mirror Edition dual drive storage system, which automatically stores content not once but twice to maximize safety and security of users\u2019 valuable content; and a USB version of the WD My DVR Expander, significantly expanding the recording capacity of Dish Network HD DVRs.", "In Enterprise SATA, a fast-growing segment of enterprise storage, we continued to innovate with the introduction of our 3.5-inch SATA GreenPower drive series and the WD VelociRaptor drive family, the industry\u2019s first 300-gigabyte 10,000 RPM 2.5-inch drive.  ", "Over the last few years, the fastest growing segment in the mainstream enterprise market is 2.5-inch SAS drives for blade servers and storage.

A few questions, I guess first, can you give us a sense on Komag\u2019s contribution in the fiscal fourth quarter, both from a margin and a revenue perspective and whether or not you think as you move forward, you\u2019ll continue to see some further synergies from Komag?", "Tim Leyden", "Komag, Rich, we got 80 basis points in the December quarter, a further 40 basis points in the March quarter, and an additional 80 basis points in the June quarter, so we are at a cumulative 200 basis points of increased gross margin, or reduced cost, is a better way to put it, as we stand at this point. We are still on track and expect to reach full cost benefit by the end of December of this year and we expect that to happen pretty much linearly between now and then.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company", "So that means 100 basis points at least in the 19.3 is coming from Komag. I guess that begs the question, how much of the business do you normally walk into at the beginning of a quarter through auctions with OEMs? And does that really vary by desktop versus notebook?", "John F. Coyne", "I think first, the 100 basis points is spread over the next two quarters in terms of contribution from the Komag cost improvement. And the -- typically the vast bulk of our OEM business is decided before we exit the prior quarter. ", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay, so the opportunity for upside to your gross margin guidance then has to largely occur within the channel, and so if channel prices are less aggressive than what you are at least anticipating in your guidance, then that would represent the opportunity for upside, plus mix, I guess?", "John F. Coyne", "We\u2019re running the business the way we run the business.

And then moving that, if you wanted to migrate that 2.5-inch SAS product, how much engineering and time would that take?", "John F. Coyne", "I think the good news is that there\u2019s a significant infrastructure now in place, and continuing for 2.5-inch form factor in both the blade server and storage markets. And our desire would be to see similar adoption of SATA in that space that we\u2019ve seen over the past four or five years in the 3.5-inch space, so that\u2019s item one. ", "To your second question, I think the engineering investment in mainstream enterprise is significant, both in terms of development and support, once serving that market.

I assume that disti would tick up as a percent, but I just wanted to get a little color on that, and then I have a follow-up, please.

As we go into Q1, again the starting point of the pricing has pretty much been set, so we will have an impact on the OEM pricing, as John also indicated. And we expect to have a 2.5 -- with the 2.5 at this stage, 2.5-inch, we\u2019re seeing that most suppliers at this stage have the capability to provide a broad mix.

", "Keith Bachmann - BMO Capital Markets", "So Tim, just to push you a little bit, does that mean that disti goes up as a percent of your total units in Q1?", "John F. Coyne", "The other thing in relation to that to recognize is that while the desktop disti market if a 50-50 disti and OEM market, the 2.5-inch space is more like 80-20 OEM -- 80% OEM, 20% disti, so our success in the 2.5-inch space in and of itself dilutes our overall distribution content in our business.", "Keith Bachmann - BMO Capital Markets", "But I was thinking, John, if more people are participating in the 2.5-inch space that might suggest that your disti content would actually go up this quarter.

Are you seeing any worsening of the channel since the quarter began in terms of pricing?", "John F. Coyne", "I think nothing unseasonal; I mean, recognize that we came in at a pretty low point and expectations I think were not there that the inventory had actually been worked off during last quarter. I think there was a -- despite the data to the contrary, I think there was an expectation that the -- there was more product around than there needed to be, and so turning that perception around has taken a little bit of time.

We\u2019ve had a very consistent approach to sourcing in the open market since we acquired our internal head capability. We\u2019ve had a very long relationship with TDK SAE, a very positive relationship. They are a great supplier.

Is that primarily still a high-end product? It seems that there are a number of NetBooks that are looking, or incorporating solid states. Can you just give us some idea of how you are perceiving that and its development now?", "John F. Coyne", "Sure. I think we\u2019re looking at it in three distinct market applications for SSDs, the first of those being in the high-end enterprise, which is an [inaudible] requirement, a performance requirement, not really a large storage requirement. And so we\u2019ve seen announcements in that space. We believe that there\u2019s some compelling value being offered there and there certainly seems to be an economic case, as well as a technical case for deployment of SSDs into that kind of environment. ", "The second area where SSDs have probably been most heavily marketed and have been lightly distributed is in the high style notebook arena -- full featured, full sized notebook, things like the Macbook Air and several announcements from most of the PC notebook manufacturers. In that space, we believe that the customer experience, those few customers who actually have one, that the customer experience has been essentially negative, relative to the overhyped benefits. And that that potentially puts back -- that and the cost put back the adoption rate probably by 12 months against current forecasts. ", "And then the third area of application has been in the ultra-mobile PC, or the SUSE EPC type market, which is a market focused on meeting price point and providing a level of functionality at a price point. ", "What we are seeing there is the first generation of those devices, essentially they were with four, eight, 12-gigabytes of Flash memory, and what we are seeing in this year\u2019s announcements over the last couple of months of the second generation is that that market seems to be bifurcating to on the low end, $399 type price point, a 7-inch screen with a 12-gig of SSD and probably a Linux operating system. And then a more functional, more feature, richer machine at somewhere in the $400 pricing point, which is going to a 10-inch screen, operating an XP-based system, and incorporating a 2.5-inch hard drive. So that\u2019s kind of how we are seeing that shaking out. ", "And it looks like the low-end machine is beginning to develop some penetration in completely new markets that have lower disposable income levels than the markets currently being served by the entire PC portfolio, and we are seeing the higher featured machine targeted as incremental sales into developed markets, where a second PC or a third PC is being bought in that fashion.

A couple of questions, gentlemen; I want to first get back to the rank and file, if you could, in terms of the swing factors for your outlook. Getting back to Mr. Bachmann\u2019s question as far as the OEM mix, can you kind of rank order how much is OEM mix versus maybe potential share loss, as manufacturing parity does increase in terms of your competitors now able to execute? And then thirdly, just general pricing dynamics.

", "John F. Coyne", "We\u2019re not modeling share loss. We\u2019re modeling that our mix, which has been very rich, from the beginning of last fiscal year and getting a little lighter each quarter as we move through the year, our mix becomes to look much like the market demand, and that\u2019s driven by two dimensions. One is that our growth has basically meant that we need to service a market lookalike demand because of our size at each account, and the other piece of that is that as our competitors have gradually come up with the ability to ship the full range of capacities, that provides more choice to our customers also. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Thank you on that part. And then, have you ever given us any context around the notebook class drive shipments that WD exhibits each quarter in terms of how much is going into an actual PC versus external back-up? When you guys say you are shipping notebook, is that all for notebook PCs or is that for other as well?", "John F. Coyne", "It\u2019s for all 2.5-inch shipments, the 11.7 million is our total 2.5-inch shipments. Some of that went into notebook PCs, some of it went into external storage solutions built by others, and some of it went into our own branded products. We don\u2019t break it out. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "You don\u2019t break it out. Is it fair to say that that piece though, the notebook class is higher than your overall branded business, in terms of 2.5-inch versus 3.5-inch shipping into the retail market?", "John F. Coyne", "I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m getting the question right. Certainly our shipments into notebook computers are significantly larger than the shipments into the external attached marketplace. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. And then if we could shift gears, John, could you maybe talk a little about your new product tone in terms of -- obviously you said you won\u2019t pre-announce products until you actually start shipping, but your tone seems to be a little more constructive, I think ever since November of \u201906 when you first started talking about the enterprise as a potential market. Can you maybe just talk about what\u2019s changed and should we expect more announcements in the coming months ahead?", "John F. Coyne", "Well, absolutely.

Can you talk about what that can mean for the model, what that can mean for some of your design or new product development down the road?", "John F. Coyne", "Certainly. As you\u2019ve seen over the past five years, as we\u2019ve grown the company and grown the financial resources of the company, we have also in parallel been gathering in the fundamental technology capability to drive the business forward and to improve the fundamental efficiency from an engineering perspective. When you own all of the technology pieces, you can better and more efficiently and more timely put together the optimization of the system, and so we did that with Hedge, we did it with Media, and we\u2019ve now brought HDC controller design and development back into the company again. We\u2019ve had it outside for maybe eight years, I guess, something in that range. So we brought that capability back in house and the objective there is to improve the efficiency so that the HDC core, just like all of our competitors have their own HDC capability, we now have that and therefore all of the firmware that we write to operate that core can now be common across our multiple drive platforms, and can be -- we\u2019ll continue to then embed that technology in the SOCs, paired up with the best channel and the best execution with our existing SOC suppliers.

We were surprised and I believe the industry overall would express surprise with how rapidly the inventory overhang was worked off by moderation of production capacity, and so I think that\u2019s a very, very positive sign for the industry. We\u2019ve just got to see the seasonal demand roll in and maintain that discipline into this quarter, and I think your proposition as you opened your questions that things could get a lot better in the December quarter is pretty sound.

Is it as bad as the desktop market, or is it a little bit better?", "John F. Coyne", "Notebook is pretty much running to our expectation. It is exhibiting the characteristics of a six supplier market with all six suppliers having capability to address virtually every segment of the market. ", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, and then in terms of the CapEx guidance, it looks like CapEx is going up about 30% year over year. It\u2019s a little bit more than I would have expected. Can you maybe help us understand why that\u2019s going up 30%?", "Tim Leyden", "We had anticipated that we would spend a little bit more during the course of 2008, but as we manage our CapEx to a just-in-time capability, we\u2019ve pushed more out into 2009 and that includes our wafer fab conversion, which you\u2019ll notice that we had anticipated that there was going to be a $200 million expenditure in that in the course of 2008 and we actually came in at about 120, I believe. And in 2009, we were going to have $100 million and the slowdown that we had in 2008 is actually spilling over into 2009, which is responsible for most of the up-tick. ", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, and then I just have a quick question on the bringing in of the controller design technology -- does that allow you to design a controller for a solid state drive or is that only going to allow you access to design for the HDD controllers?", "John F. Coyne", "We will have the capability to design a controller for any media and any interface. ", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital", "Thank you. Just on the -- a follow-up again on the controller question; are you ultimately trying to bring the design of your system on-chip controller entirely in-house?", "John F. Coyne", "Controller portion, yes. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital", "Perfect. And then, if one wanted to be an optimist, if possible, the good news that you highlight is that production and inventory are at last in check. Seagate obviously flushed through their entire inventory by getting their builds wrong. The rest of the industry behaved the best they could and watched them sell all those drives. The good news is that perhaps if seasonality and demand continues in the December quarter, that gross margins could improve. ", "Tim Leyden", "Yeah, I mean, that\u2019s what the expectation would be if we get back to -- if we get back to a normal back-to-school season and normal demand patterns in the Christmas quarter, yes. And with the inventory overhang gone, yes, there should be an improvement in margins. ", "John F. Coyne", "Which would be extremely good, given that current margins that we are forecasting are already higher than last year. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital", "Right, exactly. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Matt [Nahorski] with Wachovia.", "Matt Nahorski - Wachovia", "Just a couple of quick questions about headcount; number one, can you just talk about where you added headcount in the quarter and what your thoughts are around headcount throughout fiscal \u201909? Thanks. ", "John F. Coyne", "You\u2019ll see headcount increase substantially in the quarterly report, up to 50,000 from about 42. That\u2019s really a factor of a decision that we made in Thailand to convert a large number of contract workers to full-time WD direct employees. Outside of that reclassification, and that brought them into the WD employee report, outside of that reclassification, our hiring was pretty normal, targeting support of our growth as well as specific investments in engineering and other parts of the support structure of the business to drive our future. ", "Operator", "Our last question comes from Scott Craig with Banc of America.  ", "Scott Craig - Banc of America", "Thanks. Good afternoon. Just quickly on the CapEx side of things; if I strip out the wafer expenditures, the CapEx is still going to be up around 30% year over year in fiscal 2009, so can you maybe discuss where the CapEx is going to be spent, in particular focusing on how much capacity, perhaps in percentage or in units that you think that you could add?", "Tim Leyden", "Our component expenditure and our media expenditure together accounts for close to two-thirds of the total CapEx expenditure. And then, in addition to that we have to deal with the mix of test, as the mix gets larger, the -- we have to spend more time on test and therefore more capital expenditure. So the remainder is in the back-end, which is assembly test and R&D type expenditure. ", "Scott Craig - Banc of America", "Okay, so you don\u2019t have any rough estimate on how much you\u2019ll think you\u2019ll increase the unit capacity capabilities in 2009? And is there any -- how does the linearity of the expenditures occur over the course of the year? How much flexibility do you have there?", "Tim Leyden", "What we\u2019ve been spending in normal business situation, other than the increment that we are spending for the wafer fab conversion, for several years it was at 6% of revenue, and then with media, added about another percent. So consequently, from a modeling viewpoint, a good model to use excluding the increment for wafer conversion, wafer fab conversion is in the 7% range or so. ", "Scott Craig - Banc of America", "Okay, and if I could just ask one more -- there was a couple of times on the call where you mentioned that you felt that the competitors were capable of providing all products across all the ranges for 2.5 and 3.5-inch, but it\u2019s been clear that you guys have had a nice technological lead in the 2.5-inch notebook space, so can you describe the competitive dynamics there, whether you still think you have a lead, how far that lead is, and how long you think it will last, the gap between yourselves and competitors?", "John F. Coyne", "Of course, it will be our endeavor to maintain it forever. I think we are still advantaged somewhat in the sense that we\u2019ve built the franchise over the last year and we will certainly endeavor to maintain that. And we\u2019ll make product announcements as we ship product.  ", "Scott Craig - Banc of America", "Do you feel the competition is closing that gap at all, or will close it in the back part of calendar 2008?", "John F. Coyne", "I think we\u2019ll have to wait and see who ships what when, and then we\u2019ll know. We don\u2019t pay much attention to announcements of future intent. We focus more on what actually gets done. ", "Scott Craig - Banc of America", "All right, thanks. ", "John F. Coyne", "So in closing, I would like to thank you again for joining us. We are very encouraged by the overall market opportunities for WD growth in the hard drive markets in the years ahead and I look forward to keeping you informed of our progress. Thank you.

Good afternoon and welcome to SanDisk Corporation\u2019s financial teleconference for the third quarter of 2008. I\u2019m Lori Barker, SanDisk\u2019s Senior Director of Investor Relations. Joining me is Dr. Eli Harari, Chairman and CEO of SanDisk, Sanjay Mehrotra, President and COO, and Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President of Administration and CFO.   ", " ", "The agenda for today\u2019s teleconference is as follows: Eli will start with an update on the industry and SanDisk\u2019s overall strategy. Judy will follow with a review of our third quarter financial results and future guidance and Sanjay will also join us for the question and answer session at the end of the call.

We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof.   ", " ", "Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our CEO, Eli Harari.", "Eli Harari ", "Thank you, Lori and thank you for joining us. Today, I\u2019m going to talk to you about four key topics -- the first one is industry conditions and SanDisk\u2019s competitive positioning; the second one is today\u2019s announcement with Toshiba about restructuring our joint venture manufacturing agreements and other proactive steps that we are taking to maintain our competitiveness and further strengthen our balance sheet; then I\u2019ll talk about IP developments; and I\u2019ll conclude with our perspective on Samsung\u2019s proposal. ", " ", "Our industry continues to experience excessive inventories, operating losses and weakening balance sheets, as a result of NAND fab investment decisions that were made well before the current global economic crisis. Recently, major NAND manufacturers announced shut-downs of 200-millimeter NAND wafer fabs and push outs of new 300-millimeter capacity. This is a positive step for bringing supply into balance with demand so that pricing can stabilize and so that profitability can return. ", "Although this correction will not be felt overnight, I believe that patience will be rewarded. Meanwhile, demand for NAND flash megabytes continues to grow as current pricing trends are accelerating the adoption of NAND in new markets such as GPS, video capture, high-end handsets, and solid-state disks in computing applications. ", " ", "SanDisk is in an exceptionally strong competitive position. Fab 4 is ramping 43-nanometer technology at a remarkable rate and with excellent yields, and we believe that the massive scale of Fabs 3 and 4 combined applied at 43-nanometer and 3 bits per cell now provides us the lowest cost NAND in the industry. ", "In the first quarter of 2009, we expect to start customer shipments of 32-gigabit NAND with 3 bits per cell architecture that achieves a smaller die size than a competitor\u2019s 34-nanometer NAND with 2 bits per cell architecture. In the second quarter of 2009, we expect to start customer shipments of the industry\u2019s first 64-gigabit die employing 4 bits per cell X4 technology, manufactured again on 43-nanometer technology. By mid-2009 SanDisk and Toshiba expect to commence the transition from the 43-nanometer to the 32-nanometer technology node, including 3 bits per cell designs.  ", " ", "While such a low-cost supply base is expected to be a significant competitive advantage for us in 2009 and 2010, the global economic crisis is slowing demand growth in the near-term and this is the underlying cause for excess supply, severe pricing, and hence our disappointing results. On the marketing and sales end, we believe that our diversified OEM and global retail sales channels provide us a measure of resiliency in the current tough market conditions. ", " ", "I will now discuss our actions to align ourselves with the business outlook for 2009. In a highly significant development this morning, SanDisk and Toshiba announced a non-binding memorandum of understanding, MOU, under which we will sell to Toshiba approximately 30% of our current captive capacity at Fab 3 and Fab 4. We expect to receive cash and reduce equipment lease obligations in an aggregate amount of approximately $1 billion dollars. ", "We will have the option to purchase from Toshiba, on preferred foundry terms, a portion of the transferred capacity. This agreement will accelerate our previously stated intention to move from the current 100% captive supply to 80% captive, 20% non-captive, which we believe going forward will provide us the flexibility to better manage our inventory up or down with market demand. ", "For future capacity expansions and technology transitions in Fabs 3 and 4, we will continue to have the option, at our discretion, to participate at up to 50% of such capacity additions. We expect to sign a definitive agreement in the current quarter and implement it in the first quarter of 2009. ", " ", "We now expect our 2008 capital investment outlays to be approximately $500 million below the $2.4 billion in our original 2008 plan. In 2009, we now expect our CapEx investments to be approximately $1.3 billion, down from the previously planned $3 billion and this investment will mostly be geared towards supporting the manufacturing technology upgrades that I discussed earlier, which further extend our technology leadership.   ", " ", "In addition to restructuring our supply commitments and reducing our CapEx, we are taking actions to lower our operating expenses. These actions will be implemented in the current quarter and will include canceling or exiting a number of product and marketing activities, and will result in employee reductions in R&D, sales & marketing, G&A and Operations. We will continue to invest in the areas that are most strategic for our future, including advanced NAND and 3D read/write development, mobile storage, solid-state disk, and slotMusic.  ", " ", "Shifting now to IP matters, earlier this year we won a binding arbitration ruling in the Samsung-msystems case involving license rights to the msystems patent portfolio that we acquired in 2006. An arbitration panel ruled that Samsung breached its agreement with msystems and had therefore forfeited its perpetual license rights to msystems patents, including patents covering X4, that\u2019s 4 bits per cell NAND, and patents that teach important system level flash technologies. Samsung appealed this ruling in federal court but subsequently withdrew and asked the court to enter judgment against them. The net effect is that absent a patent cross license renewal by August 2009, Samsung will not be licensed to either msystems or SanDisk\u2019s patent portfolios.  ", " ", "The final topic I want to address is Samsung\u2019s proposal. As you know, Samsung indicated an interest to acquire SanDisk for $26 per share. SanDisk\u2019s board made it clear to Samsung in a letter dated September 15 that it is open to a transaction at the right price with the right process and the right protections for SanDisk\u2019s shareholders. Our board strongly believes that Samsung\u2019s indication of interest significantly undervalues SanDisk, both in the absolute and in light of the synergies and the value of our IP to Samsung. Samsung stands to gain enormous value from owning our patents and our know-how; in particular, the hundreds of second generation patents for mobile storage that we developed in-house or acquired in the past decade. These second generation patents extend well into the next decade, and therefore the intrinsic value to Samsung is highly strategic and long-term. ", "The future of the mobile storage industry we believe is in All-Bit-Line ABL-multi-level cell 3 bits per cell MLC, 4 bits per cell MLC, managed NAND, 3D Read/Write, advanced controllers, mobile security, and solid-state drives. SanDisk holds many of the fundamental patents and know-how for these technologies and Samsung knows it. This is why owning these patents and the know-how is so critical for Samsung\u2019s future profitability. ", " ", "The SanDisk board of directors remains open-minded about a potential transaction with Samsung. Our board is focused on the right price and the right protections for our shareholders, including the renewal of the Samsung IP patent cross license in case a transaction does not close. This was formally and publicly communicated to Samsung and as of this time, there have been no further communications between the two companies on this topic. ", "We will not be taking questions on this matter during Q&A; however I direct you to our press release dated September 16th for a more complete discussion of our board\u2019s stated position, which remains our current position. ", " ", "In conclusion, we are building our business for the future and adapting quickly to the near-term realities in our markets by taking strong proactive steps to sharpen our focus and strengthen our balance sheet. I firmly believe that SanDisk will emerge stronger than ever in the next recovery. ", " ", "I will turn it now to Judy.", "Judy Bruner", "Thank you Eli. Our third quarter revenue was in the upper end of the range we expected, with strong bit growth driven by a higher-than-anticipated price decline, which negatively impacted gross margins. We made the decision during the quarter to price more aggressively than we had planned in order to move inventory and maintain our market share.   ", " ", "Our third quarter product revenue was flat to the second quarter with megabytes sold up 44% and ASP per megabyte down 30%. Third quarter revenue was up sequentially in mobile, USB, GPS, and audio/video products, and down in imaging and gaming products. ", "On a year-over-year basis, megabytes sold increased 105% and ASP per megabyte declined 63%, resulting in product revenue down 25%. This year-over-year decline in revenue was driven by the NAND pricing environment and despite the recessionary market conditions, our unit sales grew 9% year-over-year and average capacity increased 89%, demonstrating continued growth in demand for NAND storage in consumer applications.   ", " ", "Revenue in the retail channel grew 3% sequentially to 63% of our product revenue, while OEM revenue was down 4%. Our North America retail revenue grew 12% from Q2, driven primarily by back-to-school sales of USBs and growing demand for mobile handset cards. Europe retail revenue was down sequentially and Asia-Pacific retail revenue was flat, as weak macroeconomic conditions spread beyond the U.S. However, we grew international market share both sequentially and year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, Q3 retail revenue was down 29% and OEM revenue was down 18%.   ", " ", "License and royalty revenue for the third quarter of $132 million increased 3% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. Royalty revenue based on NAND component revenue was down sequentially and growth came from new licenses.   ", " ", "Non-GAAP product gross profit for Q3 was a negative $121 million and was impacted by the 30% price decline and inventory related charges of $109 million, up from charges of $70 million in the second quarter. Third quarter inventory charges were primarily for lower of cost or market, for both on-hand and channel inventory. Pricing was more aggressive than we had planned and we took our prices down to match the market in order to stimulate average capacities and avoid excessive inventory buildup. The restructuring of our fab joint ventures will accelerate the rightsizing of our captive supply and allow us to return sooner to a more flexible model in which non-captive supply allows us to more easily increase or decrease inventory purchases.", "Non-GAAP operating expenses of $217 million were down 3% sequentially with increases in advertising and merchandising offset by decreases in legal and engineering project expenses. Our headcount increased by 429 to 3,751 due to assembly line workers at our Shanghai factory being converted from temporary to regular status. We have been increasing the proportion of our assembly and test done in-house, and our captive cost per unit is now substantially lower than our contract manufacturing cost.  ", " ", "Other Income & Expense was approximately zero compared to $21 million of income in the prior quarter. Q3 interest income was offset by a $12 million charge for the decrease in value of stock held in a foundry supplier, Tower Semiconductor, and a $10 million impairment charge related to our wind-down of the FlashVision joint venture, resulting from limited demand for 200 millimeter equipment.   ", " ", "On the balance sheet, cash and short and long-term investments increased sequentially by $104 million to $2.6 billion. Cash flow from operations was a positive $136 million, driven by the bi-annual receipt of royalty receivables and a decrease in product receivables and inventory. Inventory decreased $83 million or 10% sequentially as incremental inventory reserves and the lower 43nm cost per megabyte more than offset an increase in inventory megabytes. Channel inventory ended Q3 between 8 and 9 weeks, similar to the level at the end of Q2. The decrease in product receivables was the result of strong collections and the issuance of price protection and promotion credits consistent with the current pricing environment. Capital investments included a $93 million loan to the Fab 4 joint venture for capacity expansion and the purchase of $45 million of SanDisk capital equipment, offset by the return of $74 million from the 200mm joint venture and $39 million from the sale of 200mm equipment that we owned directly. We also guaranteed $237 million of incremental operating leases for Fab 4 equipment. ", " ", "I\u2019ll now turn to forward-looking commentary. Please note that non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation tables are posted on our website for all applicable guidance. Given weak global macroeconomic conditions, we are expecting less seasonal lift in Q4 unit sales than we have seen historically, and we are expecting a continuation of aggressive industry pricing. With the uncertainty in global markets, we are forecasting a wider than usual range for total revenue of $725 to $875 million. This includes license and royalty revenue which is expected to be lower in Q4 than in Q3.  ", " ", "We expect product gross margins to continue to be negative in Q4 and likely into the first half of 2009. We expect fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expense to be between $250 and $260 million, including a restructuring charge, seasonal increases in advertising and merchandising and increased legal expenses related to the ITC trial starting next week. We expect to cut our non-GAAP operating expenses to approximately $800M for 2009, and we will finalize and implement our restructuring actions this quarter.   ", " ", "Last quarter I indicated that we might face a non-cash impairment charge related to goodwill and intangible assets. Given the increase in our stock price at the end of the third quarter, we did not record any impairment. However, if our market cap were to be lower than our net assets at the end of any future quarter, this could lead to a non-cash impairment charge. ", " ", "We expect Q4 capital investments to total approximately $300 million including approximately $250 million of fab investment related to the Fab 4 capacity expansion just completed and approximately $50 million of SanDisk non-fab related CapEx. For 2009, we expect to reduce our total capital investment including fab and other CapEx to approximately $1.3 billion, down more than 50% from the $3.0 billion we described at our analyst day early this year. We expect the $1.3 billion to be financed about two-thirds with new operating leases and joint venture working capital, and about one-third with cash. The proposed restructuring of our fab joint ventures will result in us receiving approximately $1.0 billion of value, split roughly 50/50 between cash proceeds we expect to receive from Toshiba and relief from currently existing operating leases. I\u2019d also like to take a moment to let you know that we have cured the non-compliance that was created on some of the joint venture operating leases when we were downgraded last quarter by Standard & Poors. We will pay an increased spread on those leases, but the cost is not material to our future results.   ", " ", "In terms of cash usage, we do expect to use cash in Q408 due to anticipated losses, the timing of royalty revenue payments, and investment in CapEx and inventory, however we expect that the restructuring of the fab joint ventures will help to replenish cash in early 2009.   ", " ", "In summary, we are taking aggressive actions on multiple fronts to achieve a more appropriate supply model and restructure our internal operations, all with a focus on strengthening our balance sheet, improving the bottom line and emerging an even stronger competitor when the NAND market recovers. ", " ", "Operator, may we open the call for questions, please. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Craig Ellis at Citigroup. ", "Craig Ellis - Citigroup", "Thanks. The first question is to Judy -- Judy, on the royalty guidance for the fourth quarter, can you be a little bit more specific than just down quarter on quarter?", "Judy Bruner", "I\u2019m not going to give a range for the royalty revenue in Q4 but we expect that it will be down due to the pricing environment in Q3. We expect that our licensees\u2019 revenue that is applicable to the royalties would be impacted by the aggressive pricing that existed in the third quarter. ", "Craig Ellis - Citigroup", "Okay, and then the follow-up question is for Eli -- Eli, you had indicated that you wouldn\u2019t talk about the Samsung deal but can you talk a little bit about value creation for shareholders? Obviously the board thinks the $26 price under-values the company but when does the company feel like it can deliver results that would drive the stock price well north of $26 into the level that the company or the company\u2019s board thinks that the stock price is worth?", "Eli Harari ", "Again, I cannot discuss, as we said, the Samsung proposal but I can tell you that the actions we are announcing today that we have been working on and we will implement this fourth quarter are definitely taken with mind to manage our business to keep our strength and at the same time to take some of the cuts, some painful cuts, that we believe we have to do in order to maintain a very strong balance sheet, have a focus on the programs that are very strategic to our future. ", "So without commenting of course on the share price or anything of that nature, I can tell you that I am optimistic that once this -- that like I said, the steps that the industry is taking and that we are taking are sowing the seeds for return of balance between demand and supply and that whenever that happens, I believe that we will be very competitive and at that point, I think things can change for the better. They have in the past. This is not the first time that we\u2019ve been through a down cycle. This one is perhaps more severe than previous one and certainly the macroeconomic environment is quite unique. But we are strong and we have now a very strong balance sheet and are prepared to take the necessary actions to manage for a better future. ", "Craig Ellis - Citigroup", "A follow-up on that, if I may though -- the company will be relying more on external sourcing for its components and that invariably means a higher cost of goods sold and therefore a lower product gross margin and therefore how should we think about the way the company views its target gross margin model doing forward if the percent of components is higher coming from external sources?", "Eli Harari ", "You know, we have in the past had the 70-30 model, as you\u2019ll recall, that gave us the flexibility that was very valued. The market today is much bigger. We are -- we believe that certainly today\u2019s environment demonstrates that that model does have its benefits. There\u2019s no question that there will be -- no question in my mind that there will be periods in the future of allocation where we wish that we had more captive supply or in fact that we could be denied to have all the supply we want from non-captive sources. But this is really the trade-off that we want to make to allow us to manage our inventories also in downturns, not just in up-turns, and also to bring some balance between our investments in brick-and-mortar capacity, captive capacity and in our investments in innovation and in products and new market creation. So this is really is a direction that I think is very significant for the company and I think it\u2019s really a great step forward, really important step forward. ", "Lori Barker", "Thanks. Next caller, please. ", "Operator", "And we will go next to Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.", "Edwin Mok - Needham & Company", "Thanks for taking my question. First is just quickly on the Toshiba deal, I\u2019m just curious, when are you actually going to get the cash from Toshiba?", "Judy Bruner", "We expect that we will receive the cash in Q1 of \u201909. ", "Edwin Mok - Needham & Company", "Great, and then on the operating [inaudible], you mentioned that you expect around $800 million on OpEx in 2009. Do you expect to fully recognize that savings by the first quarter of 2009 or is that [inaudible]?", "Judy Bruner", "We are planning to take restructuring actions in the company in the fourth quarter of this year so that we can enter 2009 at a lower expense level. ", "Edwin Mok - Needham & Company", "Great, and then on your guidance, on your revenue guidance in terms of your ASP in terms of the guidance, do you expect it to decline in the level in the fourth quarter or better than the fourth quarter or worse [in the fourth quarter]? How do you [inaudible]?", "Judy Bruner", "We expect the pricing environment to continue to be aggressive in the fourth quarter. It\u2019s possible that it could be at a similar rate to the third quarter. ", "Edwin Mok - Needham & Company", "Great, and then I have one final question -- regarding the sales channel, you mentioned that part of your sales strategy is to provide price guarantees for your large I guess OEM or distributor. How do you view that strategy going forward, given how much pricing pressure there is in the market? Wouldn\u2019t that inherently would have hurt either your gross margin or your [inaudible] because [inaudible] price guarantees [inaudible]?", "Judy Bruner", "Price protection does definitely impact our profitability and our gross margins. There has been no change really in our practices here over the years. It\u2019s just that pricing, when pricing is very aggressive, you see the impact of that but it really is not so much of a difference whether the pricing happens at one point or another. You are just selling at the latest, lowest price. We don\u2019t recognize our revenue until it sells through and so at the time that it sells through because we are giving price protection, we are recognizing that revenue at the latest, lowest price. ", "Eli Harari ", "Price protection applies of course to retail sales, not to OEM sales. ", "Edwin Mok - Needham & Company", "I see. Great, thanks. ", "Lori Barker", "Next question, please. ", "Operator", "And we will go next to Daniel Berenbaum at Cowen & Company.", "Daniel Berenbaum - Cowen & Company", "Thanks for taking my call. I just wanted to get a little more clarity around the cost reductions and the restructuring. So you said, Judy, you mentioned that your OpEx for calendar \u201909 all-in will be about $800 million. How do you think that evolves over the course of the year? And then a similar question on the gross margin -- you talked about product gross margin staying negative through Q109, if I caught that correctly. Can you tell me what you think your cost reductions are going to be? I mean, there\u2019s some things you can control and some things you can\u2019t. Of the things you can control, how do you think about your products, gross margin, and cost reductions over the next few quarters?", "Judy Bruner", "Okay, so I think there\u2019s three questions there. On the expenses over the course of next year, again I said that we expect to enter 2009 at the lower expense run-rate. There will of course be seasonality in our expenses as there typically have been but we expect to enter at the lower rate. ", "In terms of gross margins for next year, I said that we currently expect gross margins may be negative into the first half of 2009. In terms of cost reductions, product cost reductions, I would expect that our cost reductions in Q4 will be somewhat better than they were in Q3 because we will have a higher mix of 43-nanometer products in the products that we are selling. But of course, the pricing is clearly a big factor in terms of what gross margins turn out to be, as are the level of inventory reserves that we may have to take. And the inventory reserves at the end of any given quarter are really primarily driven by our outlook for pricing in the coming quarters when we expect to sell that inventory on hand. ", "But specifically to cost reductions on the product, I would expect that our cost per bit will improve somewhat better in the fourth quarter than the third quarter because of the higher mix of 43-nanometer. ", "Daniel Berenbaum - Cowen & Company", "And then could you just maybe expand that out -- what do you think your cost reduction roadmap looks like in the first half of \u201909, the product cost reduction roadmap? And then also just on Q4 OpEx, I was a little bit unclear how much restructuring you expect in there in that guide that you gave. ", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "With respect to cost reductions in 2009, earlier at the analyst day in 2008 we had indicated that our cost reductions on a per gigabyte basis would be in the range of 40% to 50%. At this point we expect our cost reduction capability in 2009 to be towards the high-end of that range and of course, that\u2019s enabled by our, the large economies of scale, our technology transitions, our transition to 43-nanometer as well as 3 bit per cell transition that will be occurring during the course of next year. ", "Judy Bruner", "In terms of your question on the Q408 expenses, I did not quantify the amount of the restructuring. We have not finalized yet our restructuring actions and so I don\u2019t want to put a range on that number but we expect it will be covered by the $250 million to $260 million OpEx number that I gave for Q4. ", "Daniel Berenbaum - Cowen & Company", "Okay, thanks very much. ", "Lori Barker", "Thanks. Next caller, please. ", "Operator", "And we will go next to Jim Covello at Goldman Sachs.", "Analyst for Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs", "This is Kate [Kudlarsky] for Jim Covello. My question is on supply/demand as you look into 2009. It seems like even given the significant capacity reductions, the industry players, including yourselves, supply/demand may not actually come into balance next year, absent any new killer app. And obviously solid state drives have been the one killer app that people have been talking about and obviously we won\u2019t see significant adoption next year but I was just curious to get your views on what you think the hurdles are, aside from just price, to really get your customers to start adopting solid state drives in a more meaningful way. Thank you. ", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "With respect to the solid state disk drives in a more meaningful way, the most important thing is to have a product that has the right specifications and the right price points to drive wider adoption of solid state disk drives. As you know, we are on our first generation of MLC products that we plan to bring out in the 2009 timeframe. And in 2010/2011 timeframe is when we will have 32-nanometer, the second generation MLC SLDs and that\u2019s when we think that the price points for the SLD market get attractive enough to really drive a stronger growth in that segment. ", "In general with respect to the demand/supply balance that you earlier were also asking about, clearly the economic conditions are dictating and clouding somewhat the demand outlook. On the supply side, of course, as Eli referred to, there have been several actions taken by the competitors but of course very significantly by us as announced today in terms of managing the growth of supply, the incoming supply during next year. And we expect that by the second-half of next year, demand and supply should get better in balance. ", "Analyst for Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you and just a quick question on your bit growth expectations for 2009 -- how has your outlook changed given the announcement today and do you have an updated number that maybe you can give us for next year?", "Judy Bruner", "We really think it\u2019s too early to give an updated range for bit growth for 2009. We want to see how Q4 unfolds before we give that guidance but we do expect that within any reasonable range of bit growth for 2009, that we will be able to work down our inventory balances and that we will need that inventory in order to meet demand in 2009, and that will be a good thing in terms of our balance sheet. ", "Eli Harari ", "I would like to comment that I don\u2019t think anybody from, not ourselves and I don\u2019t believe our competitors, believe that 2009 capacity overhang or inventory overhang is going to be solved in 2009 through solid state disks. It\u2019s still a very young market and really 2009 is not the year when it really takes off. However, on the positive side, there is definitely an expectation certainly by us that in 2009, the mobile environment handsets is going to be an engine of growth and a very large consumer of flash memory. This is what we have been saying for the last five years. The iPod 3G, a 16-gigabyte, is now really getting competition to come up with touch screen phones from Nokia, from Samsung Mobile, LG, and introducing third-party developer applications, introducing smartphone growth as well as social networking and of course, content downloading, as well as the slotMusic initiative that we are introducing. ", "So we think that mobile handsets, I think the number is something like 770 million handsets this year that will be sold with a slot for micro-SD or M2 card and we think that certainly what we are seeing is the capacity per micro-SD card going into that cell phone is increasing. It\u2019s approaching 3-gigabytes in retail and also over a gigabyte in bundled cards. We expect that capacity to go up. The sheer volume of handsets is really what\u2019s going to soak up a lot of the excess supply and in the second half of next year, I do believe that this is going to be the greatest factor for creating stability, supply/demand balance. ", "Of course, the biggest factor out there that none of us know is the global economy and it is like -- it\u2019s almost as difficult as predicting what the price of a barrel of oil is going to be next year. ", "Analyst for Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you very much and Judy, if I can maybe ask the bit growth question slightly differently and ask you if you didn\u2019t grow wafer starts or your capacity at all next year, what kind of bit growth could you get from just shrinks and maybe moving to higher densities?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So with respect to the restructuring that we announced today, after the restructuring the bit growth in terms of the incoming supply would be significantly less than 100%. We believe that with our captive supply, with the technology transitions and the cost-effective captive supply, as well as inventory that will be going in from 2008 into 2009, we will be able to meet most of our demand requirements through captive supply. Maybe we will need some non-captive supply late in 2009 timeframe. ", "Analyst for Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you very much. ", "Lori Barker", "Next caller, please. ", "Operator", "And we will go next to  Daniel Amir at Lazard.", "Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets", "A couple of questions here -- first of all, can you comment a bit about what the 43-nanometer mix is going to be first half of next year and kind of as we exit \u201909? I guess the 34-nanometer mix and including the X3, X4 as well?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So with respect to 43-nanometer, we have said that by the end of this year, we expect two-thirds of our bit production to be in 43-nanometer, so this will of course continue to ramp during the course of next year. In the Q1 timeframe, we would be expecting significantly above that number of 43-nanometer. The 43-nanometer transition is going extremely well. Our [inaudible] are good as well as our conversion capability to 43-nanometer has been exceptionally strong. So in that regard, it will follow the transition trends similar to 56-nanometer and maybe better, well into 2009. ", "And with regard to 3 bit per cell, our  target is to have 50% of our output with 3 bit per cell in 2009 timeframe. And with regard to the 32-nanometer, we will begin production -- we are targeting to begin production in the second half of 2009. In terms of exact mix of 32-nanometer versus 43-nanometer in 2009, we will update that later once the technology is ready for production. ", "Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets", "And the X4?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "X4, we will begin shipments of X4 in first half of next year. At this point, we are encouraged by the early results that we are seeing with the X4 technology. ", "Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets", "Thanks, and Eli, maybe a follow-up question a bit on the industry side -- I mean, do you still see the industry going with more CapEx cuts here in the next couple of quarters? Or do you think that most of the industry has already cut the 200-millimeter and already delayed some of their fabs?", "Eli Harari ", "You know, I can\u2019t speak for Toshiba or Samsung. These are the main suppliers and I guess you have to ask them that question but clearly the 200-millimeter retirement is becoming less of a factor. Really these fabs are not cost-effective and frankly not generating a lot of supply. [Some have most of the 200-millimeter capacity left] and I would assume that they would want to retire those as soon as they possibly can.", "Look, I\u2019ve said for the last three years that 60% annual price declines are not sustainable. Unfortunately, I was proven right. There\u2019s no question that 60% -- that this trend is not justifying return on investment, not delivering return on investment on new investments and the pricing really has to improve and the profitability has to return before anybody that wants to make money in this business can justify building new capacity that\u2019s not on the drawing board. ", "On the other hand, this is a young industry that has tremendous growth ahead and there\u2019s no question that new capacity will be built in the future that will return the kind of return on investment that it deserves. But I think first of all we have to work our way -- the industry really has got to work its way out of this downturn and into the next recovery. ", "Lori Barker", "Thank you. Next caller, please. ", "Operator", "And we will go next to Vijay Rakesh at Thinkpanmure.", "Vijay Rakesh - Thinkpanmure", "Just looking at the OpEx direction that you -- actually look at next -- [clearly I guess] you are running at 20%, 25% OpEx range. What do you think it could be for 2009, just ballpark?", "Judy Bruner", "We\u2019re not very prepared to give that percentage because then clearly we\u2019d be giving a revenue number for 2009 and we\u2019re not ready to give a revenue range for 2009 at this point. ", "I will tell you that the OpEx percent in 2009 will still be higher than we believe it should be, in terms of our long-term model but we are taking actions that we believe are quite aggressive and will cause us to make some pretty tough choices in the business. ", "Vijay Rakesh - Thinkpanmure", "Thanks. And also on the Toshiba announcement today, given the -- why is Toshiba buying that fab? And second, since you are transferring the ownership to them, will you still be sharing the out 50-50 from those fabs?", "Eli Harari ", "You would have to ask Toshiba why they are buying the fab but this is a good deal for both companies. We are selling our 30% at book value. This is a good return for us and a good return for them because it\u2019s established capacity that is in place. They have a different customer base, different usage profile than we do. ", "The important thing for us is to make sure that the 70% that remains in the joint venture, that 70% is split 50-50. The important thing for us is that costs to us of our captive supply is based on 100% of Fab 3 and Fab 4, not on 70% of the costs. So we get the full economies of scale of the entire 100% in Fab 3 and 4, even though our CapEx investments are 35% of the total capacity. ", "Vijay Rakesh - Thinkpanmure", "Got it. And one last question, X3, what percentage of output does it get to let\u2019s say by the middle of next year?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "At this point I cannot break down the middle of next year timeframe but X3, as we have said before, for 2009 in total will be about 50%, targeting to be about 50%. And in the Q4 timeframe, X3 is about 15% of our total output, so we will of course continue to ramp this during the course of 2009. ", "Vijay Rakesh - Thinkpanmure", "Got it. Thanks a lot, guys. ", "Lori Barker", "Next caller, please. ", "Operator", "And we will go next to Gary Hsueh at Oppenheimer & Company.", "Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Company", "First question, just looking at the Toshiba balance sheet, not the prettiest balance sheet. Is the deal with Toshiba dependent on any external financing that you know of?", "Judy Bruner", "No, there are no contingencies in the MOU in terms of financing. Of course relative to the half of the value that relates to relief from operating leases, both parties, SanDisk and Toshiba, will need to work with the relevant banks to transfer those operating leases. ", "Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Company", "Okay, thanks. And assuming you do get those operating leases transferred over, to me by my math, half of that $1 billion savings, half of that would seem to translate to 19% or 20% cost reduction on the COGS line. If you look at the cost curve for 2009 and I know you guys have talked about 60% ASP declines year over year being a not sustainable sort of situation for the industry, assuming that happens again to the industry in 2009, when you look at things like this divestiture of your captive capacity to Toshiba, how much can you close that gap, assuming that there is another 60% decline in pricing next year?", "Judy Bruner", "Well let me try to clarify the way that the operating leases work, because I am not sure your calculation matches the way they work. The operating leases are really used to pay for the equipment over typically about a  five-year schedule, so the operating leases that will be transferred, depending on what equipment they relate to, will likely have several years of life left on them and that amount is essentially amortized to COGS over the remaining life of the operating lease. There\u2019s a quarterly pay-down schedule on the operating leases. ", "Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Company", "Okay, I think I was a little aggressive on the schedule there of that payment but just in terms of the cost curve in 2009, what are the major levers and what do you think are the respective contribution from those levers in qualitative or quantitative terms?", "Eli Harari ", "So let me try -- first your earlier question about another year of 60% price decline, I think that we cannot really tell what the price decline is going to be but if there\u2019s one thing that the announcement that we announced today, the MOU, does is that if it gets really that bad or really that ugly, we have the balance sheet to survive that kind of environment and that was really -- this is a very, very important factor. So we have really the ability and the staying power to continue despite the cuts with strategic development programs and I believe to make it through this current downturn, even if the economic conditions, global economic conditions continue beyond what everybody expects. ", "However, the second question, where are the levers, you know, the big levers are honestly on the technology side. We already have the manufacturing economies of scale. The inventory write-downs is really a very major factor in our gross margin and clearly if we can control our inventory and I believe that today\u2019s announcement makes a big difference, that will allow us to return our gross margin, that together with the cost reductions. ", "Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Company", "Okay. I was just hoping to get a more quantitative number on what you expect cost per bit to come down in \u201909 versus \u201908 but if you can\u2019t give that number out, I can certainly understand. ", "Judy Bruner", "Well we previously said, and I think Sanjay said a few minutes ago, that we are expecting about 40% to 50% reduction in cost per bit over the 2009 and 2010 timeframe. Those are ranges we gave at our analyst day and that\u2019s a factor in our business model that we are in pretty good control of. ", "Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Company", "Okay. ", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "And I also said that in 2009, we will expect the cost reduction per bit to be more toward the high end of that range. ", "Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Company", "Okay, perfect. Thank you. ", "Lori Barker", "Next caller, please. ", "Operator", "And we will go next to Bob Gujavarty with Deutsche Bank.", "Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks for taking my question. Just to hit the inventory a little bit, I mean, if you back out the inventory write-down, I mean organically inventories would have been up a little bit. When should we start to see organically the inventories start to come down? These announcements you\u2019ve made about supply cuts, when does that start to kind of be shown on your inventory on-hand?", "Judy Bruner", "You know, it\u2019s difficult to predict what the inventory dollar amount is going to be at the end of Q4 because the reserves are clearly difficult to predict. But I would expect clearly in Q1 after we close the restructuring transaction that we will start to see a fairly significant impact on inventory. Of course, Q1 often is a seasonal quarter but I think we will start to see impact in the first quarter. ", "Also I want to point out that not all of the inventory related charges relate to inventor on-hand. Some of them relate to inventory that\u2019s in the channel as well. ", "Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, fair enough. And then the other, if you can give us any color, is there a big difference between inventory of let\u2019s say finished products like Flash cards and inventory of NAND chips, is there some kind of dynamic going on there or is it a universal inventory problem? ", "Judy Bruner", "Well, I would tell you that from Q2 to Q3, we saw a decrease in our finished goods and our work-in-process. Our raw material balance as the incoming raw components went up from Q2 to Q3. ", "Eli Harari ", "But at the fundamental manufacturing level, obviously you want to keep your inventory as much as possible at the die level so that you don\u2019t invest in what we call transformation costs, particularly you don\u2019t build products that may not be what the customer wants. So our Shanghai facility is very large scale and is geared more and more towards giving us the flexibility to build the right products with very fast cycle time so that we can postpone transforming die into finished products as late as possible, and that is something we are focused in 2009.", "Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks, fair enough. And just a final question, and it may be too long to answer right now but there used to be a lot of talk about being able to differentiate your products. Now just from what I hear, it\u2019s all the focus on costs. Is differentiation pretty much -- people don\u2019t pay for differentiation, is that the fundamental view now of the NAND market? ", "Eli Harari ", "Not exactly -- we do think that we have a brand preference. However, the way it\u2019s translated now is if we matched the price, we get the business more often than not because for the same price, people recognize that we have not just a better brand but also better quality through vertical integration. We also have the Ultra and Extreme products and we do have market segmentation, differentiation. However, the majority of the product, USB flash drives and our Blue label, are really driven very much by price and we have to meet the price in order to get the sale. ", "Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks, guys. ", "Lori Barker", "I\u2019m sorry but we\u2019ll only have time for one more call -- the next caller, please. ", "Operator", "And we will go next to  Tristan Gerra at Robert Baird.", "Analyst for Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird", " ", "This is Scott [Herleman] calling in for Tristan. I have a couple of quick questions on the CapEx, the $1.3 billion -- how should we think about that being split between wafer increases versus conversions and then also how is it split SanDisk internal versus fab CapEx?", "Judy Bruner", "The vast majority of it is related to technology transitions as opposed to wafer capacity expansion. And you know, I would tell you that this year, we are likely to see about $200 million, maybe a little bit higher than $200 million of non-fab related CapEx and so you can assume that that number is flattish or slightly down within the 1.3 next year. ", "Analyst for Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, that makes sense. Thanks for that. And there was kind of an interesting comment that you guys had put in the press release about that you can pay up to 50% of the CapEx in the J.V. and I was kind of wondering what are your thoughts around that and what\u2019s the reason for that? If you do pay 50% of new CapEx, then do you increase your percent stake or what would be the reasoning behind that?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So what we said is that for the future capacity expansions, total wafer capacity expansions in the joint ventures in the fabs, we have the option to expand that capacity on a 50-50 basis. So of course, as we make those decisions, and again those decisions are to be made only in the future when the timing comes up for those expansions, if we made those expansions on a 50-50 basis, yes, I mean, our total percentage output from the fabs will go from approximately 35% toward a higher percentage level. ", "Analyst for Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, that makes sense. ", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "At this point, we have adjusted total capacity to the levels that we believe are appropriate for meeting our demand requirements in the 2009 timeframe. The good thing is we have the option to continue to expand on a 50-50 basis for future capacity as well and we will of course decide that based on our assessment of the demand drivers. ", "Analyst for Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, thanks for that. And on kind of 3D, I know we were looking at spending kind of into 2010, what\u2019s the thought on spending for 3D on the CapEx for that? Is that pushed out further? When should we actually start to see that roll through?", "Judy Bruner", "You know, we really don\u2019t have a specific plan as to significant CapEx for 3D. We expect that we will spend maybe something like $50 million within 2009 for some early 3D sort of development type of CapEx but in terms of 3D CapEx for production, it\u2019s too early at this point to say. ", "Analyst for Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, and one last quick question is -- I guess this is kind of contingent to maybe if the current agreement that you have gets moved on further with Samsung or not but when should we expect to see licensing revenues from X4 and kind of any idea about when that actually becomes a significant portion of your licensing revenues?", "Eli Harari ", "The pacing item would be of course a cost license but actually the much bigger pacing item is the ability to do X4. In practical terms, we think that we are significantly ahead of the rest of the industry, we and Toshiba are significantly ahead of the rest of the industry. So I think certainly it would not be a 2009 event. I\u2019d be shocked if somebody had an X4 product that was competitive in the market any time in 2009, other than what we are talking about. ", "Analyst for Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird", "And do any of your current licensing agreements outside of your ones with Toshiba cover X4? Maybe the Hynix agreement that you announced or any of the other agreements that you have?", "Eli Harari ", "I don\u2019t remember what we said but these agreements are confidential and we normally do not disclose what each one of them cover the other side, unless the other side agrees, so I really cannot comment on that. Because as I said, in practical terms, we have been developing through end-systems initially the X4 technology for the last really five years and we are getting to the point now that we can actually -- we\u2019re getting ready to implement it industry first next year and I think that our competitors are significantly behind. ", "Analyst for Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. Well, thank you very much. ", "Eli Harari ", "So I think we need to conclude this session. Really I want to say that as you can see, we are building our business for the future, we are adapting to the near term realities, we are taking the appropriate steps and these are very strong steps proactively to sharpen our focus, definitely strengthen our balance sheet and I again very strongly believe that SanDisk will emerge stronger in the next recovery. ", "So thank you very much and we will see you I guess in January. There\u2019s going to be a new President by that time. All right. Thank you. Goodbye.

I would like to mention, as we begin that we will be making forward-looking statements on our comments and in response to your questions concerning our business model, our ongoing research and development investments, our potential extension and for the gaming market, demand in the hard drive industry for the December quarter, cost improvements from our media operations, fiscal 2009 capital expenditures, use of our cash, seasonality of the hard drive industry and our financial outlook for the December quarter, including our revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, net interest expense, tax rate, share count and earnings per share expectations.", "These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-K filed with the SEC on August 20, 2008, as well as the additional risk factors reported in the press release included as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 8-K we furnished to the SEC today.", "We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect [new] information or events, and you should not assume later in the quarter that the comments that we make today are still valid.", "I also want to note that copies of the remarks from today\u2019s call will be available on the Investor Relations section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of this call.

I am pleased to report that WD again delivered solid, profitable growth in the first quarter, in an environment of subdued demand. ", "Looking at the WD served markets for 2.5-inch and 3.5-inch ATA hard drives in the September quarter, and including the Seagate's 14th week. The market grew 15%, both year-on-year and sequentially. ", "However, we believe that a comparison based on 13 weeks is more useful, in trying to understand the impact of current macroeconomic conditions on seasonal market demand.

Could you let us know which segments are the biggest drop in build plan versus your prior expectations for the December quarter?", "Tim Leyden", "David, I think we continue to project pretty robust demand for the 2.5-inch segment, and somewhat more subdued demand profile in the 3.5-inch areas.", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "And then for the December quarter, actually on the CapEx side. Can you talk about your priorities for CapEx this year and whether you expect it to be more front-end and back-end loaded?", "John Coyne", "Our focus as far CapEx is concerned is to focus on flexibility, so that we can build what we need to build as close as possible to demand requirement. And we believe that that's a better choice rather than building inventory linearly in advance.", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. Your line is open.", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Thank you. Good afternoon. First, when you look at your branded share relative to what the market's doing, can you comment on what you think the branded may do here in the December quarter and how you are positioning yourself for that?", "John Coyne", "Sure. We had a very good last quarter from a share and volume perspective. We grew significantly. We did grow rapidly in our 2.5-inch segment which accounts for the flat quarter-over-quarter revenue, which reflects the lower ASPs of 2.5-inch in general in that environment. ", "As we look forward into the coming quarter, we continue to see good traction in the external storage market. As I've said many times on these calls, we see this as one the under-appreciated areas for total storage demands, and so far it's exhibiting good strength in current macro environment.", " ", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Then when you were talking about inventories being closely managed, were you referring to this space or was it broader than that to OEMs?", " ", "John Coyne", "We are managing, but we've managed every piece of inventory, whether it's raw material, work in process or own finished goods, the level in the channel whether component or retail. We manage it all.", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay. Secondly, on the overall plans, because you are now number one in notebook shares, I believe you are number one in retail as well. Where do you see, given the current environment, WD's greatest opportunities for growth over the next 12 months?", " ", "John Coyne", "Well I think, being number one in the two fastest growth market segment within the total industry is very good positioning, and continuing to rollout leadership products in those spaces, which we absolutely intend to do, and we currently have a very good position. I feel very good about that. ", "As we look at the rest of the current product portfolio, the fundamentals of the quality and availability and the high value low-cost capability that will give us strength in continuing to address those existing markets for which we have product lines. ", "We then have opportunity in unserved markets today; the traditional enterprise market which we\u2019ve indicated that we are well along the process of investing in the underlying technologies and product portfolio to address that market in the future.", "We look at opportunity, as I mentioned in my remarks, we\u2019re looking at the opportunity in the gaming market given our industry leading cost position. We see it as a competitive but attractive market space. ", "And likewise, in the netbook market as it unfolds is clearly demonstrating a preference for the incorporating of hard drives into those systems. ", "Probably when the dust settles through the December quarter, we\u2019re probably going to be somewhere in the 70% to 80% netbook being shift with hard drives. And we see that also, as an attractive incremental market to our core markets.", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay. Lastly, on the overall market. Do you think that the December quarter is the crossover point for when notebook HDDs are shipped more than desktop 3.5-inch, or do you think there is still enough branded consumption of 3.5-inch to last for a little bit?", "John Coyne", "It will be in the current fiscal year in my view. Whether it\u2019s by the end of December, who knows? We don't much care; our fundamental investments in technology address all markets, our investments in manufacturing infrastructure and operations and supply base also are highly leveraged in terms of their ability to be used for either form factor. So, we are very comfortable about being able to respond to whatever rate of change there is as those volumes cross over.", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Thank you very much and well done.", "John Coyne", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Mark Moskowitz with JPMC. Your line is open.", "Mark Moskowitz - JPMC", "Yes. Thank you. Good Afternoon. Two questions please. The first, can you just help us out. It's kind of a loaded question, but I am just trying to reconcile your comments relative to your peer's comments yesterday. When they said they stepped into the fog that they are concerned about the macro, but yet October is kind of seen or exhibiting its usual buzz, where as you are saying you have already seen subdued demand and weakness. Can you kind of just help us understand the puts and takes behind that?", "John Coyne", "Sure. In September, we saw demand not stepping up to meet the same level of seasonal up-tick that was typical of a September in a Q1. And that's probably the first large manifestation of the impact of the current macroeconomic environment. ", "We see that carrying over to a degree into October, and our expectations for outbound products, that people are managing their inventories more closely right throughout the chain. ", "People are recognizing that in these kind of environments cash is king, and utilizing their cash and their credit lines to support velocity rather than to support inventory is the right use of their resources. ", "Therefore, we are seeing lead times shortening, leaving the decision making on what to buy and when to buy it until they were looking at the demand side of that equation. ", "The numbers are still good; you've have seen our guidance, we are looking at flat revenues which implies volume increase. I think, Tim you said 5% on a sequential basis. ", "We are still expecting market growth, one of the few markets to exhibit growth in these times. So I don't think we are inconsistent at all with what Seagate would have said.", " ", "Mark Moskowitz - JPMC", "Okay, thank you. Secondly, they believe they have done a great job in terms of reflecting the operating model consistently with respect to the operating metrics. ", "I want to get a sense of how flexible you are if we do see a really subdued demand environment over the next couple of quarters. Clearly, some of the external suppliers out there are going some difficulties. ", "Would you be more apt to leverage TDK in terms of them being stuck in a position and to try to volume, or maybe you would source your head's more externally if you get some good price breaks there?", " ", "John Coyne", "I think the answer is more about how we closely manage inventories, and that\u2019s not just in our own shop and in finished goods. That\u2019s also looks backwards into the supply chains and the signal for getting in to the supply chain and the level which we are getting them dressed up to go to the party. ", "Therefore, we manage that entire supply chain footprint, both well and closely. I think our supply chain partners are all pretty much aligned with our plan, and our supply chain, because it\u2019s routinely exercised along that model, tends to respond faster to the environment once they get our signals. ", "As to moving our sourcing model; no, we have a pretty well established, long term, strategic sourcing model that addresses particularly technology partners for the value they bring to us in assurance of execution on the introduction of new products and new aerial density points. That's the value they bring to our party. Our internal manufacturing brings the fundamental low cost value.", "Mark Moskowitz - JPMC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum Capital Group, your line is open.", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital Group", "Thanks. Our recent checks have suggested that Seagate, which has been very aggressive in pricing the last few quarters, became a little bit more reasonable with pricing towards the end of the September quarter, and so far in the quarter has continued to be a little bit more reasonable than they say they were, 10, 12 weeks ago. Would you say that you have seen that as well?", "John Coyne", "Current price level from the industry, we certainly have seen pretty significant takedowns over the last three quarters on a quarter-by-quarter basis. ", "There is the question of how long our competitors can continue to make such poor returns on their investments, by limiting those returns through very aggressive pricing.

I do know that in the environment over the last three quarters and the environment we anticipate for the current quarter, Western Digital continues to deliver the kind of industry leading results that we have demonstrated today. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital Group", "Fabulous. Could you give us any thoughts on all the rumors regarding consolidation in the industry and what your thoughts are?", "John Coyne", "Well, you know our long-standing policy is not to comment on such rumors. The history of the industry suggest that in times like these, where demand falls below the traditional demand curve for a period of time that pressure is put on the weaker participants and this tends to result in consolidation. ", "Again, we don't believe that consolidation is necessary. We make a very nice living in the business with the business model we've developed, but it could be beneficial.", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital Group", "One last question. Just on the component side, and running very lean inventories I think in your prepared comments you said that you were running raw materials and components at very lean at four weeks versus six weeks. Did I hear that correctly?", "John Coyne", "Not quite. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital Group", "Okay.", "John Coyne", "The commentary I made on inventory was that our finished goods inventory is flat both sequentially and year-over-year as a percent of sales, our channel inventories of the component distribution channel is in the low end of our four to six week range. ", "But if you take Tim\u2019s commentary on overall inventory at 14 turns, we consistently carry the lowest inventory in the industry at the highest velocity, and therefore have the highest ability to respond to change and opportunity.", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital Group", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Sherri Scribner with Deutsch Bank. Your line is open.", " ", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsch Bank", "Hi, thank you. About the ASP decline this quarter. Could you maybe give a little bit of detail on where pricing was most aggressive? Was it again 2.5 inch which we've seen for a while or did you see pricing get more aggressive in 3.5-inch? ", "And as part of that in the December quarter, you mentioned that you would expect to see some degradation in ASPs. Would you expect similar levels down to 5% to 6% which we saw this quarter, and Seagate sort of suggested we see similar, but some color on that would also be helpful?", "Tim Leyden", "We saw competitive pricing right across the board. For the 3.5's a little more than 2.5's, and we anticipate that in the December quarter, because all competitors at this stage pretty much have ready availability almost right across the product lineup. ", "We expect that it will be competitive and again at the high-end of what we would normally see or above the high-end of what we would normally see in a December quarter.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsch Bank", "Are you seeing a negative mix in your product profile in terms of drives that are addressing the network market, are you seeing a shift down? Also how is demand for high capacity drives right now?", "Tim Leyden", "Demand for high capacity is good. Certainly the network is kind of by definition a low capacity player, a lower (inaudible) context. The range of low capacities is from 80 to 160 gigabytes. And so, we are seeing a pretty good mix across the entire business. ", "As we've continued to grow the business, we\u2019ve been mixing down, because of our initial strength in the very high capacities when we had them and nobody else could produce them. ", "So, as the other folks have come to the table, with the 250 gig capacity points and then the 320 gig capacity points, our overall mix has become more reflective of the total market demand.

Scott Craig with Bank of America, your line is open.", "Scott Craig - Bank of America ", "Thanks, good afternoon. With regards to the gross margin guidance for the December quarter, can you give us the pushes and pulls on it, on a quarter-over-quarter basis. How you see that playing out? ", "And then secondly, in the 2.5-inch notebook space, do you still feel that there are opportunities on a sequential basis over the next couple of quarters to gain share, or do you think you will be ceding share there as some of the other players have some more competitive products coming out in that space?", "Tim Leyden", "Okay. As far as the December, gross margin, the December quarter gross margin is concerned, and I think the big push will be on supply demand balance. Consequently, I think there is enough supply out there. People have comparable products across the range. So, we expect that there will be pretty competitive pricing. ", "We will combat that through cost and efficiency and utilization, and by being selective in how we approach the different pockets of weakness and pockets of strength. And so, we think it will be pretty much as it has been in the past.", "Scott Craig - Bank of America ", "I think in your 2.5-inch question, the position there we believe share is a result of customer activity and how the customer perceive the value that we are offering. ", "John Coyne", "To date, our customers have been demonstrating that they are very happy with the value proposition that Western Digital brings, whether it be in high capacity drives, whether it be in availability on demand, superior quality, in our ability to continually reinvest in future technologies, future product breadth, significant high performance capacity and the development of the ongoing supply chain.", "These are all things that our customers look at in making the decision of where they place their business. Price is one element. But we believe we have a very strong portfolio, right across the board, but a particularly strong portfolio in the 2.5-inch environment where we have been very focused over the last five years in building our current position.

A couple of follow-up questions: On the CapEx side in particular, of the $600 million that\u2019s not related to the wafer fab, is there any way we can break that down to understand better where the spending is going?

Any granularity on what the 600 actually should be looked at as?", "John Coyne", "Yeah, we\u2019ve been pretty specific about what our CapEx model is. It\u2019s in the 7% of revenue region, and we are continuing to execute our business.

Baird", "Operator", "Welcome to Western Digital's second quarter financial results for fiscal year 2009.", "(Operator Instructions).", "Now I'll turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.", "Bob Blair", "Thank you. I want to mention as we begin that we will be making forward-looking statements on our comments and in response to your questions concerning demand in the hard drive industry; reductions in our expense and operation structure; our business restructuring plan and the associated impact on our ability to maintain operating expense, align capacity with demand and improve structural costs and gross margin range; the expected size, type and timing of charges and future original savings associated with our business restructuring plan; our ability to deliver industry-leading performance; market opportunities for high-capacity storage; our future investments; repurchases of our stock and management of our cash; goodwill impairment charges; our gross margin model cost structure and ability to remain profitable and cash flow positive; demand in pricing in the hard drive industry for the March quarter; and our financial results expectations for the March quarter, including revenue and gross margin, expenses, share count, restructuring costs and earnings per share.", "These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on October 31, 2008, as well as the additional risk factors reported in the press release included as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 8-K we furnished to the SEC today. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events, and you should not assume later in the quarter that the comments that we make today are still valid.", "In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP financial measures in our press release included as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 8-K that we furnished to the SEC today, a copy of which can be found under the SEC filings link in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.westerndigital.com.", "I'd also like to note that copies of remarks from today's call by John Coyne and Tim Leyden will be available on the Investor section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of this call.", "And now I will turn the call over to President and CEO of Western Digital, John Coyne.", "John Coyne", "Thanks, Bob. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today.", "In our last conference call, in October 2008, we were coming off a weak September quarter. And accordingly, in contrast to historical norms of 7% to 10% quarter-on-quarter growth, we provided what we believe was muted guidance for the December quarter of approximately 5% unit growth in our served markets for 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch ATA drives.", "However, as the quarter developed, we saw unprecedented macroeconomic conditions depress these already muted expectations with demand actually declining 14% sequentially, transforming the December quarter into one of the most challenging ever for WD and the entire hard drive industry.", "Instead of the 138 million units in served market demand which we expected, we saw a decline in industry shipments to 113 million, a negative swing of 25 million hard drives. The timing of this sudden demand shift gave us and others in the hard drive industry just two months to react and adjust. This rapid fall off in demand, amplified by customer inventory adjustments, further intensified the highly competitive pricing environment we experienced throughout calendar 2008.", "As we saw demand fall off dramatically in early November, we acted swiftly to align our production volumes and operating expenses, demonstrating the benefits of a well-coordinated, capable and committed team executing to a proven, fast, flexible and responsive business playbook. Our response yielded positive results and comparative profitability, cash generation, asset management and increased customer preference.", "While pleased with the performance of the team and the business model and addressing short term conditions, our assessment was that this was not just a one quarter anomaly, but rather a demand level reset, which would become the new base line for demand throughout calendar 2009.", "Consequently, we developed and put in motion a plan which resizes our expense and operational structure to a revenue expectation for calendar 2009, some 25% below what we achieved in calendar 2008.", "The details of this plan, which involved headcount, compensation, and work hour reductions across all areas of the company. As well as closure of facilities in both our component and hard drive manufacturing operations were outlined in the form 8-K, we filed with the SEC on December 17, 2008.", "These actions, which we expect to complete within the March quarter, are designed to maintain our operating expense in the range of 9% to 11% of revenues at the $1.5 billion level.", "The resizing of production capacity through work hour and headcount reductions, facility closures and equipment retirement is designed to align capacity more closely with our perception of ongoing demand, improve our structural cost and move our spec towards our business model gross margin range of 18% to 23%.", "The hard drive is a high technology commodity. The critical factors for success in this market are consistent high quality and reliability, large scale and low cost, focused asset management, effective technology deployment, product's breadth, and product availability.", "WD's consistent and profitable growth over the last seven years demonstrates our understanding of these key factors. And our ability to deliver industry-leading performance across all of them, while executing within the financial model I outlined earlier.", "We are focused on continuing to deliver outstanding customer value through consistent execution against this simple yet effective model.", "Operating expense averaging 10% of revenue over the last five years has enabled expansion of our worldwide sales and support operations, which has extended our ability to bring outstanding products to customers in every corner of the globe. It has funded the development of industry leading component technologies in heads and media to underpin our customer value proposition.", "And it has allowed us to develop a broad and diversified product portfolio serving the majority of the available ATA hard drive and external storage markets, while also funding significant engineering activity in preparation for our entry into the traditional enterprise market.", "We continue to demonstrate the effectiveness of these controlled and focused investments through the technology deployments and product shipments we have announced since our last conference call.", "In the December quarter, we believe that we shipped more 500 gigabyte, 2.5 inch hard drives than all five of our competitors combined and shipped twice as many as our nearest competitor.", "We brought the fundamental technology and system design to market at roughly the same time as key competitors. However, it is the entire recipe of our approach to new product introduction and ramp that is evident in this level of market acceptance and our financial results. The ingredients include our process technology and new product deployment and our refinement of yield, utilization, cost and supply chain logistics as we ramp into production, all the while maintaining the industry's leading quality and reliability metrics and lowest warranty expense.", "This week, we began volume shipment of another industry-first, the 2-terabyte WD Caviar Green 3.5-inch hard drive, employing our advanced 400 gigabit per square inch aerial density technology allied to our unique second-generation WD GreenPower energy-saving technology.", "This same 2-terabyte drive will also power a new capacity point in our My Book line of personal storage products and enables an 8-terabyte capacity in our WD ShareSpace enhanced product line for home server, media center and small business applications.", "In our branded group, we launched several new Mac products during the quarter, including the My Passport Studio with FireWire 800 connectivity, the My Passport for Mac in 320-gigabyte and 500-gigabyte capacities and the My Book Mac edition at 1 terabyte.", "We also entered an entirely new branded product category with the launch of the WD TV HD Media Player, a device that allows easy playback from any USB storage device of music, photos and video directly on to televisions in full 1080p HD format. This is the first in a line of WD branded products designed to bring users' media content out of the home office and into the family room with a simple and elegant PC-free interface.", "Tim Leyden will now provide our detailed report on the December quarter, our resizing and our outlook. Tim?", "Tim Leyden", "As John described, unprecedented macroeconomic conditions made the December quarter a challenging one for WD and the entire hard drive industry. Nevertheless, in the face of these challenges, the WD team took swift action to reduce expenses, cut production capacity and minimize working capital investments.", "As we enter the quarter, we have expected sequential quarterly unit growth of about 5%, at the low end of historical seasonal trends. Instead, we had to make course corrections during the quarter to respond to a decline in our total served market unit demand of approximately 14%, and desktop and notebook markets each declined about the same percentage.", "Our revenue for the second fiscal quarter was $1.8 billion, down 17% from the prior year. Hard drive revenue is down 13% from the prior year and 14% sequentially. Shipments totaled 35.5 million units, up 4% from the prior year, but down 10% sequentially. Average hard drive selling price was approximately $51, down $2 from the September quarter and $10 from the year-ago quarter.", "Our Q2 ASP reflects a very competitive pricing environment as a result of all competitors having anticipated more robust demand and consequently having too much supply available for the demand that materialized.", "For the December quarter, we saw sequential declines in desktop, notebook and enterprise data unit shipments. We experienced the first Q1 to Q2 decline in 2.5-inch drive market demand since entering the notebook market in September 2004. Our unit shipments of 2.5-inch drives were 13.8 million in the December quarter as compared to 14.6 in the September quarter and 8.7 million in the year-ago quarter.", "On the plus side, shipments of consumer electronics and branded products were up sequentially. We shipped 4.1 million 3.5-inch drives for use in digital video recorders in the December quarter as compared to 3.9 in the September quarter and 4.1 million in the year-ago quarter. And revenue from sales of branded products increased 5% from Q1 and 10% from the year-ago quarter to $403 million.", "Hard drive channel revenue was 57% OEM, 21% distribution and 22% branded products in the December quarter compared with 56%, 26% and 18% in the September quarter and 48%, 34% and 18% in the year-ago quarter respectively. There was one customer, namely Dell, which comprised more than 10% of total revenue.", "The Q2 geographic split of our hard drive revenue was 23% Americas, 29% Europe and 48% Asia as compared to 23%, 29% and 48% in the September quarter and 32%,32% and 36% in the year-ago quarter. Demand strength in Asia continues to be driven by the concentration of global manufacturing in that region.", "Our gross margin for the quarter was 15.9% versus 20.1% in the September quarter and 23.3% in the year-ago quarter. Our December gross margin was impacted by the decline in overall market demand and the resulting competitive pricing pressures and factory under utilization.", "Our media operations continue to perform as expected. And we have achieved the 300 basis point cost saving objective outlined at the time of our acquisition.", "Total operating expense of $274 million included $113 million of charges associated with the restructuring plan announced on December 17. Excluding these restructuring charges, total on R&D and SG&A was $161 million for the December quarter, $29 million less than the September quarter.", "Our quarterly operating expense benefited from the reversal of variable compensation incentives amounting to $16 million that had been accrued in the September quarter and the absence of similar accruals in the December quarter and a $6 million insurance recovery.", "Our resizing plan includes the closure of one of our hard drive manufacturing facilities in Thailand; one of our substrate manufacturing facilities in Malaysia and headcount reductions throughout the world. We expect the plan to be implemented by the end of March, 2009.", "Planned headcount reductions are about 7%, combined with attrition of 6%, should result in total headcount reduction of about 6500 by the end of March. And combined with work hour reductions of about 7%, the result should be about a 20% reduction in total capacity.", "The total cost of the restructuring is currently expected to be approximately $140 million, $113 million of which has been recorded in operating expenses for the December quarter.", "The total cash utilized by the resizing actions is expected to be approximately $60 million, most of which will be spent in the March quarter.", "There were no material cash expenditures related to the restructuring in the December quarter, annual savings from these actions are expected to be approximately $150 million.", "Operating income was $16 million or 0.9% of revenue, including the $113 million restructuring charge. Excluding the restructuring charge, operating income on a non-GAAP basis was $129 million or 7.1% of revenue.", "Interest and other non-operating expenses were approximately $9 million. This includes about $6 million of unrealized losses on our previously-disclosed investments in auction-rate securities. These investments totaled $19 million at the end of the quarter.", "The company recorded a net tax benefit from the December quarter of $7 million. This consists of a tax provision of $6 million offset by a $6 million tax benefit related to the extension of the R&D tax credit, which was enacted into law in October 2008 and a $7 million favorable adjustment of previously recorded tax accruals to reflect the change in the company's outlook for future income before taxes.", "Net income totaled $14 million, or $0.06 per share, excluding the $113 million restructuring charge and the related tax benefit of $4 million, non-GAAP net income was $123 million or $0.55 per share.", "Turning to the balance sheet, our cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter totaled $1.4 billion as compared to $1.2 billion at the end of September. We generated $300 million in cash flow from operations during the December quarter.", "Capital expenditures for the December quarter were $140 million and our non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization expense totaled $122 million.", "Capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 are expected to be about $500 million. This is consistent with the update we gave on December 17, when we announced the significant reduction from our prior forecast of $750 million.", "Depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2009 is expected to be about $480 million. We did not repurchase any shares of stock during the December quarter. We believe that in times of economic uncertainty and tightness of credit, the robust cash balance is an important strength. We will continue to manage our cash accordingly during these certain economic times.", "As of the end of December we had 46 days of receivables outstanding, 27 days of inventory or 14 turns and 64 days of payables. This resulted in a cash conversion cycle of 9 days.", "In accordance with the accounting rules prescribed by FAS 142, we reviewed the value of our goodwill and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of quarter end. This review must be done annually or whenever events or changes and circumstances indicate that goodwill maybe impaired. It is possible that an impairment charge under the FAS 142 rules will occur in future quarters.", "Before I discuss the March quarter, I would like to make a few comments about our stated business model.", "As John indicated, we continue to believe that an 18% to 23% gross margin model is appropriate given our level of vertical integration, the amount of investments in capital and R&D required continuing to provide the products demanded in the market place and to generate an appropriate return for our shareholders.", "As outlined in the restructuring plan, we have resized our cost structure with the objective of remaining profitable and cash flow positive at a $1.5 billion quarterly revenue run rate. The critical remaining pieces of the equation are balanced supply-demand environment and a product and segment mix that will support the revenue level commensurate with the value we are delivering.", "I want to once again remind you that WD will have a 14-week quarter in this fiscal year, and we will include that extra week in our fourth fiscal quarter that will end on July 3rd, 2009.", "Now I will discuss our expectations for the third quarter of our fiscal year 2009. First, let me outline the market situation as we see it. Historically, the March quarter's sequential unit decline has been in the range of 0 to minus 8%. Global macroeconomic conditions remain challenging and the outlook in our industry and the PC industry narrows that. With demand visibility continuing to be limited, credits continuing to be tight for our customers and inventory rationalization continuing throughout all channels, we envisage that these conditions will continue to render historical demand patterns less meaningful through the rest of this calendar year.", "As a result, we are modeling a quarter-on-quarter sequential market unit reduction of approximately 13%. We believe that in a commodity marketplace such as ours, this balancing of supply and demand continues to be critical, and we are still seeking to find that equilibrium as an industry. So we anticipate that pricing will continue to be competitive.", "The capacity realignments undertaken by the 3.5-inch industry participants has led to a better balance between supply, demand and inventory holding pattern. However, in the 2.5-inch segment, the willingness of multiple competitors to operate unprofitably continues to depress prices to a level that is insufficient to sustain investment. In the branded products area, competition has intensified as competitors gravitate towards more attractive margins than those provided by comparable products in other segments.", "Taking these factors into account, we expect current quarter revenue for WD to be in the range from $1.35 billion to $1.5 billion. For comparative purposes, you should note that our fiscal Q3 revenue numbers last year included $89 million of revenue for external media sales as we fulfilled Komag's pre-acquisition and contractual obligations.", "We are modeling gross margin in a range from 14% to 14.5%. R&D and SG&A are expected to total approximately $175 million. Our net interest expense is projected to be about $4 million. We anticipate tax expense of between $5 million and $10 million for the March quarter. We anticipate our share count to be approximately flat with the December quarter. These amounts exclude remaining restructuring charges which we estimate to be about $27 million.", "This estimate may change until the date of actual disposal or completion of the restructuring plan. GAAP EPS including the restructuring charges is therefore expected to be between a loss of $0.11 and a profit of $0.02 for the March quarter. Excluding the restructuring charges, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $0.01 and $.14. The non-GAAP earnings per share are calculated using the same share count as the GAAP earnings per share.", "Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions).", "Our first question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.", "Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal", "Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I had two questions if I could. The first, Tim, for you, the $150 savings that you identified in annual savings, could you just give us a little flavor about how and when that shows up, how that unfolds? And then, particularly, how we should be thinking about COGS versus OpEx? And then I have a follow up. Thanks.", "Tim Leyden", "Yes, we anticipate that we will be at that run rate from the 1st of April and so consequently move right through the June quarter. And we'd be at that new run rate. And then on COGS versus OpEx if we look at the $150 million savings, it's about two-to-one.", "Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal", "Two-to-one.", "Tim Leyden", "Yes, two-to-one, OpEx versus COGS. Now please remember that in the June quarter, it's a 14-week quarter for us.", "Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal", "Right, fair enough. Okay. Thanks, Tim. And then my follow-up is: you have identified how much capacity that you anticipate taking out of your system? I just wonder, through your industry analysis, how much you think the industry is looking to take out of total capacity.", "John Coyne", "I think, Keith, as we indicated, we saw the industry demand come down by some 13%, 14% on a quarter-over-quarter basis into the December quarter. And we are modeling industry demand to go down another 13% into the March quarter.", "Now we are talking at ATA 3.5 and 2.5 inch combined, and our view would be that the capacity should come down by the same amount that the demand is predicted to be down if we desire to achieve that supply demand balance which is so critical to the health of this industry.", "Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal", "Right, fair enough. Okay. Thanks, guys, I see.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Shebly Seyrafi with Calyon. Your line is open.", "Shebly Seyrafi - Calyon", "Yes, thank you very much. I just want to make sure I understand this math correctly, because your headcount was reduced by 500 and something sequentially already, you targeted 2500 or so. So, I think you have 80% more to go in terms of the headcount target. Should we think about 80% of $150 million divided by four as the quarterly difference between the OpEx in the December quarter and where you going to be at the end of June?", "Tim Leyden", "Shebly, I am not sure that I understand the question and can you please --.", "Shebly Seyrafi - Calyon", "You have already reduced your headcount by 20%, I'm sorry, by 20% of the target, right? You want to reduce your headcount by 2500 and you have reduced it by 500 already, correct?", "Tim Leyden", "Yes.", "Shebly Seyrafi - Calyon", "Okay, so the $150 million annual savings, 80% of that is left, so to speak, if I look at the headcount side. And then you have divided by four. I was just trying to figure out what kind of OpEx number I should be thinking about in the September quarter of this year?", "Tim Leyden", "Okay. What we've done is we've indicated that we are citing the business to run at $1.5 billion in revenues. And our business model for OpEx has been in the 9% to 10% region when we were operating at around 2 billion, little above 2 billion, and in revenue.", "So we've been operating somewhere in the $180 million to $190 million run rate from an OpEx view point. We are going to try and get back to, as John indicated in his remarks, get back to somewhere in the 9% to 11% range and it's probably ten more towards the 10% rather than 11%. We are going to try and see if we can keep it in at that level, so consequently when you do the math of that, it will be coming somewhere between a $155 million and $165 million.", "Shebly Seyrafi - Calyon", "By the September quarter?", "Tim Leyden", "No, by the June quarter. We're going to be at that run rate from the 1st of April.", "John Coyne", "Well, that's a thirteen week run rate, yes.", "Shebly Seyrafi - Calyon", "And ask one more?", "Tim Leyden", "Again there, Shebly, let me remind you that it's a fourteen week quarter in June.", "Shebly Seyrafi - Calyon", "Yes.", "John Coyne", "So you have to flex for the fourteenth week.", "Shebly Seyrafi - Calyon", "Should we think about the March quarter with this 14% or 14.5% gross margin as a low watermark and now we should think about getting back to an 18% gross margin by the end of this year. Is that reasonable kind of expectations?", "Tim Leyden", "Well, I mean, it's back to what John mentioned about, the critical factor in gross margin, and one of the factor and possibly the most critical factor is pricing. It depends on how the industry sizes itself to match the demand. If it sizes itself to match demand, then yes, it's possible to get back to a reasonable gross margins, but until that's done, we can't forecast when that is going to happen.", "Shebly Seyrafi - Calyon", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Rich Kugele with Needham & Company, your line is open.", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Thank you and good afternoon, gentlemen. Can you just talk about what you are seeing in terms of channel conditions? Obviously, that segment is primarily 3.5 inch ATA, but it seems people have been acting a little better there. See if you could comment on that?", "Tim Leyden", "Yes, well that's what I indicated in my comments. We are seeing that the actions that have been taken by the participants and the 3.5 inch segment are tending to firm up the actual situation between inventory, supply and demand and we are beginning to see the firming up of pricing in that particular segment.", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "There are a lot of indications that overall channel inventories, and even if you look at your own balance sheet and Seagate's balance sheet, the lowest levels I've certainly ever seen. Do you feel that now, after two quarters, I must say, we are down 13%, after two quarters with that type of decline, has the industry gone too far? Will too much capacity be coming offline or is the capacity that is coming offline, primarily 3.5 inch, and it kind of sets the stage for your expansion, more in the 2.5 inch in the second half?", "John Coyne", "Well, Rich, this is John. Visibility into demand still remains somewhat, okay and cloudy, but the way we're thinking about it, yes, there has been significant reduction in inventories in the channel, particularly in 3.5-inch. In WD's case, we have taken 1.2 million units out of the channel on a quarter-over-quarter basis end of December versus end of September.", "As you can see, with our 14 turns, we're managing our internal inventory in the way that we always manage it, very well matched to the demand. However, there are some elements of concern that I have. I look at our own restructuring plan, and one of the outcomes of that is that we have enough unutilized PCs in our business to last us for some considerable time into the future, because we have to let go the users of those PCs.", "We therefore are looking at all of the headcount reductions that are happening on a worldwide basis in multiple industries. We believe that those industries are going to have the same kind of condition, and therefore, we see a further depressed demand in the commercial segment as we look forward from a PC-demand perspective. And that's a commercial PC statement, both desktop and notebook.", "As we look at the consumer space, we think that's a little less affected. There is some cannibalization effect in the traditional notebook caused by the surging popularity of lower-priced netbook offerings. The good news for us there is that the vast majority of netbooks are shipping with hard drives.", "And one of WD's forte\u00b4 is design and manufacture of very cost effective solutions to any kind of client system hard drive. So, net-net, we think that that emergence of a lower price point with a reasonable functionality that relies on a hard drive to deliver that functionality is medium to long term a good thing for us and for demand in that segment.", "Then we look at the direct external sales of drives in the retail brand of products arena where we see the cleanest demand profile of all. Demand in that segment for us was good in the December quarter. We were modestly up. I think that's a reflection of our great products, great channel partnerships. And while we expect that to diminish somewhat seasonally as it has traditionally done, we believe inventories are very well managed and the demand profile there is immediately visible. And we can react to that.", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Very helpful. I guess it's my last question. Just any thoughts on the potential Toshiba-Fujitsu merger and does this in anyway change your timing for the entrance into the enterprise?", "John Coyne", "Two answers: first, we have a long standing tradition of not commenting on rumor; and second, we continue with our investments in preparing to enter the enterprise space. And we will let you know when we are shipping product in that space.", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank, your line is open.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Hi. Thank you. Tim, I was just hoping you could go through the tax numbers again really quickly. I am just trying to understand what your normalized tax rate would be without the external, the extra external items. It seems like there was about 10 million of extra items that we won't see again. Just trying to get a number there.", "Tim Leyden", "Yes, our regular tax expense was $6 million during the course of the quarter.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. $6 million.", "Tim Leyden", "And we had the benefits of 30.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. $6 million. And then if I look at the mix of your business in the quarter, it looks like there is a lot of retail business. I can understand that from the perspective of the seasonality and the holiday sales. But I think some people would be concerned that maybe there is higher inventory levels in the retail channel. Can you maybe comment on the inventory levels in the branded products business and why that number jumped up so much?", "Tim Leyden", "Yes, I think our inventory levels in the branded products are very well in line with what we would normally expect; in fact, a little down on the prior quarter. So we're very comfortable with that.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Yes. Do those typically have higher inventory levels?", "Tim Leyden", "Yes. I think we've noted this on several of the calls, that the pipe there is a little longer than the traditional component distribution numbers. You're probably looking at components that at the end of this quarter were way down at the four-week level, or slightly below, and typically the retail pipeline runs in the eight to nine weeks. I think it is at the low end of that.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Doug Reid with Thomas Weisel Partners, your line is open.", "Doug Reid - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Thanks. Can you comments on pricing trend; in the last three weeks specifically?", "Tim Leyden", "As we indicated, again that the 3.5 inch has begun to show some signs, the beginnings of some elements are firming up, and 2.5 continues to be extremely competitive. And again, as I noted in my comments, we are seeing competition intensify also in the branded product area.", "Doug Reid - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. And then I'm wondering if you can give a little more color, where the cuts have been made within SG&A and how quickly you can restore resources you have let go of in the event, or rather when, a recovery happens?", "Tim Leyden", "Cuts have been made pretty much right across the OpEx and manufacturing areas and in the OpEx area we are dealing with it by cutting out activities and trying to stem down the number of our transactions and activities that people do.", "And we are able to operate efficiency at the current level and when we see the signs of more visibility and demand clarity coming back. We would be able to resume normal hiring type of activity. If you review our progress over the last five years, responding to upside opportunity has never been a problem for us.", "Doug Reid - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum Capital, your line is open.", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital Group", "Great, thank you, good quarter. My question, what is your capacity then, when you get done with this? Can you share with us, what your total quarterly manufacturing capacity would be?", "John Coyne", "It will be whatever the market demands from us.", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital Group", "I thought you said earlier, you'd have a total of a 20% reduction in your total capacity?", "John Coyne", "That's what we're sizing to support, as Tim mentioned, the focus of our resizing plans was to be appropriately sized to be profitable and cash positive at a $1.5 billion revenue run rate.", "Now, around that model target for the baseline of the model, again we have a fundamental business model that is quite flexible around the center line. So what we've done in the restructuring is to take our center line from 2 billion down to the 1.5 billion and then what we will do on a operational tactical basis from week-to-week as we closely monitor demand and market activity, is to respond to that appropriately. Whether that's up or down around that median line and that's how we typically run our business.", "If you look at what's different today than this time last year, I'd have to say that we're being a little more conservative and tending to be in a posture of chasing opportunity up once we've verified it, rather than getting in front of it.", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital Group", "Okay. That's fair. Can you make a comment on what you believe the capacity of the industry is today and where it may be a couple of quarters from now, and the aggregate quarterly volume? Seagate believes the industry, actually in December, before all the restructuring, was about a 160 million units a quarter, which you agree or disagree with that number and where do you think it's headed?", "John Coyne", "Yes. I think that number is the total industry number; our focus since we participate in the ATA segment, 2.5 inch and 3.5 inch ATA segment tends to be on that segment, which was 131 in September, 113 in December and we are modeling at about a 100 in the March quarter. And so we are looking at our opportunity in that light and in our sizing maintaining our share in light of those expectations for market sides.", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital Group", "Great, one last question if I may? I'm not going to comment on the rumor, if Toshiba and Fujitsu were to ever happen, but, what do you believe would be the impact to you in the industry if such a merger occurred?", "John Coyne", "I think we are more focused on how we delight customers with great products that are of high quality and reliability, address their needs, and are available at the right times and frankly, the health of the industry as we see it, relates to how the supply demand balance is managed from a build perspective. And the health of our company is derived from how much better we execute than our competitors.", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital Group", "Great. Thank you. No further questions.", "Operator", "David Bailey with Goldman Sachs, your line is open.", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "Great, thank you very much. Just in follow-up to a comment that you made earlier. How are you thinking about your mix and pricing within product lines this year in light of the shift to lower-end desktops and notebooks as well as sort of the emergence of netbooks? I mean, it definitely helps on the unit side, but doesn't this put more pricing pressure?", "John Coyne", "It potentially would put some depending on how netbooks get on through the rest of 2009 relative to other PCs and relative to the other products of the market. Potentially, it's an outcome of mixing down the overall average gigabyte shift. And as I mentioned, one of WD's forte\u00b4 is the design and manufacture of a very cost effective product. And so here we see that as an opportunity.", "Now it does put some pressure on ASPs, but on the other side of that equation, offsetting that is that the branded product retail business is moving in the opposite direction. So, as fast as the PC price point is being moved down to make it accessible to more people, the need for storage doesn't change in the use case for the customer.", "And so we expect that the attach rate of external storage to those minimally-serviced products with low-end storage devices, we see that the opportunity to attach to those with high-capacity external storage is greater than the opportunity to attach to high-capacity full-featured PCs.", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan, your line is open.", "Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan", "Thank you. Good afternoon. Two questions: More of a technology question; John, just given the macro backdrop and how you talked earlier about the oversupply of even PC, within your own environment, to the corporate PC, as happened to be quite depressible to the consumer, can we see something similar in the enterprise storage environment, where folks decide to shift more to a lower cost solution, such as SATA, a lot quicker than, maybe, a lot of us had anticipated, and move away from fiber channel over the next 12 to 18 months? How do feel positioned there if that was to occur?", "John Coyne", "Yes, I mean certainly SATA and the enterprise has been an area of significant success for us. It's an area that's been continually growing over the last several years as CIOs and their CEOs and CFOs began to focus more on the value proposition on how to service storage needs with properly-tiered cost solutions relative to performance. And that process has been going on for several years now.", "I think current economic environment accelerates more cost effective solutions and typically tiered storage that uses significant levels of enterprise SATA rather than using more expensive SAS SCSI fiber channel drives which typically are higher-price, lower-capacity, because they are primarily a performance device.", "Yes, I think we're going to see an acceleration of that deployment of lower-cost drives into the enterprise.", "Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan", "And, as a follow-up, if that acceleration does occur, would WD need to spend any more on R&D to really flush out or bolster your SATA platform or you are already there and ready to go?", "John Coyne", "We're very happy with our positioning in that market.", "Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then just lastly, I know it's kind of an old type of practice from the old days, but \u201cbundling\u201d; has there been any sort of bundling we're trying, to kind of secure business with some of the OEMs now, where you're trying to package both desktop and the notebook and maybe a low-end server drive?", "John Coyne", "I think the trends that you are seeing in the industry, and I think on an overall basis, the top three suppliers represented 77% of the industry in the December quarter compared with 73.5% in the September quarter. But I think what you are seeing is a reflection of the value proposition that the large vertically-integrated broad product line companies offer to the customers in terms of value for money, technology roadmap, long-term capability to support their products and satisfy need on into the future. And so, I think that's going to continue.", "Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Scott Craig with Banc of America, your line is open.", "Scott Craig - Banc of America", "Hi, good afternoon. Tim, can you take a look at the gross margins on a quarter-over-quarter basis and just kind of break out how much of the sequential decline was due to, say, pricing versus volumes versus anything else that you might want it from there?", "And then, John, from a 2.5-inch notebook perspective, I think you threw out some numbers there. You had more shipments than outside competitors to your nearest competitor, et cetera. So, what do you estimate your market share was in 2.5-inch from the December quarter? Thanks.", "Tim Leyden", "Okay. So, on a quarter-to-quarter pricing and margin movement, obviously pricing was by far the largest component. We once again for the fourth consecutive quarter saw prices that were higher than we had seen in comparable quarters.", "John Coyne", "Tim, sorry. Price decline?", "Tim Leyden", "Price decline; yes, in a comparable quarter. And the absorption, obviously, as we had to do with much lesser product volumes, was also a significant item and against that we had improvement in mix because our brand had improved from 18% to 22%. So pricing was the biggest item, and the utilization was the second biggest item we had some offsetting benefits from mix.", "And to the notebook question, the 2.5 inch product line, my reference related to the 400 gigabyte and 500 gigabyte capacity point and that ability to rapidly ramp reliably in that space and the customer acceptance of our ability to do that, overall, that have the effect, we think, we gained about two points of share in the notebook market.", "Scott Craig - Banc of America", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Kevin Rottinghaus with Cleveland Research, your line is open.", "Kevin Rottinghaus - Cleveland Research", "Thanks. The 13% decline this quarter that you are seeing for the industry. How much that you think is demand is versus inventory?", "John Coyne", "Still quite hard to separate that, taking on informed stab, probably two-thirds demand, one-third inventory sweeps.", "Kevin Rottinghaus - Cleveland Research", "Okay. And you've said kind of your inventory at least in the channel and at the retail level you think is okay. Is the inventory correction really just happening at the OEM level or do you think it's just other people in the industry that are kind of seeing an inventory correction happen?", "John Coyne", "I think it's throughout all channels and it's been driven by a number of things. As the demand ratchets down, the inventory that was appropriate last quarter is no longer appropriate, you need to bring the inventory down and concert with the demand reduction. So that's one item.", "The second item is credit availability where customers are looking to squeeze their inventory and turn those sales into cash and use the cash to pay down credit lines or to postpone that cash for the future in fear that they won't be able to renew credit lines and so on.", "So there is some impact of those behaviors,  also on people changing their business models to run with lighter inventory that, in terms of weeks of inventory, than they would have in the past.", "Kevin Rottinghaus - Cleveland Research", "Okay, for WDR, are you planning any manufacturing shutdowns this quarter?", "John Coyne", "We think we're sized to our own opportunity within the market, but we review this on a week-by-week basis as we map our demand profile against our production and our inventory levels and we manage all that on an ongoing basis, at this point, it's too early in the quarter to determine.", "Kevin Rottinghaus - Cleveland Research", "Okay, and then just one last question. On the 3.5 inch side, is the pricing stabilizing? Do you think that's any indication at all of distress from some of your competitors not being able to go there on price any more? What do you attribute the 3.5 inch kind of price stabilizing here in near-term too?", "John Coyne", "I think it's a reflection of a more mature market with a smaller supply base. And so the visibility into the demand is a little more predictable and the reaction to that, given that there is a smaller group of people trying to interpret that demand, signals tend to be better.", "And I think you see in that market, the predominance of that market supplied by three suppliers, the Seagate, ourselves, and Hitachi, so again, that kind of narrows an improved visibility.", "And then, there certainly are indications that there is significant stress in that market place from a price versus cost perspective. And so the behavior we are seeing is to be expected.", "Kevin Rottinghaus - Cleveland Research", "Thank you very much, appreciate that.", "Operator", "Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley, your line is open.", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks good, afternoon. What do you think your market share is now of notebooks? And as volumes have accelerated over the last couple of quarters, are the gross margin percentages of those lower capacity drive converging towards more mainframe capacities?", "John Coyne", "I think we have a representative share in that segment relative to our share in other segments. And it is a challenge right now from the margin perspective, because we have not yet developed a purpose design solution for that segment.", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "And does that relate to the planning around $1.5 billion of revenue? Is the model two quarters out to be back to a normalized margin off of $1.5 billion or to just be at least slightly profitable?", "John Coyne", "Couple of quarters down, we do not anticipate that economic conditions will have returned to normal. So we'll continue to operate, to model for, and to match the demand.", "And that again is the key factor. I mean, we need to size our business in order to be able to deal with the market conditions. And it's important that that's understood throughout the industry, because that really is the most critical component in the gross margin equation followed pretty closely by segment mix also.", "Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Got you. Thanks.", "Operator", "Joel Inman with Robert W. Baird, your line is open.", "Joel Inman - Robert W. Baird", "Hi. Thanks. Nice job on the quarter. So your OpEx guidance, did you say $175 million next quarter?", "Tim Leyden", "Yes, for OpEx.", "Joel Inman - Robert W. Baird", "And what's the reason that's going up?", "John Coyne", "14 weeks.", "Joel Inman - Robert W. Baird", "All right. Okay.", "John Coyne", "Q3, it's 175 million. And the reason that's going up relative to Q2, Tim, did call out that a component of the Q2 reduction quarter-to-quarter was a reversal of a bonus accrual from the September quarter.", "Tim Leyden", "Right. And so, we don't have that pickup in the March quarter. And that was, what, $16 million?", "John Coyne", "$16 million.", "Joel Inman - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. And then on the branded side of the business, how do you describe the competitive landscape there? I know you said it's intensifying. But as it pertains to third-party suppliers that don't actually manufacture the products, do you see some consolidation in that space in the near term?", "John Coyne", "Our observation is that things are becoming more competitive in that space. That will certainly put some pressure on people with marginal structures and marginal market access and so on. We believe we've got a great product line. We've got customer relationships, and we have a very good product roadmap.", "So we're very enthused about that market and we're very committed to continue to prosecute that market as the leaders. And we're working on that as we speak.", "Joel Inman - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. And then just the new product that you announced, is that available today?", "John Coyne", "Yes. That's been available since mid to end of September, and we're very pleased with the acceptance level on that product and we are very pleased with the excitement it's creating and the demand for incremental storage that that's creating, because it provides a very simple and elegant, straightforward mechanism to take drive content directly to the TV.", "Joel Inman - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "John Coyne", "Thank you.", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. John Coyne.", "John Coyne", "Thanks, Holly. In closing, I want to thank the entire WD team. I am greatly appreciative of the loyalty and commitment to WD's success displayed by all of our employees as we resize our business, those who are, unfortunately, leaving us and those who are staying with reduced compensation packages. Their integrity and class, their sustained focus, commitment to success and outstanding execution in these trying times is truly inspiring.", "Our results in such challenging market conditions are a testament to their capability and tenacity. Despite the current state of the economy, we remain very encouraged by the long-term market opportunities for high-capacity storage in the years ahead. The applications driving the digitization of massive content are not going away. We are taking what we believe are prudent and appropriate steps to size our business for the new economic environment we expect throughout calendar 2009.", "We remain committed to provide the best customer value proposition in the industry to deliver financial results which allow us to make the substantial investments required to continue to lead the industry and providing solutions to customer needs for high capacity, cost effective storage and to generate superior returns for our supply partners, our employees, the communities in which we operate and our shareholders.", "I'd like to thank you again for joining us today, and I look forward to keeping you informed of our progress.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jay Iyer, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon everyone. Joining us on the call today are Dr. Eli Harari, Chairman and CEO of SanDisk; Sanjay Mehrotra, President and COO; and Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President of Administration and CFO.", "Before we begin, please note that any non-GAAP financial measures discussed during this call as defined by the SEC in Regulation G will be reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. That reconciliation is now available along with supplemental schedules on our website at sandisk.com/IR.", "In addition, during our call today we will make forward-looking statements. Any statement that refers to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events, including financial projections and future market conditions is a forward-looking statement. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the Risk Factors discussed in the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K/A for fiscal 2008 and our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.", "SanDisk assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, which speak as of their respective dates.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to Eli.", "Eli Harari", "", "Thank you, Jay. Our first quarter results represent a substantial improvement over the prior quarter. Demand for our products in the first quarter was stronger than expected and is holding up in April. NAND component pricing trends, which began a U-turn late in the fourth quarter of 2008, have continued to improve in the first quarter and into April.", "Our production cut backs implemented in the first quarter and continuing in the current quarter combined with the successful completion of the restructuring of our manufacturing joint venture with Toshiba in the first quarter are positively impacting our inventory levels and provide us improved flexibility in managing our business back to profitability.", "", "Our product gross margin in Q1 were substantially better than in Q4 and although we are still in negative territory, we believe gross margin is heading in the right direction in Q2. Our focus is on returning to profitability and to that end, we have raised prices for Q2 and of course our product cost should continue to decline throughout 2009, in particular due to aggressive ramping of our 3 bits per cell x3 NAND.", "A key factor for improved industry fundamentals in Q1 was that substantial Q4 '08 losses reported by all NAND suppliers including ourselves brought about industry-wide NAND production cut backs in the first quarter. With supply coming into better balance with demand, NAND component pricing stabilized and began to rise, a phenomenon the NAND component market has not experienced in recent memory.", "Although, this downturn is by no means over, things do look in field better now than at the beginning of the year. Third-party market research firms are forecasting that even if capacity utilization in the industry increases to 100% in the second half of 2009, industry-wide NAND bit output will grow by 50% to 60% in 2009 compared to 130% and higher in each of the previous five years. Sharp reductions in 2009 capital investments announced by the major NAND suppliers including ourselves reflect on healthy state of the NAND business during the last several quarters as cumulative price reductions, [positive] cost reductions in each of the past three years.", "Additionally, the current scarcity of financing options due to the global credit crunch coupled with currently negative return on investment is likely to put a damper on the launch of new NAND wafer fabs until business conditions improve substantially. In the second half of this year, we expect demand for NAND to continue to grow particularly for mobile and portable computing platforms and this should hopefully absorb the industry supply growth projected for second half.", "For our own restructured captive supply, we expect to return to full utilization rates in fab 3 and 4 in the second half. However, our decision on second half utilization rate will depend on actual market conditions this summer and we have some flexibility to dial it down if necessary.", "We expect to start our 32-nanometer wafer production with 2-bits and 3-bits per cell NAND this summer and we believe that our memory cost structure should remain highly competitive in 2009 and 2010. As for demand creation, I believe that the handset business is being transformed on a scale similar to that which the web experienced in its early days and this has far-reaching implications for our mobile storage business.", "In the U.S., you need to only pickup any major newspaper or turn on the TV to see compelling ads by Apple touting thousands of third-party applications for the iPhone. These evidenced the handsets transformation into a powerful mobile computer. And it is into only Apple, rooms newly launched up store, the rapid adoption of the Android platform that prompts three Nokia and Microsoft roadmaps all these show what handsets can become and in large measure have already become. These smart phones along with other mobile Internet devices so-called MIDs and netbook PCs are increasingly ubiquitous always connected and often subsidized by your local network operator. The opportunity for us is that these devices will have to be contented with wireless bandwidth and coverage limitations making off-line, local cashing of increased amount of data central to devices usability. Paradoxically, the promise of always-connected devices in cloud computing is resulting in ever greater need for local storage on the devices themselves.", "Indeed, we are seeing increasing demand from major players in the mobile ecosystem for our comprehensive mobile storage solutions including Mobile Card, embedded iNAND and solid state drives for netbook PC's.", "And speaking of SSD, we are shipping our second generation modular SSD known as SanDisk PSSD to netbook OEM's, and we continue to make good progress with our G3 SSD platform in our own costs for OEM customer sampling this summer. Regarding, our license renewal negotiation with Samsung, these are continuing and there is no further update for this time.", "To summarize, I believe that we are executing well in the current environment, which remains challenging, although improving. Our decisive actions during the past two quarters have given us strong competitiveness and market focus, greater financial control and flexibility in our business. We believe that the mobile and computing storage markets are truly exciting and offer tremendous opportunities for our growth in the years ahead.", "I will turn it over to Judy now.", "Judy Bruner", "Thank you, Eli. Our first quarter revenue was higher than we had forecasted, driven by stronger than expected demand primarily in our OEM channels, but also in retail. First quarter gigabyte sold, grew 9% sequentially with unit sales down 7% from the holiday fourth quarter and average capacity up 18%. On a year-over-year basis, our unit sales continued to grow increasing 11% and with average capacity up 140%, our gigabyte sold grew 166%.", "Our first quarter ASP per gigabyte came down 27%, reflecting price declines that were put in place early in Q1 in both OEM and retail channels, as well as our focus on monetizing our inventory. With an improved supply demand balance, we began raising prices in the first quarter and we expect the positive impact to be primarily felt in the second quarter.", "Our retail business made up 59% of first quarter product revenue. The sequential decline in retail unit sales from Q4 to Q1 was 30%, very similar to the last two years and contrary to our expectation that the seasonal unit decline would be more pronounced because of deteriorating economic conditions.", "On a year-over-year basis, retail unit sales continued to grow and were up 14% with growth driven primarily by USB drives. Our OEM unit sales grew 18% sequentially and 9% year-over-year. Most of this growth came from microSD cards sold in the mobile market, in particular to mobile network operators.", "License and royalty revenue for the first quarter was $71 million, down $50 million from the previous quarter with the decline due primarily to lower flash memory revenue reported by our licensees in the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, our first quarter royalty revenue was negatively impacted by a reconciliation item from a licensee relating to new computations from them for years prior to 2008, which we are currently reviewing.", "Non-GAAP product gross loss for Q1 improved considerably from the prior quarter, but it was still negative 67 million or minus 11% of product revenue. Cost of sales for Q1 included a charge for Q2 planned under-utilization of capacity of $63 million and benefited from a net reduction in inventory reserves of $34 million. Our improved pricing outlook resulted in new inventory reserves being less than the reserves released for product sold during Q1.", "Non-GAAP operating expenses of a $150 million were less than we had forecasted reflecting successful restructuring and cost containment actions, as well as the postponement of certain expenses. Sales and marketing is the area where we took the strongest cost reduction actions. And in addition, Q1 included minimal investments in merchandising and branding.", "Non-GAAP other income expense was an expense of $6 million in the range we forecasted, including costs related to the joint venture restructuring, as well as a final impairment for the disposition of FlashVision\u2019s 200-millimeter equipment. Our GAAP other income expense was an expense of $19 million and includes a $13 million non-cash interest charge related to the new accounting requirements for cash settled convertible debt.", "Our non-GAAP tax provision for Q1 is a tax benefit of 28%. On a GAAP basis, we are not benefitting our U.S. tax losses. So our GAAP tax provision primarily reflects taxes owed in profitable foreign jurisdictions. On the balance sheet, cash and short and long-term liquid investments decreased sequentially by a $154 million to $2.38 billion. Cash flow from operations was a negative $114 million including receipt of a tax refund of a $179 million received one quarter earlier than expected. We still expect to receive approximately another $60 million tax refund later in the year. The usage of cash by operating activities, which was $293 million before the tax refund was influenced by a pay down of accounts payable by $183 million as we reduced expenses, CapEx and wafer starts.", "Cash flow used in CapEx related investing was a net of minus $52 million. Our investments in Flash Partners and Flash Alliance are very front-end loaded this year. And we invested $326 million in the joint ventures in Q1 leaving us with no more than a 100 million to be invested during the remainder of 2009.", "We received $277 million from the joint venture restructuring and $13 million related to the closure of the 200-millimeter FlashVision joint venture. Non-fab related CapEx investments were $16 million. Our inventory balance declined by $46 million driven primarily by strong memory cost reduction. We are pleased that net inventory dollars came down even after a reduction in inventory reserves. A significant accomplishment in Q1 was the reduction of our off-balance sheet equipment lease obligations, which now stand at $1.2 billion, down from $2.1 billion at the end of Q4.", "This reduction in off-balance sheet obligations reflects the transfer of leases to Toshiba, regular lease payments made by us, and the depreciation of the yen to the dollar. The dollar amount of long-term convertible debt on our balance sheet was reduced due to the restatement required for the new accounting pronouncement for cash settled convertibles. This new accounting required adjusting our income statement and balance sheet results from the initial issuance of the convertible debt in May 2006, through 2008. In addition, we have moved $75 million of convertible debt to current liabilities. This debt was assumed in the acquisition of Msystems and the debtholders have a call right in March 2010.", "I will now turn to forward-looking commentary. Please note that non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation tables are posted on our website for all applicable guidance. We are forecasting stable to slightly higher pricing for Q2 relative to Q1. Higher pricing may reduce the typical growth we have seen in the second quarter in unit demand and average capacity. However, the restructuring of our captive supply allows us to more effectively balance profitability and volume. We are forecasting total revenue for Q2 between $650 and $725 million including license and royalty revenue between $85 million and $95 million.", "Our Q2 non-GAAP product gross margin should continue to improve based on stable to slightly higher pricing and reduced product costs. Although this will be partially offset by more expensive yen based wafer purchases primarily from late Q4 and early Q1 that will be reflected in Q2 cost of sales. The Q2 product gross margin will also be influenced by the second half pricing outlook when we get to the end of Q2. If the second half pricing outlook at that time is for a continued benign pricing, then there should be little need for new inventory reserves and existing lower of cost or market inventory reserves will be released as the inventory is sold. In such a scenario, we would expect slightly positive product gross margin in the second quarter.", "We forecast Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses between $170 and $180 million, including the delay of certain expenditures from Q1 to Q2, as well as higher retail mechanizing costs for Q2. For the full year, we are now expecting operating expenses to be between $700 and $725 million, down from our previous $750 million guidance.", "We expect other income and expense for Q2 to be income between $5 and $15 million. Our total capital investment forecast remains at $500 million for 2009. Following the $326 million loan to the joint ventures in Q1, we expect approximately $75 million in Q2 and $25 million in the second half. Our non-fab CapEx is expected to be approximately $75 million for the year.", "We expect a modest decline in our overall cash balance in Q2. Q2 will not benefit from the large cash inflows that we received in Q1 namely the JV restructuring and the tax refund. However, we expect the underlying cash usage from operations and capital investing to be less in Q2 than in Q1.", "Maintaining balance sheet strength, while also improving the bottom line, remain key priorities.", "We'll now open the call for your questions.", "Eli Harari", "Glenn, we are ready for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We will go first to Daniel Berenbaum with Auriga USA.", "Daniel Berenbaum \u2013 Auriga USA", "", "Yes, thanks for taking my call. Judy, when you are talking about pricing, obviously pricing has been firming. When you talk about pricing going up in Q2, are you talking, just to clarify, you\u2019re talking essentially about product pricing and what\u2019s happening to pricing on a per megabit basis?", "Judy Bruner", "I'm talking about SanDisk\u2019s product, average ASP per gigabyte for our products that. We are expecting that average ASP per gigabyte to be stable to slightly up in Q2.", "Daniel Berenbaum \u2013 Auriga USA", "", "Okay. And, just out of curious, so that hasn't happened for quite a while back in my model.", "Judy Bruner", "It\u2019s right.", "Daniel Berenbaum \u2013 Auriga USA", "What you call in the last and that happened on a per megabyte basis per gigabyte basis?", "Judy Bruner", "I don\u2019t believe that it's happened while I have been here for five years.", "Daniel Berenbaum \u2013 Auriga USA", "", "Okay.", "Eli Harari", "", "I have been here 21, years I'm trying to remember.", "Daniel Berenbaum \u2013 Auriga USA", "", "So you would then characterize this as the best pricing you\u2019ve seen in awhile. And then along those lines, can you talk about.", "Eli Harari", "But let\u2019s say, the pricing is still not very good, quite honestly. I mean the pricing is, I mean we are still reporting negative margins.", "Judy Bruner", "We would like to see several quarters of benign pricing to get our P&L healthy again.", "Daniel Berenbaum \u2013 Auriga USA", "Right. So then along those lines, seems like cost reduction in the quarter was quite good again, by my calculations was the best you have seen in at least a couple of years. Can you give us guidance for a full year cost reduction, and then also since megabit shipments were up in Q1, which again I have to go back to \u201906 to see an up Q1 megabit shipments I think, where do you think that your megabit shipments are going to be for the full year?", "Judy Bruner", "You are right, that our cost reduction in Q1 was very good. And it was largely the result of seeing the benefit of transition to 43-nanometer in 2008, which then begins to roll through our cost of sales in 2009. We still expect our overall cost reduction on a cost per bit basis to be in the range of 40% to 50% for 2009, that\u2019s a range that we gave on our last conference call. And you are also right, that the 9% increase in bit sales in Q1 is very good, compared to...", "Eli Harari", "Particularly given outlook at the beginning of the year with the economic meltdown, this was quite surprising to us, really it is actually quite stunning.", "Judy Bruner", "But I would tell you, we are not prepared to give a full year bit gross guidance in terms of revenue. I will say that in 2008, our bit growth in sales was a 125%, in Q1 \u201809 it was a 166% on a year-over-year basis. And clearly we expect our bit growth in sales this year 2009 to be quite a bit ahead of our supply growth in bits. And that\u2019s what's helping our business get healthier again.", "Daniel Berenbaum \u2013 Auriga USA", "And then you would expect, what was your bit growth in terms of supply. Could you give a projection for that.", "Judy Bruner", "It will be less than 50% this year.", "Daniel Berenbaum \u2013 Auriga USA", "Still less than 50%. Okay, thanks very much.", "Eli Harari", "", "That new supply, but we started the year with a high inventory.", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. We have inventory, we had started the year with high inventory. We still have more inventory than we would like and that\u2019s what is enabling us to achieve much higher bit growth in revenue than the supply growth.", "Daniel Berenbaum \u2013 Auriga USA", "Okay great. Thanks very much.", "Jay Iyer", "Next question please.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Gary Hsueh with Oppenheimer.", "Gary Hsueh \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Great. Thank you. With better visibility and as you said indications of a more benign pricing environment, I mean does it still make sense here to considered equity offering that\u2019s still prudent to raise cash at the expense of 12% to 20% shareholder dilution with better expectation for cash flow and pricing and profitability here in Q2 in the second half?", "Judy Bruner", "We\u2019ve not made any definitive plans in terms of a capital raise. As you know, we have our shelf in place and we can move quickly, if we believe there is an appropriate opportunity. But at this point, we\u2019ve not made any definitive plans. We are watching the markets and we\u2019re watching our own results very carefully.", "Gary Hsueh \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "", "Okay.", "Eli Harari", "And we are very sensitized to the dilution issue.", "Gary Hsueh \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Okay. But it\u2019s not fair to characterize the situation by saying the probability of this happening now is  a little bit less given better results and more benign pricing ", "Judy Bruner", "There is a lot of factors that will weigh into any decision that we should make and again, we are watching everything very carefully.", "Gary Hsueh \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Okay, understood. Second question here on products. Could you help me understand how the company is stepping through the product cycle, here and going from MLC to the x3 and eventually the x4 architecture? Could you talk about commercialization, can you update us on prospects for commercialization for the x3 in the second half. And is that expected to occur more on the OEM side or more on the retail side. And if you could explain like-for-like coming from MLC, what the impact could be on gross margin. I understand at least on the management side, x3, x4 requires a lot heavier hand in terms of management like ECC and block management. So, I am just wondering if increasing management in DSP needs is going to start to impact on the negative side gross margin on some of those products.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "With respect to x3, we are actually very pleased with the progress that we are making on the ramp of x3 in production. If you recall, last quarter I reported that in Q4 we had about 15% of our bit production in x3 and that has continued to increase in the first quarter.  About 25% of our bit production is in x3 in first quarter and our goal is to have about 50% of total bits produced in 3-bits and 4-bits in 2009 and we are on track for that. With respect to four-wafer cell, we have said that we will be introducing this in mid this year. We are on schedule for that. The production output of 4-bit per cell will likely be relatively small compared to 3-bit per cell. And as we get into 32-nanometer technology, it is likely that compared to 2 bit and 3 bit per cell it will become even smaller. The cost benefits of 3 bit per cell by product level is in the range of 15% to 20% over 2 bit per cell and for 4 bit per cell obviously, compared to 3 bit per cell, it will be a smaller percentage. Hence, overall basically for x3 doing well and we plan to apply it to all of our products, actually we have already been shipping it in our retail products, as well as our OEM products. x4 will be shipping in certain limited applications because x4 is a more challenging technology, and the suitability for applications tend to be more in somewhat lower performance products such as our blue label cards, and that\u2019s where we plan to introduce that first.", "Gary Hsueh \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Okay. So let me get this straight. So, the transaction from MLC to x3 is pretty much transparent with the added benefit of 15% to 20% cost savings, but the transition from x3 to x4 is a little bit more niche oriented?", "Sanjay Mehrotra ", "Yes, but in the products that we apply it x3 and x4, we make sure that those technologies are transparent to the user. So x4, the product that you will plan to apply to it. It will be transparent to the user in those products. And you would also add regarding controllers, certainly you\u2019ll demand 3 bit per cell and 4 bit per cell technologies into products requiring significant level of controller sophistication. And 4 bit et cetera and SanDisk has expertise over last 20 years developing  that. We have best position in terms of commercializing these technologies. And from a controller point of view, the cost is really not any significant in terms of 3 bit per cell or 4 bit per cell products.", "Gary Hsueh \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Okay, perfect.", "Eli Harari", "I just wanted to add one thing and that is that, as far as the cost reduction number that Judy gave you, the 40 to 50% for 2009. If you add that to what Sanjay just said, you could see that x3 is a very important component of our cost reduction effort for 2009 and for that reason, we believe very strongly that x3 technology is pretty fundamental, pretty crucial for the entire NAND flash industry to be able to continue aggressive cost reductions.", "Gary Hsueh \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Great. Great, thanks Eli.", "Jay Iyer", "Next question please?", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.", "Jim Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thanks, good evening. I appreciate the chance to ask a couple of questions. First, I guess on the comment, Judy about the recalculation from one of the licensees. Could you give us a little more detail about that and when that might get resolved?", "Judy Bruner", "I would tell you that our license agreements are fairly complex, they require some complex calculations and in this case, the licensee believes that they incorrectly computed, license payments for several years prior to 2008. We have not recognized revenue for this amount and it\u2019s been reviewed, but I can\u2019t give you anything really beyond that.", "Jim Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Is the number that you\u2019ve recognized in Q1 reflective of some sort of catch-up or that\u2019s what the lower rate would reflect?", "Judy Bruner ", "", "What we recognized in Q1 is net of the total amount of the reconciliation item.", "Jim Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, okay. If I can ask then maybe about the Japanese rating agency, what kind of dialog do you have with them? How much of an issue is this? With the business prospects looking much better, do you feel a lot more comfortable that there isn\u2019t a ratings downgrade issue there or did you never feel that that was much of a threat or did they have more of a backward looking view as opposed to a forward-looking view?", "Judy Bruner", "We have a pretty regular dialog with the rating agency in Japan. We meet with them either in person or by phone typically quarterly and they look carefully at our results every quarter. I am sure they look carefully at the results we just announced today. I would tell you generally I believe our results are better than what third parties were expecting, but I can't speak for the rating agency.", "Jim Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, great. If I could just ask one or two more, relative to the very low CapEx level in the back half of this year. I understand the comments about further cost reductions in the second half of 2009, that's really a reflection of what you\u2019ve spent up until now, but will you be able to reduce cost significantly in 2010, if with the very low level of CapEx in the second half of 2009 or said another way when do you run out of the ability to reduce cost without starting to crank up the CapEx engine again?", "Judy Bruner", "Well. Let me just comment on one thing there, and then I will turn it over to Sanjay. Recognize that the cash that we spend on CapEx is actually lagged from when the investments are made. This is the way the joint ventures operate and so we will be investing in equipment. And the fact, in 2009 for the transition to 32-nanometer and much of that will end up getting paid for in 2010, just as what we just paid for in Q1 was largely for equipment that was installed in 2008.", "", "Jim Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay. So the lower CapEx isn't necessarily reflective of what you are ordering or what the technology transitions would be?", "Judy Bruner", "It is the 500 million a year, is an approximate run rate when we are not adding new wafer capacity. It\u2019s just that the payment for the different technology transitions lags when the investment is really made.", "Jim Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay.", "", "Sanjay Mehrotra ", "On the cost reduction, I\u2019ll just add that for 2010 the main driver of cost reduction would be of course continuing to use the 3-bit-per-cell technology in production, but also transitioning to 32-nanometer technology. Just like in 2009, we are getting the full benefit of transitioning to 43-nanometer, as well as x3 2010. And the cost benefit will come from 32-nanometer transition which will begin mid next year in terms of wafer starts.", "", "Jim Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay.", "", "Eli Harari", " ", "But Jim, let me also add to what Judy was saying. And I said that in the last quarterly earnings conference call, the 32-nanometer equipment set is not much more than the 43-nanometer equipment set, because they are so close together. The equipment set that we have in place for 43-nanometer can cover most of the process steps for 32-nanometer. And therefore the additional CapEx required is not like starting a clean wafer start, it\u2019s actually just an enhancement. It\u2019s a very cost effective, CapEx utilization going from 43-nanometer to 32-nanometer.", "", "Jim Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "And that\u2019s very helpful. Final question, then I will go away. In terms of restarting the fabs, I heard what you said, but it was, what would be the barrier to restarting the fabs in Q2, why, given that things are little bit better now, why wouldn\u2019t you restart the fabs in Q2, given the delay between when you\u2019re going to restart the fabs and when you\u2019re actually going to get some product out? Thank you so much.", "Sanjay Mehrotra ", "So, we indicated that our utilization rate in second quarter is somewhat higher than Q1. And we've also indicated that the second half of the year, we plan to be at 100% utilization of course. The wafer starts for the timeframe are not locked in yet, we can always adjust their timing back down. Also as Judy indicated that meeting our increases in demand projection through of course increases in our new supply, but also continuing to utilize our inventory to sell the products. So with all of that, we feel that the utilization rate in Q2, is at the right level for our business.", "Eli Harari", " ", "I think also it\u2019s important not to honestly jump too far ahead of ourselves, one quarter is just one quarter. And we really need to see a trend developing over the next several quarters. So, I think caution is important, conservatism is I think well placed.", "Jim Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thank you so much.", "Jay Iyer", "Next question please.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.", "Edwin Mok \u2013 Needham & Company", "Hi, thanks for taking my question and good quarter. Just first question is regarding yourguidance. If I use the midpoint of guidance it seems to imply not noted growth in second quarter. Is it because you guys expect lower bit growth because of higher prices or can you share some light on that? Are you just being conservative?", "Judy Bruner", "Sure Edwin, as I said in my prepared remarks, we don\u2019t have much experience with this pricing environment, in terms of prices going up. And we do believe that could dampen somewhat the bit growth that we have seen typically, historically in second quarters. So that was taken into account.", "Edwin Mok \u2013 Needham & Company", "I see, great. And then my second question is regarding non-captive. Do you guys have any non-captive supply in the first quarter planned for second quarter or do you expect to have any this year?", "Sanjay Mehrotra ", "We do not have any non-captive supply in the first quarter or second quarter. And at this point, we are not planning non-captive supply for second half. Although, there are demand scenarios that can be envisioned where a non-captive supply may be needed toward late in the year.", "", "Edwin Mok \u2013 Needham & Company", "Great. Thank you all. My third question is regarding, maybe your customer inventory. So, first quarter was quite strong, and you guys had positive bit growth in the first quarter. I guess a two-part question. First question, first part is, is it possible that because you have [covered] with a lower price in the first quarter, and you guys are raising price, your customer may be building inventory ahead of that. And then, the second part of the question is, have you seen increase bit per cart for your OEM customer, did that drive up demand for the OEM side. Thank you.", "Judy Bruner", "I would tell you that I don't think there is anything unusual in terms of the inventory held by our customers. Retail channel inventory is at a very normal level, it was about seven weeks at the end of our first quarter.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Regarding average capacities, which I believe you were asking for the OEM side. We definitely saw in the first quarter a nice increase in average capacities both in our OEM business, as well as retail business. And the OEM business, the average capacity on a per product basis increased well above 100% on a year-over-year basis.", "Edwin Mok \u2013 Needham & Company", "So is it fair to say that OEM costs out, because historical OEM cost tends to be a bit smaller than the retailer costs, and is it fair to say that is catching up right now, is that the trend that you\u2019re looking?", "", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "", "So, our average capacity in retial are certainly higher than OEM, but yes I mean on the OEM side the rate of increase has been substantial, but the retail side the average capacities have continued to increase as well. Retial average capacities have also increased more than 100% on a year-over-year basis.", "Edwin Mok \u2013 Needham & Company", "Great. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you.", "Jay Iyer", "", "All right. Next question please.", "Operator", "", "We\u2019ll go next to Daniel Amir with Lazard.", "Daniel Amir \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets", "", "Thanks a lot and congratulations on a good quarter.", "Eli Harari", "Thank you.", "Daniel Amir \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets", "", "Couple of questions here, Eli maybe this is for you. We\u2019ve seen in the past, these occasional price increases, obviously, it\u2019s been the magnitude here it\u2019s been probably a little sharper than previous times. What kind of gives you the confidence that this is different this time and that the memory market has kind of really learned this lesson. And we\u2019re starting to see more of a longer period now maybe potential price stabilization compared to the ups and downs that we\u2019ve seen maybe in \u201906, \u201907 and \u201908?", "Eli Harari", "", "Good question Daniel, and thank you. I can\u2019t speak for our \u2013 excuse me, of course I could say that we\u2019ve learned a lesson off our over investment, over exuberance in 2006 and 2007, to a certain extent, off of 2008 and the restructuring that we have accomplished here is very, very good for us to basically, we balanced ourselves and resized ourselves. But I would say that the basic fundamentals that are very encouraging is that the industry as a whole has understood that, these thing is continues price reductions exceeding cost reductions eventually it makes the whole business such that there is no return on investment, which can justify new capacity increases.", "The one big change that we\u2019re seeing this year is the pretty dramatic reduction in CapEx almost across the Board taking us from I think what Judy said, 130% capacity increases last year and more or like 170% per year increase, in everyone over the prior years going onto 50% to 60% this year. That is immense; I mean remember when Samsung had a fire for like two days, about three years ago and that was a big blip on the pricing side, those costs have subsided. We are not taking about here two day production cuts. We are talking about six months production cuts with very, very substantial production in total capacity growth coming to the industry. In the meantime of course demand continues to grow. We do have markets, this is not the DRAM industry, there is nothing very dynamic about DRAM and there is plenty dynamic about NAND.", "I mean NAND is a young industry and tremendous growth that I try to capture with the mobile, with the third-party applications and with solid state disk. So, now I do believe that this 60% or so annual price declines are really not sustainable, I've said that over the last three years and [inaudible] is definitely slowing down if you do the calculation for 32-nanometer compared to 42, 43 nanometer you see that it cannot support 60% cost reductions and therefore I think that the fundamentals dictate that if people want to run a profitable business, then this needs to be managed to justify a return of investment and today's return of investment is still negative based on today's pricing. So I think it\u2019s very encouraging and I believe that really if somebody decided today, if the biggest supplier in this market decided today that they are going to pull all the stuff and really drive up, it\u2019s still not going to make much of a difference in 2009. and I think it is really talking about, I think a period of return to much better health. But again demand is the key and without demand, demand is one part of the equation that we really don\u2019t have any idea where it's going to go.", "Daniel Amir \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets", "", "Okay. Maybe I\u2019ll follow through with that question. Related to the kind of demand and the pricing, how do we look at the SSD market, I mean obviously now pricing has gone up. So that some times it is countered to big argument of SSD versus hard disk drives. But what are you seeing on the cost front and on the MLC SSD now, when we should start seeing SSD becoming a bigger or an important portion of the NAND market?", "Eli Harari", "", "SSD eventually, of course, we always believed will be a very substantial part of the NAND market, NAND consumption market, but again it\u2019s a question of, it\u2019s going to be profitable in order to justify investments in major production capacity to meet the future demand. What is pretty obvious now is that the SSD market is going to be highly segmented. It\u2019s going to have the enterprise space and which by itself a bit segmented, the mid range in notebook and desktop PCs and then netbook and niche. And I think each one of these markets are going to have strong dynamics including gross margins and target pricing that\u2019s required to get those markets to really takeoff. I think the enterprise space we are already meeting the price requirements even with SLC NAND. We are not there yet with netbooks and notebook PCs. And we need to be careful that we don\u2019t get too far ahead of ourselves in terms of this euphoria about such a huge market because it really needs to be thought of from the point of view of both meeting the requirements of the market price wide, but also the requirements for achieving profitability. And we are going to for ourselves, we are definitely going to prioritize profitability.", "Daniel Amir \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Jay Iyer", "", "Next question please.", "Operator", "We\u2018ll go next to Vijay Rakesh with Thinkequity.", "Vijay Rakesh \u2013 Thinkequity Llc", "Thank you, guys. Just a couple of questions here, I was wondering, you said inventories are coming down in the second quarter, I was wondering what\u2018s a good number there, and also wondering what your depreciation for the year looks like for \u201809?", "Judy Bruner", "", "Vijay I don\u2019t believe I gave any guidance on inventory for the second quarter. Really it\u2019s hard to predict at this point, whether inventory dollars will go down or go up in the second quarter, a lot depends on demand, as well as on the level of inventory reserves released or taken during the second quarter. So, we don\u2019t have a specific forecast on inventory dollars for the second quarter.", "Vijay Rakesh \u2013 Thinkequity Llc", "Okay.", "Judy Bruner", "And I am sorry.

It was $39 million. So, I think that\u2019s a reasonable run rate on a quarterly basis. We have split out this time. We split out depreciation and amortization. So, those are on two different lines.", "Vijay Rakesh \u2013 Thinkequity Llc", "Got it. My other question was, actually you ramped 32-nanometer here, what percentage do you think that will be your output and let\u2019s say Q2 and going forward into Q3?", "Sanjay Mehrotra ", "So, we have said that 32-nanometer will actually begin, ramp mid this year. We are in the stages of qualifying the technology in our product. So, it\u2019s not part of any Q2 bit production. and in Q3 it will be a relatively small portion and towards Q4 and toward the end of the year, is when it\u2019ll start ramping up to a meaningful volume.", "Vijay Rakesh \u2013 Thinkequity Llc", "Got it.

The operating expense reduction was pretty amazing actually. I think it is a brilliant job. What though are the trade-offs, what is it the firm has had to sacrifice in cutting back so swiftly?", "Eli Harari", " ", "I think that -- we fundamentally maintain all of our strategic initiatives intact. We are doing fewer things with less resources using them -- those resources perhaps more focused. We went from individual business unit structure to an OEM organization, and a retail organization in central operations and central engineering, which used to be our organization before the acquisition of Msystems. And that really does eliminate a lot of duplicative functions. It\u2019s basically the trade of between being most effective and most efficient. And we are I believe, we are more efficient now. And we simplified our market focus. We have certainly not slowed down in any of our technology, our 3D Read/Write, our 32 and 24-nanometer NAND, 3 and 4 bits for cell and on innovation, product innovation applications of the technology to decommoditize more and more of our future business.", "Paul Coster \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay. Judy, you mentioned that there were some inventory reserves. I think they were released in this first quarter. Can you just go back across them and sort of clarify, what if any impacts you have in gross margins?", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. I said that there was a net release of inventory reserves of $34 million. So, there was a benefit to cost of sales and to gross margins of $34 million. At the same time, I also said there was a charge to cost of sales in the first quarter of $63 million, which is our estimated cost of the fab under utilization in the second quarter. So, those were the two large unusual items in gross margins in the first quarter.", "", "Paul Coster \u2013 JP Morgan", "", "Okay, got it.

I would guess the $34 million benefit, you could see a similar type of benefit in your Q2 gross margin, correct?", "Judy Bruner", "", "That could be the case.

Thanks.", "Judy Bruner", "Okay.", "Jay Iyer", "Next question please.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Hendi Susanto with Gabelli & Company.", "Hendi Susanto \u2013 Gabelli & Company", "Thank you for taking my questions. Could you give us more color on the transition process that is going into a mix production of captive versus non-captive? For example, what will be the ideal mix, what kind of timeline can we expect and in theory how long may that take, and lastly what kind of gross margin difference can one expect?", "Sanjay Mehrotra ", "So, like you\u2019ve said in the past, that our ultimate goal is to get to a captive, non-captive mix of 70% captive to 80% captive. And in terms of the timeframe to meet this kind of decisions, we are always evaluating based on our demand projections and our own captive available supply. Typically, it means a lead time of about three to four months to make decisions related to non captive purchases and the gross margin impact of non captive purchase on captive is really very much function of the non captive supply pricing. Obviously, the cost structure of a captive would be much lower than the cost of the non-captive that you will purchase. Again for 2009, we are not really projecting much use of non-captive.", "Hendi Susanto \u2013 Gabelli & Company", "Okay and second question. Could you give us a range of how much Japanese yen currency impact can be in the second quarter?", "Judy Bruner", "As I said, the cost of the wafers that I expect will be recognized through cost of sales in the second quarter will be more expensive than the cost that was recognized in the first quarter, and that's because the yen rates were less attractive for us late in Q4 and early in Q1, and that's my estimate of the timing in terms of the wafers when they were purchased and then ultimately flowing through cost of sales in the second quarter. And it could have several points of impact on gross margins.", "Hendi Susanto \u2013 Gabelli & Company", "Thank you.", "Jay Iyer", "", "Next question please.", "Operator", "We will go next to Uche Orji with UBS.", "Stephen Chin \u2013 UBS", "", "Hi, thank you. This is Stephen Chin calling on behalf of Uche. Just a follow-up to the prior question, regarding the balance between non-captive and captive supply, so assuming you guys are able to ramp production back to full capacity by Q3 and Q4. And I would assume there is some type of mix of non-captive purchases. However, in terms of any further upside to demand in that case. What would be the plan for building a capacity in the second phase of fab four, first of all? And I guess, secondly what would be the capital that\u2019s available as a means for financing that type of expansion at this point?", "Judy Bruner", "I would tell you. At this point, we are not thinking about plans for adding wafer capacity. We really want to get our model back to a mixed model of captive and non-captive and in the range of 20% to 30% non-captive, before we really begin to think about too much about new wafer capacity. So, I would tell you that's really a question for another day as opposed to today.", "Stephen Chin \u2013 UBS", "Okay. The other question I have was on the flow-through cost of starting up the 32-nanometer production line. I would assume if that you ramp production by Q2 timeframe, is there going to be a typical impact on R&D first of all and then flowing on to COGS by Q4?", "Judy Bruner", "I don\u2019t expect any significant impact on R&D and I would tell you in terms of cost benefit, given the lag in our business model, the second half of 2009 will be I believe more impacted by the increasing mix of x3 versus x2 and the transition to 32 nanometer, would probably start to see some impact very late in the year and then falling into 2010.", "Stephen Chin \u2013 UBS", "Okay. And lastly just on the potential price increases that was referred to earlier. Is there a limit on how much you can raise pricing both in the OEM and retail channel under your contracts?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So remember we are always trying to balance our profitability objectives as our total volume inventory et cetera. So this is a careful balance and we are reevaluating it on a regular basis and making adjustments as appropriate.", "Stephen Chin \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Thank you.", "Eli Harari", " ", "Yes, that is from the model versus the Wal-Mart. I mean basically with higher pricings, you lose market share but you have more profitability and what you do so, but any way, I think we've been balancing this over the last 20 years and we are very, very focused on getting to profitability. I think we have to wrap it up, really I appreciate you joining us today and look forward to talking to you again during the quarter and next quarter.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jay Iyer, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. ", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you and good afternoon everyone.  Joining us on the call today are Dr. Eli Harari, Chairman and CEO of SanDisk, and Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President of Administration and CFO.  Sanjay Mehrotra, our President and COO, is away attending an off-site executive training program. ", " ", "Before we begin, please note that any non-GAAP financial measures discussed during this call, as defined by the SEC in Regulation G, will be reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.  That reconciliation is now available along with supplemental schedules on our web site at sandisk.com/IR. ", "In addition, during our call today we will make forward-looking statements.  Any statement that refers to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events, including financial projections and future market conditions, is a forward-looking statement. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.  For more information, please refer to the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d discussed in the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for fiscal 2008 and our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.  SanDisk assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, which speak as of the date hereof.   ", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to Eli. ", " ", "Eli Harari ", "Thank you, Jay. SanDisk delivered a profitable quarter in the second quarter for the first time in about five quarters.  Resizing our organization in the fourth quarter of 2008 and restructuring our manufacturing joint ventures with Toshiba in the first quarter of 2009, coupled with strong execution in operations and technology are providing us new flexibility to achieve our financial objectives.  ", "In the first half we have been able to weather the slow economy by leveraging our diversified channels and global brand, with approximately 60% of our second quarter product revenues coming from outside the US and 41% coming from OEM customers.   ", " ", "In the third quarter, we expect demand for our products to grow at a modest pace, with growth primarily from OEM mobile customers.  Industry bit supply is expected to also grow at a modest pace in the third quarter, as idle wafer capacity has largely returned to production and technology conversions will continue as well.  We expect approximately 50% of our captive bit output in the third quarter to be on three bits per cell architecture X3 on 43 nanometer technology.  Our 32 nanometer transition has begun and we expect to ramp its production over the next several quarters.  ", "Overall, we expect to sustain a highly competitive product cost in 2009 and 2010 in our captive supply base.  ", " ", "Since early July, we have been running our captive fab capacity at full utilization, however, our inventory is still on the high side and we may cut back the fab utilization rate late in the year or early next year, should the expected pickup in holiday sales fail to materialize.   ", " ", "The key to returning to sustained profitability is for the industry supply to closely track industry demand, as has been the case in the past six months, when industry-wide production cuts brought supply in line with demand.  In the prior four years, the NAND industry had invested in substantial new wafer fab capacity to satisfy strong growth in demand from new markets.  Some of these markets are maturing and growing at a slower rate, while new markets, such as solid-state drives, are still in their early days and their future bit growth trajectories will be closely tied to pricing that, except for enterprise SSD, may not deliver attractive margins, at least not initially.  ", "Excluding the relatively modest investments in technology transitions, large scale investments in new NAND wafer capacity will require forward visibility of strong demand from new markets coupled with sustained profitability to provide attractive return on investment, and we believe that such conditions may be several quarters away from where existing NAND markets are today. ", " ", "As for SanDisk, we are steadily increasing our participation in the very large flash OEM market.  Our embedded flash business team, that pioneered the mDoc product line, is now fielding a strong lineup of bootable managed NAND components and these are being designed into top-tier handsets and smartphones, GPS, digital camcorders, MP3 players and numerous other portable devices.  ", "In bundled cards, we are a significant supplier to all the top handset OEMs that support a card slot in their phones.  Smartphones are, of course, bucking the declining trend of the rest of the handset market and are growing at a hefty pace, led by Apple, RIM and Nokia, but with other contenders in the wings, including Palm and a slew of Android-based phones.  Recent iPhone announcements from Apple clearly show that highly capable smartphones need to have at least 8 gigabytes of storage capacity, even in $99 phones, with the high-end phones requiring as much as 32 gigabytes.  In addition, third party applications ported on these devices are rapidly proliferating, and are expected to drive the demand for high capacity of mobile flash storage.  ", " ", "Mobile network operators are also becoming a fast growing part of our business. We recently announced our Service Delivery Card, SDC, which is targeted specifically at the network operators, and is designed to work symbiotically with their SIM cards.  The SDC offers large incremental storage capacities, security and other features and applications aimed at increasing ARPU and reducing customer churn for the operators.  We are pleased with the progress we are making on these initiatives and the early interest we are seeing from the operators. ", " ", "In other areas, we launched our slotRadio player and cards in RadioShack late in the second quarter and expect to expand their availability for the holiday sales season.   ", " ", "I want to say a few words about our SSD business.  Our development efforts are currently directed towards SSDs for notebooks and netbook PCs.  These SSD target markets are highly price elastic, and the recent NAND component price increases have slowed down market adoption rates.  To date our performance in the notebook PC market has been less than stellar, and we have some catching up to do.  We are late to market with the G3 MLC SSD product that we showed at the January CES and we are evaluating our G3 product strategy.  ", "On the other hand, our modular SSD, also known as SanDisk pSSD, has been well received by the leading players in the netbook PC space.  Here our competition is entry level low-cost hard-disk drives.  We expect to sell in the range of a million units this year, still a small part of our revenues, but an encouraging start nonetheless.  Long term, our unique SSD IP, our managed NAND know-how, and our high quality captive NAND, provide us the opportunity to participate profitably in this emerging business. ", " ", "Moving to IP matters, in the second quarter we announced with Samsung the renewal of our patent cross license and flash supply agreements.  The satisfactory conclusion of these lengthy negotiations has provided market certainty about our IP monetization.  ", " ", "On June 30, the Wall Street Journal published the Patent Board Semiconductor Patent Scorecard showing SanDisk moving up to fourth position among the top 166 semiconductor companies, and also rating our innovations as number one in highest industry impact and number one in highest research intensity.  This recognition reflects our investments in NAND scaling, including X3 and X4, 3D Read/Write technology, advanced controllers and embedded and card solutions.  ", " ", "One other point, relating to industry standard formats.  After a decade of relentless evangelizing, we believe that the Secure Digital SD format has now become the de-facto standard for universal storage of consumer content, photos, video, music, maps and games.  Apple\u2019s latest MacBook PCs for the first time features an SD card slot.  Fuji and Olympus appear to be transitioning their new camera models to the SD format from their proprietary xD-Picture Card and most digital SLR cameras now support high performance SD cards as well.  ", "We believe that our microSD card has likewise become the de-facto format in mobile phones.  We are proud of our leading role in creating, propagating and broadly licensing these open standards, which are very good for consumers worldwide, and it should have also positive implications for our future royalties. ", "  ", "Just a small footnote, if you would allow me, in the history of imaging, on June 22nd Kodak announced that it will retire its iconic KodaChrome film, bringing this exquisite innovation to the end of the road of chemical film after almost a century of unchallenged dominance.  ", " ", "In summary, our second quarter results demonstrate that we have executed well in a challenging economic environment.  Of course, like everyone else, we are hopeful that market conditions will improve in the second half of the year.  However, we are managing our business prudently and our focus remains on continued profitable growth.  ", " ", "I will turn it over now to Judy.   ", "Judy Bruner", "Thank you, Eli. Our strategy to reduce captive supply and prioritize profitability over volume worked very well in the second quarter.  On last quarter\u2019s call I indicated that increasing pricing would likely impact the growth we have historically seen in second quarter unit sales and average capacity, and that was indeed the case.  In the second quarter, our unit sales decreased 6% sequentially as we chose not to pursue low price bids.  And the average capacity of our units sold fell 2% sequentially, showing that elasticity works in both directions.  ", "However with a 12% increase in ASP per gigabyte, our product revenue increased 4% sequentially, and the impact on gross margins was particularly positive, although margins are not yet where they need to be. ", " ", "Retail sales made up 59% and OEM 41% of our Q2 product revenue, the same mix as in Q1.  We increased prices in both channels, and unit sales were slightly down sequentially in both channels.  On a year-over-year basis, our unit sales were up 3%, with unit sales of mobile handset memory products and USB products both growing faster than the average.  Unit sales of imaging card products were up very slightly year over year, while gaming cards were down. ", " ", "License and royalty revenue was $120 million compared to our estimate of $85 million to $95 million.  The increase over our guidance came primarily from higher prices than we had estimated in our first quarter licensee sales.   ", " ", "Non-GAAP product gross profit for Q2 was $134 million or 22% of product revenue, up from minus 11% in Q1.  Second quarter product gross profit included a net release of inventory reserves of $83 million, compared to a net release of $34 million in the first quarter.  The inventory reserves released were largely LCM reserves, or lower of cost or market reserves taken in 2008 for product that has now been sold in the second quarter.  ", "Q2 results also included a benefit of $4 million related to fab underutilization charges being less than previously recorded.  There were no new charges for fab underutilization as we are now running our captive capacity at 100%.  ", "Excluding the $87 million benefit from release of inventory reserves and reduced underutilization costs, our underlying non-GAAP product gross margin was a positive $47 million or 7.7% of product revenue, a significant improvement over the past several quarters.   ", " ", "Non-GAAP operating expenses of $160 million in Q2 were up $10 million from Q1 due primarily to increased retail merchandising costs, as we had forecasted.  Expenses were less than forecasted in all areas due to strong expense management and the delay of certain expenditures. ", " ", "Non-GAAP Other Income of $18 million was above our previous forecast due to several one-time gains.  Excluding the one-time items, other income would have been approximately $10 million. ", " ", "Our year-to-date non-GAAP tax rate is 35%, which results in a lower rate for Q2 since the first quarter loss was originally benefited at a rate of only 28%.  ", "With this year-to-date tax catch-up, the Q2 non-GAAP tax rate is 26%, resulting in a one-time benefit to Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $0.05.  ", " ", "On the balance sheet, cash and short and long-term liquid investments decreased by $45 million to $2.34 billion, and working capital increased by $79 million.  Cash flow used in operations in Q2 was $24 million, a result we are pleased with given that the majority of our license and royalty revenues are received in the first and the third quarters.  ", "Cash used for capital and other non-cash investments in Q2 was a net of $22 million.  We loaned $52 million to Flash Alliance for fab equipment and we invested $16 million in non-fab CapEx.  Partially offsetting these investments, we received $53 million in loan repayment from Flash Partners as that joint venture generated more cash than was needed for equipment investments. ", "Our inventory balance declined by $25 million to $527 million, primarily driven by memory cost reduction, partially offset by the reduction in inventory reserves.  ", "Our Yen-based off-balance sheet equipment lease obligations remained approximately constant in U.S. dollar value at $1.2 billion as principal payments made in the second quarter were offset by an appreciation of the yen to the dollar.", "I\u2019ll now turn to forward-looking commentary.  Please note that non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation tables are posted on our website for all applicable guidance.   ", " ", "We currently believe that industry pricing is likely to be stable to modestly down in the second half of the year, and within SanDisk, we will continue to emphasize profitable market share.  We are forecasting total revenue for Q3 between $725 million and $775 million, including license and royalty revenue between $110 million and $115 million.  Remember that our new Samsung license agreement goes into effect mid-August and it will start impacting our license and royalty revenue from the second half of Q4 2009. ", " ", "We expect our Q3 non-GAAP product gross margin exclusive of inventory reserve fluctuations to be similar to slightly higher than the 7.7% underlying margin in Q2.   ", "Based on our forecast of future pricing and cost reduction, we expect a net release of LCM reserves in the third quarter as we sell through previously reserved inventory.  Including the impact of inventory reserve adjustments, we anticipate Q3 non-GAAP product gross margin to be between 15% and 20%.  ", "In terms of underlying cost reduction for 2009, we are forecasting to be at the higher end of our previously forecasted range of 40% to 50%, with strong product cost reduction in the fourth quarter.  ", "In terms of reserve adjustments, after Q3 we expect a reduced benefit from selling through previously reserved inventory. ", " ", "We forecast Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses of $170 million to $180 million and for the full year, we now expect operating expenses to be between $660 million and $680 million, down from our previous estimates. ", "We expect non-GAAP other income for Q3 of approximately $10 million, and we forecast the non-GAAP tax rate to be 35%. ", " ", "Our total capital investment forecast remains at $500 million for 2009, and approximately two-thirds of this capital investment is being funded by the return of cash in 2009 from previous investments, including $53 million of loan repayment from Flash Partners in Q2, $13 million from FlashVision wind-down in Q1 and the $277 million of cash received from the joint venture restructuring in the first quarter.   ", " ", "In summary, we are pleased with the improvement in our operating results in the second quarter.  Our pricing actions in an improved industry environment together with our continued reduction of product costs and our control of operating expenses and capital investments have resulted in a cash and liquidity position significantly better than we anticipated at the beginning of this year.  Moving forward, we are focused on sustainable profitability and returning to positive free cash flow. ", " ", "We\u2019ll now open the call for your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first question from Gary Hsueh with Oppenheimer.", "Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer", "Thanks for taking my question. I just have a quick question here about your ability to be more disciplined in terms of pricing and walking way from lower gross margin business -- why is that trend in terms of your guidance really not continuing or extending into the September/December quarters? And what was particular in the June quarter that basically instigated this?", "Judy Bruner", "Well, I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s not continuing. I\u2019m not sure what you are pointing to in my remarks. We will continue to be targeting profitable market share. I did indicate that our expectation for the industry is that pricing will be stable to modestly down in the second half. We forecast this in part because in recent times, capacity has come back online for the industry and so we expect there is somewhat higher bp growth in the second half than in the first half of 2009 and that that may impact industry pricing in the second half. ", "I have not given a specific pricing forecast for SanDisk for the second half but we are very focused on targeting profitable market share. ", "Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer", "Okay, great and just one quick follow-up here if I may, just on the growth in the mobile business -- I was wondering if you guys could basically help explain your market share on bundled microSD or SD cards in general that come with mobile phones? And also your market share on the embedded flash applications, particularly smartphones and how you segue from basically a more bundled approach to now I think increasingly a more kind of embedded smartphone approach in terms of that business. ", "Eli Harari ", "Okay, so on the bundled cards, of course this is a very big part of our mobile business. Both the microSD as well as the M2, which is the equivalent of microSD for Sony Ericsson phones -- I believe that we are the largest supplier of bundled cards to the top 10 handset vendors. Of course, Apple doesn\u2019t have a card slot so -- but other than that, I believe every other major handset vendor supports microSD and are a customer of ours. ", "I would say that with the -- the one impact of the higher prices that we have seen in the last four or five months, the impact in the OEM space has been that the bundled cards are trending to lower densities, lower capacities -- in other words, the OEMs have a certain budget for cards and if the price goes up, they just reduce the capacity. And in fact if you take a look at the market today, there\u2019s tremendous shortages of 1-gigabyte microSD because business that used to be 2-gigabyte is going to one because of that pricing. ", "But we are very strong in this market and we see some of that market actually going to the mobile network operators who would like to see higher capacity cards and the question is do they buy the phone bundled with the card or do they buy it -- buy the card directly from us. And some of that is happening. ", "As far as the embedded space, as I\u2019ve said in my prepared remarks, I am very, very pleased with the progress that we have been making in penetration with variants of our INAND. INAND is a managed NAND that is a bootable device that really eliminates the requirements for a NOR Flash to boot up and that standardization in the industry is moving in the direction of EMMC, which is EMC is 4.3 and 4.4 as well as ESV, and we are definitely the vanguard of that standardization and I think that many of the phones, we see 4-gigabyte, 8-gigabyte support these kind of products and we are in very, very good design position with some of the key players. ", "So I think that this is an area of good growth potential for us and we\u2019ve been very good in moving the market from mDoc, which was more on the low density to the INAND, which is much more high density. We are not participating in the multi-chip package which requires mobile DRAM combination with sometimes NOR, sometimes NAND. We think that that market, although very, very large, is not where we play to our strengths. ", "Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer", "Great. Thanks for that detailed answer. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Paul Coster with J.P. Morgan.", "Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan", "Eli, I wonder if you could just talk us through what your target gross margins are, and if you can\u2019t do that, at least a road map that takes us forward from this sort of 7% to 8% level back to a level that is consistent with your objective of sustainable profitability -- what are the events that get us there?", "Judy Bruner", "Paul, let me start with that question -- as I said in my prepared remarks, we believe that in the third quarter, the underlying product gross margin is likely to be similar to somewhat better than the 7.7% that we experienced in the second quarter. ", "In the fourth quarter, we expect to experience very strong product cost reduction and that should be a significant help to the underlying product cost, or to the underlying product gross margin. ", "But as I\u2019ve said for some time now, it takes several quarters of cost reduction exceeding price reduction for us to rebuild our product gross margins. But we think we are off to a good start and the 7.7% is quite a bit better than we experienced in the last several quarters and we were actually quite pleased with that outcome for Q2. ", "So we are taking our guidance one quarter at a time right now but we feel good about the path that we are on. ", "Eli Harari ", "Let me be a little bit more -- put our name on the line, if you will -- you know, this really needs to get back to the 20% to 30% product gross margin that we had in prior years and we are not there yet but we believe we know what needs to happen. Some of that is under our control and some is not under our control. What is, of course, not under our control is new capacity coming on-stream, you know, premature to the demand but we have no control of that. ", "Right now, things look certainly for the next several quarters, look like a good balance between demand and supply and I am hopeful that we can continue to improve our product gross margins and get them to where they need to be in order to make this a healthy business, where one can contemplate further investments. ", "Paul, did you have a follow-up?", "Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan", "I did, thank you. Are there specific technology sort of step function changes there, the 30X nanometer, four bit per cell, that you can sort of project out the timeframe for them having, sort of bringing about the relative cost advantage for you in the industry?", "Eli Harari ", "Well, we\u2019ve said last time that X3 gives you a 15% to 20% lower cost, basically a 15% to 20% gross margin advantage. Of course, if everybody had X3 for all their products and yielding and applied across their products, then that advantage goes away. But basically, and X4 goes further than of course the X3 and we are definitely driving in that direction. ", "But another area really is to drive the differentiation and to drive the brand and to gain an incremental product margins not just on costs and not just on commodity, you know, my price is 10% lower than yours and therefore I get the business. ", "And we are finding that we can in fact do some of that, that we can walk away from business and that our customers do value our brand and are prepared to pay us a premium for that. ", "Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Daniel Berenbaum with Ariga U.S.A.", "Daniel Berenbaum - Ariga U.S.A.", "Thanks for taking my call. Can you talk a little bit about the royalty revenue and what drove the upside to your guidance there? And then maybe just help me put in perspective the changes that have gone on at your licensees with reducing capacity and is there a way that we can think about, if I look back, and I recognize you are not going to want to give guidance but if you think about looking back to where your peak license revenue was in Q3 of \u201908, can we get back to that number in a reasonable time frame with all of the changes that have gone on with your licensees, or think about maybe what the maximum theoretical license revenue is or help me understand around that. ", "Judy Bruner", "Let me address the upside to the guidance that I provided last quarter, as a starting point -- you might recall that last quarter, when we did our earnings release and I provided guidance, there had not been a release at that point in time from some of our major licensees. So clearly this is a number that we have estimate without much guidance and when we did hear results from major licensees, we heard that there had been quite a bit more price increase at the component level in the first quarter than we had anticipated or included in our forecast. And that really is the primary thing that drove the upside to our guidance. ", "And you might recall that our license and royalty revenue was fairly soft in the first quarter, so I would also add that we were probably conservative, perhaps a little gun-shy after the first quarter result. ", "In terms of your second question, you know, in terms of what is the maximum, keep in mind that the third quarter that we just gave guidance for is really the last quarter of what I might call status quo older license agreements and our new Samsung agreement will begin to impact our license and royalty revenue in the fourth quarter, impacting half of the fourth quarter and then all of 2010 and beyond. ", "And the best way for me to help you in terms of estimating is to say that historically over the last few years, the Samsung license and royalty revenue for us has ranged between about two-thirds and three-quarters of our total license and royalty revenue and we estimate that the all-in royalty rate of our new agreement will be effectively approximately half of the all-in rate of the older agreement. ", "Eli Harari ", "Yeah, but that assumes that that\u2019s the end of it, that we will never have anymore royalties from any other source and I would not use that assumption. For one, I\u2019ve just told you that SD and microSD are now I believe the global standards and I believe their volume in future years could go up quite substantially from where it is today and we area  co-sharer of royalties collected on these cards. ", "And this is just one example and we also believe that we have a very valuable IP in the area of solid state disk, so I think that you are looking at a point in time and we -- of course, we have to deliver, I mean, we have to prove through actions greater royalties but overall, I think that the IP portfolio is very powerful as -- again, I\u2019ve just pointed out that The Wall Street Journal considered us to be the most impactful IP portfolio, the most impactful in our industry. ", "Daniel Berenbaum - Ariga U.S.A.", "Absolutely -- and then maybe I can just sneak in one more on a different topic, in terms of OpEx -- you guys have done a great job managing costs and I know that some of the cost reductions now that the Samsung negotiation is complete, but when you look at your traditional advertising spend as you get into the back-to-school and Christmas, are you giving up anything there and do you think that there\u2019s -- you know, what\u2019s the trade-off? Help me understand just how you thinking about that?", "Judy Bruner", "Well, I mean, you can see from the expense guidance that I provided today that there is a lift in the expenses in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, with the year still being quite a bit less than we had originally guided at the beginning of the year. So  we are increasing our spending in the latter part of the year in merchandising and in some forms of advertising. I mean, clearly we are not spending on anywhere near what one might consider a full-blown advertising campaign but we do have some merchandising expenses built into that. ", "So we think we\u2019ve found the right balance, at least for this year, in this demand environment.", "Daniel Berenbaum - Ariga U.S.A.", "Okay, great. Thanks very much. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Uche Orji with UBS.", "Uche Orji - UBS", "Thank you very much. Eli, let me just ask you about how you plan to drive bit growth, just in case the recovery we\u2019ve seen in the market continues -- you are not raising CapEx and you are running at 100% utilization rate, so obviously the only choice, way to drive bit growth is by shrink. So can you talk about where you are in terms of shrink, 32-nanometer transition, how much volume now, and what is the roadmap?", "Eli Harari ", "We are well along, as I said, in the 32-nanometer transition and that will -- I think about early in the year in February, we announced our 32-nanometer, 32-gigabyte, three bits per cell X3 chip, I think 113-millimeter squared, which is smaller than any other chip out there in 32-nanometer or in any other technology. We expect that technology to be in production this year. ", "And we are bringing up on 43-nanometer both additional X3 capacity as well as X4 capacity, and we are -- so both the 43-nanometer and the 32-nanometer are transitioning as best we can, as much as we can, because our customers will still need the two bits per cell and some applications that needed two bits per cell. We are moving as much as we can to three bits and a little bit later in the year to four bits per cell. ", "Next year we will be mostly in 32-nanometer -- perhaps half of it in two bits and half in three bits per cell, and I expect that before the end of next year, we will be in what we call the 2X technology, and we are in development of the technology beyond that.   ", "So as I\u2019ve said in the past, we always kind of like three generations in development and the third generation always kind of looks like we are going to fall off the cliff from the point of your scaling but as we get closer to that edge of that cliff, we see actually there is a little bit more runway. So I\u2019m a little bit more optimistic now on being able to scale NAND beyond 20-nanometer. That of course would be very good for extending the life of our existing capital investments and generating more bits. ", "But there\u2019s a lot of work to be done and of course, every generation, as we scale down, we need more and more system support, more and more sophisticated algorithms and more powerful error correction and this is really the strength that we bring to the party. ", "So we have a very holistic approach to driving the technology and the technology goes with the algorithms of the controller that we are driving together with Toshiba -- very, very hard, the technology scaling. ", "There is, of course, beyond the 20-nanometer a very big, very, very big challenge which is the UV. That is a challenge for the entire industry or at least for those companies, very few companies that can afford to even think about it but that is certainly something that we are beginning to take very seriously. ", "In addition to that, of course, we have a full blown effort on the 3D read write because eventually NAND will come to the end of its economic scaling and at that point, we hope to have 3D read write.  ", "So it\u2019s a very, very substantial program, a tremendous amount of energy and passion and innovation and invention and it\u2019s part of really what makes us feel that this technology has just so much potential ahead of it. ", "I think for SSD, for example, we are really within two generations from making this thing even on the cost side a different kind of value proposition. At the same time, you are seeing the tremendous improvements, very rapid improvements and benefits of SSD with Flash in terms of performance. So it\u2019s not just meeting the required costs but it\u2019s also demonstrating the performance advantages over hard disk drive and I think that that more than anything else will convince consumers that it\u2019s time to switch. ", "Jay Iyer", "Uche, do you have a follow-up?", "Uche Orji - UBS", "Yes, I do -- I mean, you talked about SSD in the last comment. When you talk about making a different kind of value proposition, I mean, right now at 120 gig SSD is too -- on retail is still priced around $300 against less than $50 for a hard disk drive. So from your surveys of customers, how do you think the value proposition is going to be compelling? Do you think if we get below $100 for 120 gig, it takes off regardless of the delta with hard disk drives? I mean, how should we think about -- what do you know in terms of how the customers think about this that will lead this to trigger an adoption?", "Eli Harari ", "Well, it\u2019s very important to meet consumer price points or perceived requirements of price points but it\u2019s also important to make this a profitable business. And if the business is not profitable for the manufacturers because the cost just isn\u2019t there to satisfy consumer price points, then nobody is going to build a factory to manufacture all of this Flash. ", "So the key is that the industry, the solid state drive industry really needs to emphasize the other attributes of Flash memory primarily speed, performance, responsiveness, ruggedness and so on, power [inaudible], low noise and so on, so that -- because I believe that once the industry achieves that, even at the price point that is higher than what consumers would like to have, I believe that consumers once they use a notebook computer with such a device will never want to go back to a hard disk drive, even if it\u2019s given away for free. ", "Uche Orji - UBS", "Thank you very much. ", "Eli Harari ", "Now, you know, I could be wrong but time will tell. I\u2019m telling you that some of the projections that I\u2019ve seen from independent market analysts that say that the Flash memory will reach ridiculously low price points by 2013 or so and that sort of takes for the SSD market to take off, there is no math in the world that I can think of that will have anybody build a wafer that generates those kind of prices in this timeframe. ", "So it may mean that the SSD market takes longer to develop, that it takes five years instead of three years. In some markets, in the enterprise, of course, it\u2019s ready to go because pricing is not an issue and performance is absolutely there. All I\u2019m saying is that this is -- really what I am saying is that the SSD is a tremendous opportunity. Eventually it will consumer a third to a half of the total bits of either NAND or another technology with 3D read write. Huge, huge volume but it will require that the manufacturers can achieve profitability, not just that the -- it should not be parity with hard disk drive. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to James Covello with Goldman Sachs.", "James Covello - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you so much for taking the question -- a lot of good questions asked already. I really want to focus a little bit more on the royalty, kind of looking forward. Eli, you talked about how this, we\u2019re looking at a snapshot in time on the royalty and there\u2019s incremental opportunity in SD and microSD and you think you have good solid state drive technology -- what about Micron? It would seem like all the other major OEMs now with Samsung and Hynix licensing and Toshiba and Intel obviously having cross-licensed, Micron is the one major producer OEM who is not -- who doesn\u2019t either have a cross-license or is not paying you a royalty and that would seem like an increasingly significant opportunity for you. ", "Eli Harari ", "Yeah, it\u2019s true, nothing has changed there. Micron is not licensed and I believe that\u2019s a problem for them. And that\u2019s all I can say. ", "James Covello - Goldman Sachs", "And your strategy in the past has been kind of wait until someone who you think is in violation gets big enough and then pursue litigation to make the litigation costs worthwhile, like maybe you did with ST Micro years ago before they got out of the business. I mean, is that a similar kind of strategy here?", "Eli Harari ", "Again, I am not going to tip our hand on what our strategy is with regard to Micron or anybody else. ", "James Covello - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. I mean, I guess I\u2019m just -- what\u2019s preventing you from trying to get them to pay a license? It\u2019s not -- I mean, they are not paying, they should be paying, so that\u2019s not trade secrets. ", "Judy Bruner", "Jim, we really can\u2019t address legal strategy and IP strategy in our comments here.", "James Covello - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. All right, thanks very much. I appreciate it. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.", "Edwin Mok - Needham & Company", "Thanks for taking my question. My first question on the cost, just a clarification that Judy mentioned that you expect more substantial cost savings in the fourth quarter. Is it because you guys are ramping? I think you mentioned or Eli mentioned that you would expect X3 to be 60% of production. Is that why you expect the cost savings, because X3 is ramping this quarter? That will translate to the following quarter?", "Judy Bruner", "It is really the timing of the technology mix over the course of the year, and it\u2019s a combination of the mix of X3, which has been ramping and it\u2019s also starting late this year, starting to see a bit of benefit from 32-nanometer. But remember that there is a lag in our business model and that what you see hit our P&L in any given quarter is probably the result of production two quarters prior to that, given the supply chain lag, the inventory, and then our sell-through revenue recognition. And I\u2019ve actually been saying for some time that the timing of that product cost reduction this year is such that it was very strong in the first quarter and would be reducing but not as strongly in the second and third quarter and then very strong again in the fourth quarter. ", "Edwin Mok - Needham & Company", "Great, and then one question on your utilization charge -- I think in the first quarter, you guys had $63 million  in the utilization, and I think you guys had mentioned that your fab utilization around 70% for the second quarter, that\u2019s how you determined that charge. ", "I was wondering if demand has softened maybe towards December or towards first quarter of 2010, do you expect to dial back on your production and do you expect that kind of charge to potentially hit in your fourth quarter?", "Judy Bruner", "As Eli said, if demand is not as strong as we are expecting, particularly in the holiday period, then we could choose to run our captive capacity at less than full utilization and if we were to do that, you\u2019re right, there would be a charge that we would take related to that under-utilization. ", "The charge, as I think you know that we took in the first quarter, which was as you said, the $63 million, was for our estimate of the cost of the under-utilization in the second quarter. And now in the second quarter, we are not including any -- we did not have any charge in the second quarter because we are running our fabs at 100% capacity in the third quarter. ", "Edwin Mok - Needham & Company", "Great, that was very helpful, thanks for clarifying that. And finally, just one question on the SSD -- Eli, you mentioned that there seems to be some good demand on industrial SSD and I think historically, M-system was actually a strong play in that space and you mentioned that you guys have strengthened your embedded team and working with the mobile sector. Any thought about going  after the current embedded SSD or I should say industrial or enterprise type SSD market, given that it\u2019s a good market?", "Eli Harari ", "We are currently not in that market and you cannot be in that market kind of like causally. You are either in it or not. So today we are not in this market, as I said. If we were to be in that market, it would be through partnership with other partners that are entrenched in the enterprise space, not so much in the industrial space. The industrial space, we have been in, M-system we have been in and it\u2019s just too small a market. ", "Edwin Mok - Needham & Company", "I see. Great, thanks for clarifying that. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "Thanks for taking the questions. Eli, just  the first question on the comments for potentially moderating utilization late this year if we get some sloppy supply in-demand dynamics, has SanDisk discussed with its manufacturing partner the possibility of doing so? And if your partner didn\u2019t want to throttle back utilization, would SanDisk still be able to do that with -- ", "Eli Harari ", "Well, of course, we can\u2019t discuss what we are discussing with a partner but we do have the flexibility to ask unilaterally, of course, we would inform them of that and give them advanced notice and in fact, may offer them that capacity if they were interested in that. ", "There was a -- at the Apple announcement yesterday, Apple I believe said that they have prepaid Toshiba $500 million, and I\u2019m just quoting public information, so clearly at least Apple thinks that they are going to be in need of guaranteed capacity, so -- and obviously Apple is a major consumer of Flash, so we\u2019ll see. ", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "Okay, fair enough -- switching gears to inventory, Judy, can you provide some color on where you would like on-hand inventory to be, both exiting the third quarter and if you can provide any color on where you would be comfortable exiting the year, that would be helpful as well. ", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. So as we\u2019ve said, the inventory levels are still higher than we\u2019d like them to be. Our inventory levels at present are slightly more than a quarter\u2019s worth of inventory and given our vertically integrated supply chain, a good level is probably something in the neighborhood of nine to 10 weeks. We think that it\u2019s possible we could be around that level around the end of this year and we anticipate year-end, it\u2019s very possible we could need non-captive supply in 2010. ", "However, let me point out to you that in dollar terms, it\u2019s very possible that the inventory dollars will increase on the balance sheet in the third quarter because one, we are running our capacity at full capacity and two, we expect that we will be releasing additional reserves as that inventory sells through. ", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then I\u2019m not sure if the last comment -- ", "Eli Harari ", "Let me just clarify something, Craig -- when Judy talks about a total inventory, that is including what\u2019s in the production line, in unfinished wafers. ", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "Okay, got it. ", "Judy Bruner", "Yes, it includes raw materials, WIP, finished goods, and in fact it includes inventory in OEM hubs that we hold for some of our OEM customers and it includes some inventory in the retail channel, which was held on a consignment basis. So we have a fairly long supply chain, vertical supply chain. ", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "Yes, a lot there -- Judy, can you clarify the company wrote off, I believe, $370 million worth of product in 2008 and I think through the first quarter of 2009, how much of that has been reversed or sold back? I think about $100 million -- is that correct? And so is the balance left to go? How do we look at that opportunity to resell previously written down inventory?", "Judy Bruner", "Well, in the first half, we have released net reserves of $34 million in the first quarter and $83 million in the second quarter, so $117 million of net reserve. And so you\u2019re right, there is still a sizable amount of reserve that is left on the balance sheet. We expect that we will release a fair amount of reserve in the third quarter but again, it will depend on how much sells through and the net impact to the P&L will depend on what the pricing outlook for the future is and what new reserves, if anything, are needed. And then we expect there will be some release in the fourth quarter as well, but probably at a declining amount. ", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "Thanks for taking all the questions. ", "Jay Iyer", "Thanks, Craig. Jamie, we\u2019ll take one more question. ", "Operator", "That final question will come from Bob Gujavarty with Deutsche Bank.", "Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks for squeezing me in and appreciate all the color around inventory reserves. That\u2019s very helpful. ", "I\u2019m just curious what you are seeing in the retail channel -- is it a little bit too early to look at back-to-school? Are you comfortable with your retail inventory? What are you seeing from that channel?", "Judy Bruner", "You know, I\u2019ll say that we are quite comfortable with our retail channel inventory levels. We ended the second quarter with channel inventory between seven and eight weeks and that\u2019s about the right level for us. ", "It\u2019s really too early to comment on Q3 back-to-school sell-through trends. We just provided the revenue guidance for Q3 today. ", "Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, fair enough and just a quick follow-up -- I looked back on 3Q last year, OEM was about 37% compared to retail at 63 -- we\u2019re already at 41, 59, and you suggested OEM would be growing as a percentage of mix in 3Q -- any range you could provide on what you think, how high that can get in 3Q?", "Eli Harari ", "The OEM, we expect to be the star of the third quarter, the strong performer in the third quarter, so you\u2019re right, it will -- it should increase in percentage. ", "Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Fair enough. Thanks. ", "Jay Iyer", "Thanks, Bob. ", "Operator", "And that does conclude today\u2019s\u2019 question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to you, Mr. Iyer, for any additional or closing remarks. ", "Jay Iyer", "Great, thank you. Thank you all for joining us on the call today.

Welcome to Western Digital's fourth quarter financial results for fiscal year 2009. (Operator Instructions) Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin. ", "Bob Blair", "Thank you. I would like to mention that we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning our inventory levels; industry conditions and demand; our gross margin and operating expense model; our future investments in technology, products and processes; our future product offerings and market segment participation; our cash usage; our expected capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization and tax rate for fiscal 2010; and our financial results expectations for the September quarter, including revenue, gross margin, expenses, tax rate, share count, and earnings per share.

", "We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events, and you should not assume later in the quarter that the comments we make today are still valid.", "In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures in our press release included as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 8-K we furnished to the SEC today, a copy of which can be found under the SEC filings link in the Investor Relations section of our Web site at www.westerndigital.com.", "I also want to note that copies of remarks from today\u2019s call will be available on the investors\u2019 section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of this call. ", "I will now turn the call over to Western Digital President and Chief Executive Officer, John Coyne. ", "John Coyne", "Thanks, Bob. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today.  Our fiscal 2009 and June quarter results continue to demonstrate the effectiveness of the WD business model and the passion, nimbleness and capabilities of the WD team.", "In a very challenging year, we were continuously profitable and cash flow positive, despite absorbing $112 million in restructuring charges. As the economic environment deteriorated and impacted hard drive demand in the December quarter, we initiated actions to reduce our fixed cost structure in anticipation of a prolonged downturn in demand, relative to the previous trajectory of the industry. The results of these actions, which were largely completed in the March quarter, are reflected in our strong June quarter results.", " ", "Prompt and effective action by all industry participants quickly brought supply in line with the new demand levels and also dramatically reduced inventory by the end of March to the lowest levels in the last five years.  Inventory has been further reduced in the June quarter with manufacturers\u2019 inventory down from 9 days of sales at the end of March to just 7 days at the end of June, while distribution inventory, already at historically low levels exiting the March quarter, was reduced by a further 1 million units at the end of June.  WD inventories exiting fiscal Q4 remain tightly controlled and have declined a little more than the rest of the industry.", "With the major adjustment of inventory levels now behind us, supply-demand balance restored and all industry participants appearing to be focused on the fundamentals of supply-demand discipline, profitability and cash management, we have seen some moderation in the rate of price erosion in the industry in the first half of calendar 2009. All of this heralds a better industry environment as we head into fiscal 2010. ", "In the recently-completed fourth fiscal quarter the market was much stronger than we originally anticipated in our April conference call which contemplated a market that was flat with the March quarter.  Actual demand was up 18% quarter over quarter at 132 million units and flat with the prior year period.", "In this environment, we used our adaptability and responsiveness with telling effect, as we capitalized on this unexpected market upside, which we promptly converted into financial results that significantly exceeded expectations. This included a return to our targeted gross margin and operating expense business model parameters.", "Customer preference for WD\u2019s quality, reliability, product breadth and responsiveness drove record shipments of 40 million units, up 27% sequentially and 14% over the prior year period. Revenue of $1.9 billion was up 21% sequentially but down 3% year-on-year.  ", "Reflecting the damage done by a year of extraordinary industry price declines, year\u2013on-year ASPs were down $8 to $48, while gross and net margins were down 210 and 50 basis points respectively.  ", "However, sequentially gross and net margins improved by 330 and 710 basis points to 19.2% and 10.2% respectively, while our ASP erosion of $2 in the quarter reflects both a moderation in like-for-like pricing pressure and a WD mix-shift to take advantage of volume opportunities in the emerging Netbook market. ", "Our ability to make acceptable margins at the low end of the market, while at the same time returning to our targeted gross margin and operating expense model, speaks to our advantaged cost structure.", "We remain convinced of a continuing long term increase in demand for digital content storage. However, it remains difficult to predict the short and medium term influence of the continuing recession on true demand and historical seasonality. While we expect that the current quarter will provide continuing sequential growth, we are vigilant about macro economic developments that may lead to some choppiness in demand over the next several quarters.  Consequently, we continue to supplement our customer demand forecasts with close monitoring of industry inventory, production and sales data and remain focused on further refining WD\u2019s ability to adjust supply quantity and mix by product and regional market to ensure that we best serve our customer needs while we optimize our revenues and margins and continue our quest for sustained profitable growth.", "Our strategy to focus on the industry\u2019s highest growth sectors of external storage and mobile PCs, combined with our intense emphasis on quality, cost and efficiency in both manufacturing and engineering, continued to pay dividends as our technology and product leadership in these high-growth markets served us well in fiscal 2009 and positions us well as we advance into the new fiscal year.", "Our consistent profitability and asset management have generated the strongest balance sheet in the industry.  This has enabled us to continue to make substantial investments in the technology, products and processes needed to maintain the momentum we have been building over these last few years. Indeed, despite the fixed cost reductions we made mid-year, we have increased our R&D investments year-on-year.  ", "Likewise, we continue to make prudent, well timed, capital investments to ensure that we have the capability to produce the product volumes which are required by market growth, increasing customer preference for WD\u2019s existing products and to support our plans to further broaden our product offerings and market segment participation in the coming year.", "Throughout fiscal 2009, WD demonstrated increasing returns on its investments in technology, product breadth and production capability, with consistent delivery of compelling first-to-market products.  The company maintained its momentum as an industry innovator with the announcement yesterday of another industry first -- the 1 terabyte My Passport Essential SE external storage device, which utilizes our newest WD Scorpio Blue, the industry\u2019s only 2.5\u201d hard drive with 333 gigabytes per platter.", "For the balance of fiscal 2010 we have very exciting product plans to further enhance our competitive advantage in the segments we have traditionally served. Additionally, we will enter the mainstream enterprise market with a family of 2.5-inch 10,000 RPM SAS hard drives.", "We will extend our WD TV media player product line to further expand this consumer segment. We have entered into an agreement with HP to design and manufacture a range of HP-branded external storage solutions for retail markets, further increasing WD\u2019s reach into the consumer space. In the longer term, we are already engaged in the development of solid state storage solutions for the enterprise market which we expect to launch in fiscal 2011.", "Before I pass the call to Tim Leyden, I want to thank the WD team and our supply partners for outstanding execution in seizing the upside opportunities that emerged in the fourth fiscal quarter and for their responsiveness and commitment throughout a difficult but rewarding year in which we have further strengthened WD in our long term mission of generating sustained profitable growth.", "Tim. ", "Tim Leyden", "Thank you, John. Fiscal 2009 brought macroeconomic challenges for the hard drive industry and for WD but these challenges gave us the opportunity to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace with our financial performance. We have consistently portrayed the WD competitive advantages and capabilities in varying market conditions. These differentiators include our business model, our cost leadership, the adaptability and flexibility of our people, our data driven approach to identifying and satisfying market demands, our ability to make the desired product available to customers when required, and our willingness and capability to invest in R&D, component manufacturing, and capacity in order to broaden our product and production base.", "Our performance in the last two quarters demonstrates these abilities. We are now ideally positioned to leverage these strengths and continue to consolidate our position due to our balance sheet strength and our upside potential in unaddressed markets.", "For our full fiscal year 2009, total revenue was $7.5 billion.

A couple of questions on digging into the second half expectations by market, particularly when you look at the external market, how are you calculating or figuring out what the consumer could be doing in terms of external demand through second half? Any insight there would be helpful. ", "And then secondly, are you assuming that your strength in netbooks continues in the second half of the year?", "John Coyne", "I think we are being a little cautious in the 3% to 6% overall market guidance and we are not really seeing a lot of differentiation in our expectations relative to market segment. On the consumer side, while consumer has been reasonably strong through the first half of the calendar year, we remain concerned that the overall economic environment and potential impacts of that as we go forward, so I\u2019d have to say approaching our view of the market with a little bit of caution but being positioned to take advantage of opportunities as they arise, just like we did last quarter. ", "The netbook question, we anticipate that we will continue to see strength both in netbook and in the new CULV thin and light area. And a general comment about PC, both desktop and mobile, seeing a bit of a mix down, which is a typical reaction to recessionary type environment. ", "Steven Fox - CSLA", "Okay, fair enough. And then just as a follow-up, obviously like you said you responded to demand fairly quickly. Are there any bottlenecks that you had in the last quarter or that you are worried about either with you or industry wide for meeting demand in this current quarter that we should be aware of?", "John Coyne", "Well, I think certainly the level of demand last quarter exceeded industry expectations as well as WD expectations and in order to respond to that, the supply chain responded very rapidly to that up-tick but it did place stresses on the supply chain in general, and so we are running tight in several areas, probably the most notable of those would be glass substrates for the 2.5-inch space, which is the form factor that is showing the most growth. And also typically in these kinds of pull-in situations, you stress the long lead time components, such as semiconductor components. ", "Steven Fox - CSLA", "Got it. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of  Richard Kugele with Needham & Company.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company", "Thank you. Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions -- I guess first in terms of your target margin model, obviously you\u2019ve already both reported a quarter and guided another. When you look at the $600 million of CapEx, given that utilization plays the major role in getting to that point, do you also see you being able to maintain that level going forward throughout at least fiscal 2010?", "Tim Leyden", "So the correlation between capital and margin -- let me take the margin question first. We are obviously pleased to be back in the margin range, in the margin model range. And we did so while shipping a market representative mix, which for us would be a lower mix than historically. But if inventory stays in line and industry participants stay focused on profitability and cash generation, we see ourselves being able to expand into that margin range. ", "From a CapEx viewpoint, we add capital on a just-in-time basis and we are -- and as you can see, we demonstrated that in the fourth quarter as we -- when we saw a market opportunity, we spent a little bit above what our expect capital profile was but we will continue to spend just in time and we are at the moment at the threshold of what our capacity is, because our previous highest shipments were somewhere around 39.6 million. So we continue to do things on a just-in-time basis and we will make adjustments as we go along. ", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company", "And you had in the past commented when it comes to the CapEx how much was kind of devoted for heads. There\u2019s still, if I remember correctly, some portion of spend that\u2019s required to finish that build-out. Can you just remind us on how the $600 million might break out?", "Tim Leyden", "Yeah, if you\u2019ll recall when we started off last year, we had an $800 million capital spending plan and that included about $150 million of 8-inch spending per heads. And while we have actually run the pilot line and improved the process, we haven\u2019t spent the money in order to increase the capacity because we haven\u2019t needed it at this point and it\u2019s not in that $600 million number, so consequently -- but we do expect to stay within our model range, which is 7% to 8% of revenue as we go forward. ", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay, and then just lastly, when it comes to the HP announcement, I don\u2019t know how much you can discuss about that product for the consumer market but it seems to be a little bit unique that you are helping them design this. For a long time, everyone has been supplying many of the vendors the hard drive piece of this but is there anything you can elaborate on that and how you see it playing within your own product line, or what the response is even within the consumer Best Buys of the world and stuff like that?", "John Coyne", "Well, in fact HP have already announced the product line as HP Simple Save, and it will be stocked worldwide in similar channels. HP\u2019s retail channels are similar to our own. We see it as a complementary brand to the strength of the WD brand. We see it as a way to further expand our presence in that marketplace, given the already very significant market share of the WD brand. And we are very happy that we\u2019ve been able to form a strategic partnership with a very well-known worldwide brand, rather than relying on the vagaries of the smaller brands that participate in the external storage market.

", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Thank you. I just wanted to ask, you guys had a 14-week quarter this quarter, and it sounded like from Seagate\u2019s comments that the end of the quarter continued to be strong and there was some question about if business got pulled into the second quarter from the third quarter. I appreciate that you guys have given some conservative guidance for that but I was curious how much of the upside in your units do you think came from that extra week that you had?", "John Coyne", "The last quarter was probably the most linear quarter we\u2019ve had in the history of the company, so you can take the $40 million, divide by 14, you know how much we shipped in the final week. ", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then in terms of the revenue guidance, it seems a little bit more conservative than Seagate. I guess my question would be do you think that your ASP assumptions are slightly different than Seagate? It doesn\u2019t sound like you guys think you are going to gain share, or it is just that you are being conservative and because of the second week that your revenue guidance is a little bit lower?", "John Coyne", "Well, if you take the market growth forecast and adjust upwards for and then adjust down for the 14th and 13th week, they practically cancel each other out and so we are -- with ASP, historical ASP trends in Q1 and with a slight mix-up with -- we get to the numbers that we have. ", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, so it\u2019s really the extra week that impacts that?", "John Coyne", "Yes.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachmann with BMO Capital Markets.", "Keith Bachmann - BMO Capital Markets", "Two things -- the first one for you, John, if I could -- I\u2019m going to ask the same question I asked to Seagate; if I look at what the TAM did in June, as you said it looks like it\u2019s up about 18%. Intel and IDC and others have suggested that the PC market was up anywhere from 3% to 5% in the same June quarter period. Clearly your inventories are in good shape on your books and Seagate\u2019s are as well. How do you respond to some of the challenges that there has to be some extra inventory about potentially at the OEMs?", "John Coyne", "I think you\u2019ve got to bear in mind that the PC sales increase is a PC sales increase. The -- ", "Keith Bachmann - BMO Capital Markets", "Sorry, John, that was the unit number I gave you on PCs. ", "John Coyne", "Yes, unit sales. And we are heading into the back-to-school period which typically gets fulfilled from a system build and ship perspective. The majority of that product is being shipped on ocean and so it\u2019s built in the May June timeframe in order to land to support the late July/August type sales sell-through. So I mean, we are very keenly interested to see the outcome of the back-to-school season because it\u2019s very important to validate what we\u2019ve observed thus far in the year, which is that consumer demand has held up pretty well. ", "So I think back to school is going to be important, relative to understanding what the December quarter supply demand situation is going to look like in order to -- you know, if back to school is strong, then you could anticipate that there will be further demand to support by end of the year typical seasonal situation in PC. If back to school is weak, then obviously some of the systems that were built for back to school will slide to the right a little bit and that could dampen demand as we go into the December quarter. ", "Keith Bachmann - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, fair enough. Let me ask a follow-up then, if I could, for either of you -- there seems to be some issues, as you mentioned, around the availability of glass. John or Tim, is there any view on where you run out of supply? In other words, if the TAM on the 2.5 increases beyond a certain point, I\u2019ve gotten some feedback from even mid-60s in terms of units. Is there some threshold that you think the industry, there just isn\u2019t enough supply of glass to fulfill the 2.5-inch market, depending on the size of the TAM in the September quarter?", "John Coyne", "Well, I mean obviously there\u2019s some number that could create that environment but right now we think there\u2019s -- while supply is tight in the industry from a substrate perspective because there was a lot of capacity taken offline in the December through March period and it\u2019s being put back in a very measured way. I think the real issue is that we work very closely with our supply base to ensure that they understand what the end demand is that we are seeing and that that capacity get brought back online in a timely manner to support the demand. ", "Keith Bachmann - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Thanks very much, John. My final one, Tim, a real quick one for you -- I don\u2019t know if you said this but average ASP in September, is it flat, down, or up you think from 48?", "Tim Leyden", "In September, we expect that price declines will moderate and we expect that there will be a slight mix-up, so consequently it will be flat with an upward bias, we think. ", "Keith Bachmann - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, thanks very much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert\u00a0Cihra with Caris & Company.", "Robert\u00a0Cihra - Caris & Company", "On the product side, I just have two questions, if I could -- one on, or actually sorry a couple on notebook first. With the 333 gigabytes per platter now launched at least in the branded, I guess two questions there -- one, is that three platter configuration, is that kind of just a specialty thing that you see for retail or is that something that could actually become sort of a notebook configuration?", "And then I guess also along the same lines, just with that product now and the retail branded stuff, when do you see that starting to make its way into PCs? And then I have a follow-up, if that\u2019s all right. ", "John Coyne", "Our choice to develop the 1-terabyte, three platter 12.5 millimeter form factor was driven by the size of the external market today and our position within the market and that justified the development of that product, which is primarily targeted at the external storage market. And we\u2019ve seen in the 3.5-inch external storage, the huge demand from 1-terabyte is actually the 3.5-inch capacity point that sells the most units in the external market. ", "And so provide that capacity with the convenience of no power supply and total mobility and portability and we believe you\u2019ve got a winning product in terms of consumer desire. So that was a compelling story for us to go do that development. We thought it was a very significant milestone step in the development of the external storage market, so that\u2019s why we focused on that. ", "However, there are many chassis today and many chassis under development which accommodate the 12.5-millimeter form factor, and so we do expect to supply this product into a segment of the notebook market as well. ", "Meanwhile, we continue to develop a full line of products in the 9.5-millimeter form factor to support the broad-based notebook market. ", "Robert\u00a0Cihra - Caris & Company", "And have you started shipping that yet too, on the notebook side or is that something more in the September quarter or -- ", "John Coyne", "This is Western Digital. We announce products [when we ship in volume]. ", "Robert\u00a0Cihra - Caris & Company", "[You did it on a product], so that\u2019s not actually pushing it. Okay, under the category of waiting to announce products, I guess I will just follow it up with the enterprise SAS product. You did say that fiscal \u201910, you\u2019ll be introducing that -- any -- I mean, care to say anything in terms of timing? Given how long qualification cycles are and that sort of thing, I mean, is that the type of thing where you will talk about [quals] or is it something that you\u2019ll just talk about shipping, or any kind of -- is it something that\u2019s still a calendar -- fiscal \u201910 but calendar 09?", "John Coyne", "Well, again, what we will talk about when we are in volume production shipments of production product, we\u2019ll talk about that.

", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum.", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital", "John, could you just elaborate on your comments in your prepared comments on what your thoughts are for demand over the next few quarters? I think you said that you would expect choppy demand over the next few quarters after a pretty historical linear June quarter. Could you just elaborate on what your thoughts are for the next few quarters?", "John Coyne", "Yeah, I think it\u2019s not so much that I -- we\u2019re concerned that with the overarching economic environment, it\u2019s difficult not to prepare ourselves for a W rather than a V, although we do anticipate that the second dip of the W will be significantly less than the first dip. But I think it would be fantastic but maybe a little unlikely that we are going to see an uninterrupted growth path from here. ", "I think the other thing that we are grappling with a little bit is that certainly since the December quarter, so December, March, and June quarters have all been non-seasonal from a historic, sequential growth or reduction perspective. So we are looking at the September quarter from the perspective of unusual strength in the June quarter, potentially dampening the sequential growth into the September quarter. ", "All that being said, we are spending time talking with customers, listening to their inputs relative to their business and their expectations but we are spending equal time, if not more time, focused on our flexible model that can respond to the real demand as it shows up, and I think the nimbleness of our model should be visible when you look at the fact in April here, we were looking at a market we expected to be flat sequentially that turned into an 18 point opportunity from an overall market point of view. And our execution turned it into substantially more for WD. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital", "Great. In those discussions with your customers, are you getting any feelings of how they would expect the December quarter to play out as it regards to typical seasonality?", "John Coyne", "I think it\u2019s a bit early to go to December. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital", "Great, and then one last question, if I may -- along the same lines of discussions with customers, when are they telling you that they would hope to experience or see or even if they expect an improvement in demand on a PC refresh due to the release of Windows 7?", "John Coyne", "I think most of the commentary we\u2019ve got relative to Windows 7 is more -- more an issue of when businesses begin to spend again in the IT sector. I think it\u2019s -- so the indicator I think will be up-tick in enterprise, followed by kind of PC client system spending in the commercial sector. And I think the more important driver is company confidence about the recovery from the recession than a trigger such as Windows 7. I think Windows 7 may drive a little bit but I think the overarching thing is how are businesses performing in the recovery mode and how rapid is the recovery and how confident are businesses that the recovery is sustainable. And I think that\u2019s going to reflect in refresh much more. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig-Hallum Capital", "Great. Thank you.

Can you give a little bit more detail of any variance by segment within the pricing?", "Tim Leyden", "We don\u2019t actually give out that level of detail, David but if you\u2019ll recall in the last quarter, we indicated that we were driving towards margin model with our different segments, where we were looking at it in three tiers. But the actual top tier is -- consists of enterprise and SSD, the mid tier consists of the consumer, which is PVR, DVR, and branded, and the lower tier consists of netbook, notebook, and desktop. And the reason for that is because the purchasing power of the customers at that particular -- in that particular tier. ", "And we are -- of the fixed tiers we have, there is one that is above the upper end of the margin tier and there is one that is slightly below the lower end of the margin tier at this particular point in time. ", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and then when you think about the gross margin going into the September quarter, you are looking for that to be flat but volumes are going to be up. Is there an offset there that sort of pushes it down a little bit to keep it flat Q-over-Q?", "Tim Leyden", "Well, volumes are going to be pretty much offset by our 14 to 13 week movement. As I indicated, the expectation in the market increase is 3% to 6% and our -- if you convert from 14 weeks to 13 weeks, it offsets -- there\u2019s a downturn of about the same amount. And then we do expect that pricing will moderate. We expect mix to be a little bit better and that\u2019s how we get to the number. ", "David Bailey - Goldman Sachs", "Great. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Aaron\u00a0Rakers with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Aaron\u00a0Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus", "A couple of questions -- I guess I want to understand what you guys are seeing in the 2.5-inch market. If I look at what Seagate said about the TAM, it looks like you guys now could have been right around 30% share in the 2.5-inch market. So can you help us understand what you are seeing from a competitive standpoint, share shifts, and whether you think that you can continue to take share in that 2.5-inch space?", "John Coyne", "Well, I think obviously our results reflects customers who wanted to buy our product. We believe that the availability of that product was one of the critical factors there. We believe that the consistency of our quality, reliability, availability, flexibility in that and competitive overall pricing, and a very strong product portfolio, a very strong company, and a very strong product road map -- we think all of those things play into the strong customer preference for WD and we believe that is sustainable. ", "Aaron\u00a0Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus", "Let me ask it another way -- I mean, I think that we\u2019ve seen some share shifts play themselves out with Fujitsu and Toshiba and that combination now expected to close in August. Would you agree with that and do you believe that there\u2019s further share shifts still to play out from that combination?", "John Coyne", "Yeah, I think the data is shaping up with Seagate, ourselves, and HDST have reported numbers for the quarter and when you look at all of that, it appears that of the three remaining companies, Toshiba, Samsung and Fujitsu, that there has been share loss there. We have to wait for them to report specifics to understand where that share loss has been. ", "Aaron\u00a0Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, fair enough. And then final question for me, on the retail side of the business, if you just -- given what you are disclosing for percentage of revenue, it looks like your revenue was down somewhere around 13% on a sequential basis and that looks like it is a little bit below what we saw out of Seagate. So can you help us understand the sequential pattern in your retail business? Was there any destocking of inventory? Was there any dynamics within that that caused that to be down on a sequential basis mid-teens?", "John Coyne", "Yeah, on a quarter over quarter basis, we did reduce the level of inventory in our branded channel deliberately. The other area to mention, probably in the last 18 months, the branded segment has been the one with the most competitive pricing dynamic across, and five out of those six quarters had double-digit price decline. ", "So while our unit volume is still strong in that area, unsustainable, highly competitive price declines which have been an issue over the last year, a little over a year. The effect of that is that we are maintaining our share in that market and we believe the other drive companies, we think that this whole dynamic is going to change that market significantly into one served primarily by the integrated drive companies. Every drive company in the world now has an active program to go directly to consumer under their own brand name, and so what it appears is  that the smaller companies that are predominantly regional players who buy drives at the component level, their ability to sell gigabytes is compromised when the drive companies go into that market. So they need to find a real value to offer to the consumer, such as some kind of high engineering functionality, the small niche product areas that the drive companies may not yet be addressing. ", "Aaron\u00a0Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. I\u2019m going to sneak one last one in -- in your long-term gross margin guidance of 18% to 23%, is that inclusive of moving into new markets? Meaning as you move into new markets, we would still expect a range, that being the range going forward -- is that a fair assessment?", "Tim Leyden", "Yeah, the 18% to 23% was our historical segment mix so consequently there\u2019s margin expansion opportunity if we enter new segments that have got gross margins that are higher than our average company gross margin at the moment.

Morgan", "Thank you. Good afternoon. Two questions, if I could -- the first one is kind of a two-part, and I just want to get a sense if you can shed more light on the customer buying dynamics right now in terms of one, are you seeing more PC OEMs use boat to ship in the June quarter and can that be a wildcard as far as how it impacts September?", "And then secondly, are you seeing customers look for more bundling, i.e. trying to get more of the notebook and desktop procurement at the same time for a better price?", "John Coyne", "I think the -- to look at -- typically the consumer market has a higher level of defined SKUs in it, right? So for the retail market, manufacturers tend to build a specific configuration of product and those predefined products tend to ship ocean to minimize the freight cost. And typically those ocean shipments are timed to coincide with particular promotions in the retail channel. The more configure-to-order type business tends to get shipped air and then configured in region or shipped air preconfigured. ", "So that was the first one. The second one was -- oh, the desktop and notebook. I mean, I think certainly the large OEMs appreciate the value proposition of large suppliers with broad portfolios who have significant ongoing investment in the future of those broad portfolios in order to be able to support their businesses robustly into the future, and so I think there\u2019s -- for many years, you\u2019ve seen a progression of the large strategic OEMs putting more business towards the large vertically integrated profitable strong drive companies in order to secure their futures. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "I guess as a follow-up to that, is that helping you, John, in terms of having the luxury of being able to pick and choose your revenues here versus some of your peers, who have some distractions, if you will, in terms of -- you\u2019re able to pursue the higher margin concentration out there?", "John Coyne", "Well I think what we -- to Tim\u2019s comment earlier, I mean, what we did last quarter was to ship pretty much in line with industry mix, so from an average gigabyte shipped both in the 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch environment, we were pretty close to the industry average. And certainly that offers opportunity for mix-up should we choose to go there. You know, historically we\u2019ve tended to be mixed up a little bit from the industry average. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, and then the second question is kind of building off of Aaron\u2019s previous question regarding the longer term operating target model -- I want to get a sense with the entry into the enterprise class disk drives, just given your peer and the very significant profit pool that they do derive from this marketplace. How should we think about WD in terms of the OpEx investments required and I think typically the enterprise is a little more top heavy on fixed calls as relates to OpEx but I presume that the gross margin offset is pretty significant -- is that fair to think?", "Tim Leyden", "Yeah, I mean, we have been investing, I think John has mentioned this a number of times in the past couple  of quarters, that we have already been investing in order to enter that marketplace. There\u2019s probably some selling support that has to be added to the OpEx in order to be able to provide the type of support that those customers need. But I mean substantially, the expenditure in order to execute that business is already in the -- in our runway. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks. Good afternoon. I want to follow-up on the conversation around the unit up-side in June. It\u2019s clear that you believe those units are going into product for back to school but historically if you look at the PC and the drive shipments in the June quarter, they move much more in tandem, so I guess I want to understand what was different this year? Was it timing of some of the new netbook products that had to build volume? Was it OEMs worried about product availability if they didn\u2019t build early or something else that drove the more significant disconnect between drives and PC shipments?", "John Coyne", "Well, I think there\u2019s several considerations. First, the last three quarters have been totally atypical from a historical perspective, so it\u2019s very hard to answer a question that supposes everything should be seasonally normal. ", "Second, the inventory in the drive industry both in the OEM channels and in distribution is at an all-time low. It\u2019s running approximately half the level that existed throughout the entire year last year. We think that\u2019s having an effect and certainly we know that the PC guys also did a lot of heavy breaking in the December and March quarters and are also trying to accelerate into demand. And when you do that, they are experiencing some spot shortages in LCD panels, in memory, in hard drives, and so yes, there may be a little bit of holding of inventory within the OEMs while they match up all the things that are short. You know, it\u2019s unsafe to run everything to the most short component because as soon as you solve that, you\u2019ve got to run off and solve the next one, so people tend to set their overall objective sourced to that and as they fill in specific shortages, they match it up with components that are holding temporarily in inventory. So I think all of those things are playing together to have created some incremental demand in the June quarter. ", "The really important thing I believe from a drive industry perspective is that we\u2019ve further reduced inventory coming out of the June quarter, so in historical times, when those large surges in demand occurred, typically inventory got provisioned at a multiple of that demand. We\u2019re not doing that this time. ", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "And would you expect that that inventory levels on a secular basis have declined or are there some potential flags that the channel and you and some of your peers are looking for in the back half that would perhaps cause you to build back up inventory levels, be it demand and balance of all the different components mentioned?", "John Coyne", "I think there would have to be a very, very strong conviction that the recession was over and that a predictable, sustainable level of go-forward demand and traditional seasonality was back to have us even approach traditional levels of inventory. ", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Got it. Thanks so much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jayson\u00a0Noland with Robert W. Baird.", "Jayson\u00a0Noland - Robert W. Baird", "", "Thank you. A question on factory utilization first -- I assume with a record unit ship, utilizations were high but I guess John, can you compare the efficiencies on yield and test time to that factory utilization?", "John Coyne", "Yeah, I think the important thing to note is back in December, one of the decisions we made anticipating lower revenues, as well as lower unit volumes, was to close one of our factories in Thailand and that factory has not yet been re-commissioned. So we actually produced a record output of hard drives in a smaller factory footprint than we\u2019ve ever done before. And that was deliberate in the sense that by constraining the available factory footprint, that creates an environment in which innovation and productivity need to continue even in a soft market. And so we benefited from that in driving yields, utilization, test time, efficiency, all of those things through the last quarter by putting that constraint on our overall capacity. ", "Now, given where we now are and the progression of average gigabytes shipped that carries on quarter to quarter, we will be recommissioning that facility this current quarter. ", "Jayson\u00a0Noland - Robert W. Baird", "", "Okay, and then just one last question for me on silicon systems, maybe an integration update and I guess you\u2019d mentioned F11 from an enterprise SSD perspective but is there anything that we should expect from a progression standpoint in fiscal \u201910 on SSDs?", "John Coyne", "Well, we are going to continue to -- the integration is pretty much done in terms of transferring silicon systems as the solid state storage business unit within WD and transferring all of the financials, the business activity on to the WD systems. That\u2019s all complete. ", "We did launch a new range of solid state devices, the silicon drive 3, just a month ago and we intend to continue to grow the product line and participation in the traditional silicon systems market, which was the embedded storage market which is a complete new set of customers for us, primarily [Natcom], industrial, military, and so we will continue to prosecute that business. We will continue to roll out new products to support that business while we work on the engineering for the launch of a product into the traditional enterprise space. ", "Jayson\u00a0Noland - Robert W. Baird", "", "Sorry, just a follow-up there -- should we expect to see any relationship between qualifications in your SAS and SSD initiatives? Thank you. ", "John Coyne", "Well, I think -- yeah, it\u2019s important -- you know, we\u2019re approaching that marketplace as we enter the mainstream enterprise space, our desire was to be able to present a roadmap to our customers that gave them assurance of a commitment to that space and our ability on a long-term basis to satisfy all their needs in that space and I believe we are doing that with a family of the 10K SAS complemented by solid state for the high performance end of that space. ", "Jayson\u00a0Noland - Robert W. Baird", "", "Thanks, John. ", "John Coyne", "Well, thank you all for joining us today.

You will hear a lot more today from Sanjay and Judy.  ", " ", "Third quarter was an outstanding quarter, substantially better than we expected.  One factor has been the favorable industry conditions, which we see continuing into fourth quarter.  Other contributing factors were our focus on improved profitability, successful diversification into new sales channels and really excellent product cost reductions.  Our decision late last year to participate more aggressively in the OEM space began to pay off in third quarter.  OEM unit demand took off, and the OEM channel became our number one revenue generator.  OEM growth is diversified and global.  ", "In addition to growing our traditional embedded iNAND and bundled OEM cards, we are gaining traction in the markets for private label cards, flash components, and flash wafers.  ", "Our OEM orders for Q4 are very strong.  We believe that our high quality captive NAND output is allowing us to develop long-term relationships with top tier OEMs and given how large these OEM opportunities are, there is substantial room for us to further grow our OEM business in 2010.  ", "Concurrently, our branded retail business continues to execute well with a focus on profitability and we believe we are maintaining share in all retail geographies even after raising prices during the year.  SanDisk is uniquely advantaged with a strong retail position and a growing OEM business, both on a global basis.    ", "On the supply side, this year is different from the past few years in that no major new NAND fab capacity is ramping as we head into the fourth quarter, and therefore the inventory overhang that the industry experienced in previous first quarters should be mitigated in the first quarter of 2010.  ", "Equipment lead times for advanced semiconductor equipment such as immersion scanners are currently between six and nine months lead time, and such equipment we believe will be directed first to upgrade existing capacity to the most advanced technology nodes where the return on investment far exceeds the return on investment in new NAND fab capacity.  Given these factors, we expect NAND supply and demand to be in reasonably good balance in 2010.  ", "For ourselves, we currently expect our CapEx focus in 2010 to be weighted primarily to completing the conversion of our captive capacity to 32-nanometer technology and beyond that we expect to begin to access our non captive supply sources.    ", "In summary, our diversified OEM and retail business strategy is working well for us.  We emerge from this downturn with highly competitive technology and operations and a strong balance sheet.  We are optimistic about our prospects for the fourth quarter and for 2010.   ", "I will turn it over now to Sanjay.    ", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Thank you, Eli, and good afternoon everyone.  Third-quarter results were exceptionally strong and demand continued to strengthen throughout the quarter, with OEM being the growth driver.  Total OEM revenue grew sequentially by more than $200 million with units sold increasing by 72%.  ", "We saw significant increase in interest in both our low-capacity and higher-capacity embedded and removable flash products.  The strong OEM revenue growth was driven by two primary sources: first, significant increases in sales of removable cards and embedded flash to our existing mobile customers and, second, as Eli discussed earlier, sales of flash cards to private label customers and sales of wafers and components to new customers.  ", "Revenues from the new sales channels accounted for approximately one-third of the total sequential growth in our Q3 OEM revenues.  This broadening of our sales channels is a long-term strategy designed to expand our reach in parts of the global markets and to further diversify our revenue base.  ", "The mobile phone market continues to be the key growth driver for the company and it accounted for 38% of our total revenue during the third quarter.  With Smartphones becoming increasingly important to the growth in the overall mobile market, we are pleased with the increased design win traction for our embedded flash products in these phones as well as with increasing bundling of high-capacity cards with certain high volume phone models.  We saw strong increase in sales of 16 GB cards for the mobile market, and revenue from the iNAND product line more than doubled sequentially.  ", "Retail units grew sequentially with a strong improvement in profitability.  We recently introduced the world\u2019s highest-performance 32 gigabyte  SanDisk Extreme SDHC card  and 64 gigabyte SanDisk Extreme Pro CompactFlash memory cards demonstrating our continuing product leadership.  ", "We continue to leverage our broad product portfolio and our large scale to deepen our relationships with our most strategic retail accounts in all regions.  In fact, we recently were awarded best supplier awards from three of the largest U.S. retail customers.  ", "Expanding further on operations, I am pleased with our execution across the board.  For our total retail and OEM business, we sold 45% more units in Q3 than in the prior quarter, setting a new record for quarterly unit volume.  Our supply chain organization responded with speed and flexibility to the significant increases in customer demand that arrived in the latter half of the quarter.  ", "In addition, active management of our pricing and focus on profitable growth by OEM and retail business teams helped deliver strong revenue and gross margin improvement  for the quarter.  We continue to make excellent progress on our product cost reductions and through Q3 of this year; we are ahead of plan and we now expect to exceed 50% cost reduction for the full year.  ", "From a manufacturing production standpoint, we have been operating our fabs at full utilization rates since July and expect to maintain that going forward.  For the first time this quarter, our bit production of three and four bits per cell technologies was more than half our total fab output.  We began retail shipments of 8 gigabyte and 16 gigabyte SDHC cards and Memory Stick Pro Duo cards based on four bits per cell technology during the quarter, another industry first in the area of multi-level memory technologies.  ", "Our captive backend assembly and test facility is also functioning at full capacity and it continues to be a source of significant competitive advantage for us.    Our results for Q3 reflect the impact of favorable industry trends and the impact of proactive measures implemented by us early this year, including the restructuring of our supply base, reduced CapEx spending, streamlining of our operating expense structure, entry into new channels, supply chain improvements, and very active management of our pricing.  ", "All of these measures are paying off with the results demonstrated in both our P&L and our balance sheet.  The SanDisk team is excited about the improved fundamentals in our business and we look forward to a strong Q4 and positioning ourselves well for 2010.  ", "With that, I will turn the call over to Judy.  ", "Judy Bruner", "Thank you, Sanjay.  SanDisk delivered impressive results in the third quarter across all key measures.  We generated the highest revenue since the fourth quarter of 2007, with 14% year-over-year revenue growth, fueled by the strength of product sales which were up 18% year-over-year.  ", "As Eli and Sanjay have both commented, the OEM channel was the star this quarter, growing to 56% of our product revenue from 41% in Q2.  Retail sales were flat to the previous quarter with consumer spending still cautious and with our focus on the more profitable segments of the retail market.  ", "In U.S. retail, our USB unit sales increased more than 50% sequentially due to the back-to-school season.  Overall, worldwide retail units sold increased 5% sequentially while OEM units sold increased 72% from Q2.  Compared to our previous forecast of Q3 revenue, retail sales were as expected, and OEM sales were much stronger.  ", "We hit our stride with the new OEM channels in the second half of Q3, and we generated stronger than expected sales in the mobile handset market with significant growth of bundled cards and an even higher growth rate for our embedded mobile iNAND products.  ", "We implemented price increases for selected products in both the retail and OEM channels, and the 3% decline in our blended ASP per gigabyte was primarily due to the mix of products sold.  ", "As expected, with pricing stable, average capacities were also approximately constant.  The average capacity of products sold increased 3% in the OEM channel and declined 1% in the retail channel.    ", "License and Royalty revenue of $121 million in Q3 was very similar to the second quarter and slightly more than we had estimated. ", "Product gross margin for Q3 of 39% was much better than forecasted, and benefited from three primary factors: first, we were able to maintain higher prices than we had anticipated; second, the higher OEM sales volume in Q3 meant that we were able to recognize product cost reduction faster, essentially pulling into Q3 some of the cost reduction we had expected would take until Q4 to recognize.  Our cost reduction on a per gigabyte basis was in the high-teens in Q3; finally, the third key factor in our Q3 gross margins was that our higher sales volume meant we sold more product that carried previously taken lower of cost or market reserves, benefiting gross margins by $139 million.   ", "Excluding the benefit from inventory reserves, our underlying non-GAAP product gross margin was 22.3%, a very substantial improvement from 7.7% in the second quarter.    ", "Non-GAAP operating expense of $179 million in Q3 was within our guidance range and up $19 million from Q2 with increases in sales and marketing and G&A tied primarily to the volume of sales and profits, and increases in R&D coming primarily from technology investments.    ", "Our third quarter non-GAAP operating income was $263 million or 28% of revenue, and even if one takes out the benefit from inventory reserves, the underlying operating income was $124 million or 13% of revenue.  Our non-GAAP tax rate increased from 35% to 36% on a year-to-date basis due to the increase in profitability.  Our GAAP tax provision is $6 million, or a rate of approximately 3% for Q3, a result that stems from now expecting taxable income in the U.S. for 2009 combined with the tax valuation allowance recorded in 2008 due to the loss in that year.    ", "On the balance sheet, cash and short and long-term liquid investments increased by $246 million to nearly $2.6 billion. Cash flow from operations was a strong $238 million and we utilized $18 million for CapEx and other investments, thus generating free cash flow of $220 million for the quarter.  On a year-to-date basis we have generated positive cash flow from operations of $100 million and free cash flow of $8 million, thus returning to free cash flow ahead of our expectations.  ", "I\u2019ll now turn to forward-looking commentary.  Please note that non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation tables for all applicable guidance are posted on our website.  Before providing our guidance, I\u2019d like to point out that our fourth quarter this year will be a 14 week quarter, so there will be one extra week of revenue and expenses in Q4.    ", "We believe that the industry supply/demand balance remains in good shape and this bodes well for pricing in the fourth quarter.  Of course there will be some impact on our pricing from Black Friday and other holiday promotions.  We forecast increased retail demand for the holiday season, and our OEM backlog for the fourth quarter is higher than we have ever seen in the past.  ", "We are forecasting total revenue for Q4 between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, which includes license and royalty revenue between $100 million and $110 million.  Within the license and royalty revenue forecast for our Q4, the Samsung royalties will be based half on the old license agreement and half on the new license agreement.  ", "We expect our Q4 non-GAAP product gross margin exclusive of inventory reserves to continue to improve as we believe cost reduction will more than offset price reduction.  Compared to the Q3 underlying non-GAAP product gross margin of 22%, we expect the Q4 underlying non-GAAP product gross margin to be between 25% and 30%.  In addition we expect to sell the remainder of the inventory for which we have previously taken lower cost of market reserves, and we expect the total benefit to Q4 gross margin to be approximately $40 million.  ", "We forecast Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses to increase to $190 million to $200 million, reflecting holiday merchandising expenses, revenue and profit dependent expenses, and a 14 week quarter.  ", "We forecast non-GAAP other income for Q4 of approximately $10 million, and we expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be 36%.  The GAAP tax rate is extremely difficult to predict, but our best estimate for Q4 would be 20% and 30%.   ", "In terms of the balance sheet and cash flow, we expect our Q4 cash outflow for capital equipment and fab investments to be less than $50 million, which would bring the total cash outflow for capital spending in 2009 to something less than $475 million, compared to our original estimate for the year of $500 million.  ", "Operating cash flow in Q4 will not be as favorable as it was in Q3 since the majority of our royalty payments are received in the first and third quarters; however, we do expect positive cash flow from operations and free cash flow for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2009.  ", "I\u2019d like to end by emphasizing that the proactive measures we have taken this year, coupled with strong execution, have contributed to a significant turn-around in our results, and we believe that we will be able to further improve our profitability and cash flow in 2010.  ", "I\u2019d also like to let you know that we plan to hold an Investor Day in the first quarter of 2010, sometime after our Q4 earnings release.  ", "We\u2019ll now open the call for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We will go first to Daniel Amir with Lazard. ", "Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets", "Thanks a lot and congratulations on the good quarter. A couple of questions here -- first on the retail and OEM strategy, it seems like that the OEM has now become a bigger part of your business, which historically you\u2019ve been predominantly a retail company. How do you think that impacts in the long-term the strategy of the company and the gross margins outlook, considering that the -- that OEM does have higher gross margins than retail?", "Judy Bruner", "Let me start out with that and then turn it over to Sanjay. What I would tell you is that the gross margin that we experienced between OEM and retail are actually quite comparable. OEM sales tend to have a lower ASP per gigabyte but they also tend to have a lower cost per gigabyte, as you think about the costs associated with selling in the retail channels, such as packaging and channel costs and so on. So the gross margins are actually fairly comparable between the two channels for us. ", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "And we like the balance between retail and OEM, and as Eli pointed out in his script, it really uniquely advantages us and we want to ride the business on both fronts, and we believe we are very well-positioned to continue to do so in the future. ", "Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets", "Okay, and the follow-up question is just on your cost basis, it looks like more than 50% is now three bit or four bit. How should we look at exiting the year in both three bit and four bit and your 30X productions?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So with respect to three bit and four bit, in the fourth quarter the production of three bit, four bit -- bit production will be somewhat higher than the third quarter of 50%. All in all for the year, we will be achieving approximately 50% of three bit and four bit, and with respect to 32-nanometer, we are ramping and satisfied with the ramp. 32-nanometer in terms of total bit production will contribute approximately 10%, slightly above 10% of the fourth quarter, and most of that will be in three bit per cell technology. ", "Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets", "Okay, thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with ThinkEquity.", "Vijay Rakesh - ThinkEquity", "Just a couple of questions -- it looks like your X3 and X4 is now more than 50% of your shipments, like you said. But the margins are still kind of, you know, having [pulled a little bit], I was wondering what the contribution there is and as you have this crossover, is that the upset that you will see on the margin side, on the product margin side?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "As we have said, the benefit of three bit per cell technology over two bit per cell is in the range of 15% to 20% at product level and we certainly continue to enjoy that. The crossover with respect to 32-nanometer over 43-nanometer, we expect to achieve that in the fourth quarter and the 32-nanometer ramp together with the mix of three bit per cell will continue to give us a strong competitive position in 2010. ", "Vijay Rakesh - ThinkEquity", "Got it, and exiting Q4, where is -- how is X3, X4 [inaudible] shipments?", "Judy Bruner", "I\u2019m sorry, we couldn\u2019t hear you -- can you say that again?", "Vijay Rakesh - ThinkEquity", "Sure. Exiting Q4, where will X3 and X4 be as a percentage of shipments?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So at this point for next year, we are not providing specific guidance but we continue to focus on increasing our X3 bit max next year. Of course, it will depend on the ramp-up of 32-nanometer as well as the mix of three bit per cell within 32-nanometer. ", "Vijay Rakesh - ThinkEquity", "Got it. Okay, great. Thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Daniel Berenbaum with Ariga U.S.A. ", "Daniel Berenbaum - Ariga U.S.A.", "A couple of questions -- it looks like inventory went up in the quarter by almost $100 million and I\u2019m just sort of curious -- was that build in WIP or was there a reason for that build? Did you do that intentionally to try to get ready for a Q4 ramp? And then how should we think about inventory going forward?", "And then along those lines, was there anything in there that is limiting your revenue? I noticed that you talked about adding sales channels and it sounded to me like you are selling wafers and I\u2019m curious -- is that strategic to get rid of some inventory or are those somehow related?", "Judy Bruner", "Okay, Daniel, several questions there -- so help me if I don\u2019t answer all of them, but your first key question was to help understand why inventory dollars were up in Q3, and I would like to point out here that a key factor was the fact that we sold a lot of inventory that had been previously partially reserved, that was carrying reserves. As I mentioned on the call, gross margins saw the benefit of selling inventory that carried $139 million of reserves and if you look at the balance sheet, our inventory is up about $94 million quarter to quarter, so actually our gross inventory before reserves is down. We lowered our gross inventory but a lot of what we sold was carrying reserves, and so that is impacting the net inventory and you see the net inventory dollars up. ", "But we are very comfortable with the level of inventory that we have. We\u2019ve actually reduced it in terms of number of weeks that we are holding. It\u2019s all very high quality inventory and we believe we need it to satisfy demand. ", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "And your other part of the question was related to the new channels, so here the customers are not just wafers -- these are wafers and components, as well as third party retailers that we are cultivating [these new] channels. In fact, we have been cultivating these new channels through the course of 2009 and the results of this came to fruition in Q3, where as we said significant increases in our product sales to these new channels and to these new customers. ", "We look at this as a very strategic move by SanDisk. We look at it as a long-term move for us. For us, we are a global leader in Flash cards but there is a significant part of the market that is out there that is supplied by these third-party retailers, so we are leveraging the possibility of using our products and selling those products to them and then having them resell it, essentially it increases our sales reach, diversifies our business, and further globalizes the business. ", "And from the point of view of the customers themselves in these new channels, we really bring the value of a strong product portfolio, strong IP, technology leadership, as well as high quality production with strong delivery. So this is really we believe strategic for both us as well as our new channel customers. ", "Daniel Berenbaum - Ariga U.S.A.", "Okay, Sanjay, help me understand this on a very simplistic level -- are you -- who are you selling cards to? Are you selling components to your competitors?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We are selling components -- as I said, we are selling components, wafers, as well as Flash cards to some of these new customers and some of these new customers do include third-party retailers that compete with us in the channel. However, we look at this as SanDisk has market leadership with our brand and there is share of the market to be had by others and by providing our products to them and having them resell, we are essentially increasing the reach of our products and complementing our strong global retail brand. ", "Daniel Berenbaum - Ariga U.S.A.", "Okay, thanks. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Uche Orji with UBS.", "Uche Orji - UBS", "Let me just follow-up on the last question -- I mean, in terms of how you manage the private label, the first question is how do you make sure that -- where do you draw the line between your brand equity and selling fairly good products to private labels and people end up saying why do I need to pay for a SanDisk card when I can get this one? Because the general impression you get is that private label cards are cheaper than the branded card, so can you just help me understand how you manage that conflict?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So when sell to these new channels, the private label or wafer or components, we obviously do keep our profitability objectives in mind and so when these products are sold to these customers, we are definitely targeting increases in revenue as well as increases in the gross profits for our business. ", "Uche Orji - UBS", "Okay. I understand that. Let me ask a different question -- if I look at the mobile phone business, I think you said something like 38% is now from mobile phones. Now how much of that is -- what is the split between micro cards and the embedded? So if I can understand how that is split, that is one. ", "And then two, the impression we get is card prices are rising with NAND Flash pricing, maybe not one for one but certainly there are cost pressure now on the NAND Flash cards. Is there a risk that the handset companies will start bonding lower density cards and therefore cut down the big shipments into that segment of the market?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So I think you had a couple of questions in there -- I will take the latter one first, with respect to shipments of load capacity, we certainly with the pricing of the cards going up, we certainly see that yes there is a tendency by the handset manufacturers to be bundling lower capacity cards. In fact, that presented a strong opportunity for us with our strength on the 1-gigabyte and 2-gigabyte production, and we saw a lot of bundling of 1-gigabyte and 2-gigabyte and we were able to successfully supply to that market. ", "On the other hand, with the smartphones increasing, the high capacity cards are actually selling well as well. As I noted, we saw a significant increase in our 16-gigabyte cards in the mobile phone space. So really we are able to supply well and grow the demand both on the lower capacity cards going into bundling for even entry level phones, as well as supplying high capacity cards, which go into bundling for the smartphones. ", "Now with respect to -- and of course we are continuing to sell well in the retail channel with our mobile cards as well. ", "With respect to the mix of the business, that was the other part of your question, embedded within the mobile space [inaudible] approximately 15% of our total mobile business and this is continuing to grow and we are very pleased with the design wins and the traction that we are seeing with our NAND products here. ", "Uche Orji - UBS", "Okay, and then just one last question, Eli, in terms of how we should think about the retail market -- historically we\u2019ve all kind of looked at an elasticity model where card prices go down and demand and big shipment goes up. It kind of looks like that is not what is happening here. Card prices are going up and yet demand continues to remain strong -- let me understand if this is a change in the way you think the consumer looks at this product -- is there something that has made that model break down or should we expect that model to come back some time in 2010?", "Eli Harari ", "We think that parts of the retail market has reached, particularly the more mature part of the market, legacy imaging, for example, USB, have reached price points that are good enough -- that is, where consumers don\u2019t -- have accepted the price point, there\u2019s no pressure to bring the prices further down and we are also -- so elasticity begins to work actually in our favor in that we are able to bring our costs down but the price remains more or less stable. ", "There are also -- as you get to a price point that is very close to the price of a roll of film or a number of -- you know, a bundle of CDs, you are beginning to see really tremendous expansion of people that no longer download from the card and basically we are moving into the consumable model and that we think will drive unit demand, particularly on the low end. ", "In addition to that, I\u2019ve got to tell you that if you are here in Shanghai, there is not one trace of a recession here. I mean, this economy here is absolutely booming and there are great parts of the world where the demand for our product is very, very robust and I believe will be so through 2010. ", "Uche Orji - UBS", "That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kevin Cassiday with Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Kevin Cassiday - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Congratulations on a great quarter. I just want to understand a little more on the four bit per cell -- that\u2019s on 43-nanometer process now?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Yes, that\u2019s correct. ", "Kevin Cassiday - Thomas Weisel Partners", "And will you be transferring that to 32-nanometer or is that going to only be three bit per cell?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So next year, some of our production will ship in 43-nanometer four bit per cell and as we ramp 32-nanometer next year, our focus will be on two bit and three bit cell technology. ", "Kevin Cassiday - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay, and are there any limits to the applications that four bit can ship into?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Yes, as we have said before, the four bit per cell, it gives the benefit of lower cost but in terms of its applicability to various product platforms, it\u2019s limited. That\u2019s why we have introduced this on our standard SD high capacity cards as well as the memory stick pro dual cards. ", "The three bit per cell technology of course applies across all of our product platforms, and we expect -- we plan to continue to drive that as the workhorse technology next year. ", "Kevin Cassiday - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay, and if I could ask one more question about that -- the three bit per cell you said combined the wafer starts were 50%. Can you say what the actual revenue was?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "It\u2019s actually the production output for the year that is approximately 50%, not wafer starts but production output. And in terms of the revenue portion -- ", "Judy Bruner", "The revenue portion was a little less. We can't tell you exactly precisely but we did get strong benefit in the third quarter from cost reduction from three bit per cell and I expect that we will continue to increase that cost reduction from three bit as we move forward, including in Q4. ", "Kevin Cassiday - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay, great, thanks. ", "Eli Harari ", "I\u2019d like to add -- let me just add that the performance that we see from both X3 and X4, three and four bits per cell, is such that wherever we apply that technology, we have essentially identical performance to the two bit per cell and we do not actually identify a product as being X3 or X4 driven and the pricing is identical between X2, X3, or X4. ", "Kevin Cassiday - Thomas Weisel Partners", "I see, great. So compared to your competitors, you should have the lower cost at the same resale?", "Eli Harari ", "Yes. ", "Kevin Cassiday - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from James Covello with Goldman Sachs.", "James Covello - Goldman Sachs", "Eli, I heard what you said on the supply side relative to the issue on the lithography tools. How do you see the supply increases coming in this cycle? Is really the only issue the gaiting factor is the lead times on the immersion litho tools? Or is there still some reluctance to add capacity, given what we just came from? I mean, eventually the industry will add more supply -- how do you think that is going to happen over time?", "Eli Harari ", "There\u2019s definitely reluctance to go back to the pain that we suffered, that the industry has suffered over the last two years due to this exuberant investing in -- you know, the three years preceding this downturn. So I believe that that is totally the number one factor, the fact that I think the industry needs to see several good quarters of profitability and margins exceeding marketing, exceeding 30% or so on the products growth side. ", "And I think definitely the industry is not there yet. I think we are just beginning to see the early stages of recovery. It\u2019s looking to us very solid and very strong and very early, but overall I am very encouraged by at least the outlook for 2010, possibly 2011 and that basically comes from -- you know, there is a very, very effective cost reduction through technology transition but there is much more uncertain internal investment on new fab capacity. ", "With regard to equipment lead times, if you don\u2019t have equipment on order, you know, [inaudible] right now, you essentially are out of new wafer capacity for just about all of 2010. So even if you wanted to put several billion dollars into a new fab, the suppliers, the lenses aren\u2019t up the shelf, ready to be delivered. So I think that -- and in fact, as I\u2019ve said, the -- any new scanners out there will first be applied to upgrade existing capacity. If there\u2019s 8 million wafers total industry capacity, around 8 million wafers of NAND, 300-millimeters equivalent, I\u2019d say it would take quite a substantial investment of new scanners to just convert that 8 million wafers into 32-nanometer node and again, that equipment life competes with the DRAM guys and with the logic guys, so I think that the industry is set for a pretty stable situation in my opinion for 2010 and possibly 2011. ", "In the meantime, we see the demand continue to grow and at some point in time, of course, there will be a lot of pressure to break the mold, so to speak, and to make some major investments. But for a brand new fab, again that\u2019s an 18-month proposition. ", "James Covello - Goldman Sachs", "That\u2019s incredibly helpful. If I could just ask one follow-up on that -- how much do you keep an eye on what your competitors are doing? How much of a game of chicken is this in terms of you don\u2019t want -- very clearly from the day people make the decision to add capacity until when that comes online, we are going to have a long period here, an extended period of healthy supply/demand. But if Samsung or Hynix or Micron Intel decide to go ahead and start increasing their orders, you know, over the next couple of quarters, is that something you watch or you are just not as worried about what the competitors are doing there? Thank you. ", "Eli Harari ", "Of course we watch them very carefully and we are of course very worried about behavior that really financially, there\u2019s no return on investment. It\u2019s more a situation of [inaudible]. But of course, we can't control it and what we have to do is to control our own destiny and there our strategy is very straightforward. We have a lot of capacity, and as I\u2019ve said, our focus is to upgrade that capacity to 32-nanometer and mostly three bits per cell next year; the year after that, 24-nanometer and really move to leverage some of the non-captive supply that will be available to us where we actually -- [inaudible] actually reducing the industry supply by us not increasing it and sucking up some of that excess. ", "But it\u2019s going to be a test, in my opinion, for the industry for the main players to see how each one behaves over the next one to two years. ", "James Covello - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you so much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Coster with J.P. Morgan.", "Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan", "Thank you. Eli, I may have missed that last comment a little bit but did you say that you\u2019re unlikely to seek third party non-captive supply next year?", "Eli Harari ", "No, no, I didn\u2019t -- I said just the opposite, that before we go and rush and put -- and build the next fab, we will try to maximize existing capacity that other people have put in place that are contractually committed and available to us. ", "Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, got it. All right, and the other -- I just want to go back to the negative elasticity comment. It doesn\u2019t seem to matter anymore but it looks like the -- you don\u2019t need SSDs to kick in in 2010 for the market to grow and for supply/demand to be in balance. What is your latest thoughts regarding the adoption curve and timing of SSDs in view of the increased ASPs?", "Eli Harari ", "ASP pricing definitely is pushing out SSD adoption but that\u2019s just as well because as I said, the market is right now in good balance. If SSD were to take off anytime in the next six months, it would exacerbate the supply situation. We do believe that SSD is going to be a very important market and we do believe that in around 2011, 2012, the industry will not have sufficient supply to meet the demand from SSD that will be developed by that time. SSD is coming along, as you know, very well in enterprise. That\u2019s still a small driver of capacity, mostly SLC but we are actually quite optimistic about SSD and our role in SSD, but it\u2019s probably a 2011 type of event. ", "Paul Coster - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tristan Gerra with Robert Baird.", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird", "Just to follow-on on SSD, there seems to be an increasing gap between overall NAND Flash reliability and what the tier one PC OEMs are demanding in terms of SSD performance, so in addition to the pricing issue currently, how do you reconcile the two if you see SSD ramping a year from now in the mainstream?", "Eli Harari ", "Yes, there is an SSD gap, if you will, and there is definitely not all SSD product created equal or are equally reliable, and the OEMs are very, very good at testing, properly testing SSD devices. So the industry is in the early stages, early -- if you will, still in its infancy. You\u2019ve seen the issues that we\u2019ve had with our third generation but frankly I believe that all the major manufacturers of SSD are seeing similar birth pains. But we know what the issues are and we know what needs to be done architecturally, and NAND will be up to the task. I have no doubt about that, that on a monthly basis, we are making progress, improving our performance and our quality and reliability and so do our competitors. The operating system guys, Windows 7 is beginning to be much more Flash friendly, so I don\u2019t see that reliability or quality or endurance as being in anywhere near a show stopper for SSD. They are just kind of more birth pains, and I would expect by some time in 2010, those issues would be mostly behind the industry, including ourselves. ", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And also a quick follow-up -- you talked about 32-nanometer and 43-nanometer mix crossover this quarter for the three bit per cell. When should we expect the crossover on the [inaudible] 10 points between 32 and 43?", "Jay Iyer", "Tristan, could you clarify that question, please?", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird", "In terms of where you start having lower production costs of 32-nanometer three bit per cell relative to 43 -- does this happen at the same time in Q4 or does that take a little bit longer?", "Judy Bruner", "Let me make sure I understand your question, Tristan -- you are asking when will we have -- when will 32-nanometer three bit per cell be less costly than 43-nanometer three bit?", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird", "Right, and that relays have you seen to -- you know, the efficiency of the production as you ramp yields. ", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So as we said, that the crossover in terms of cost for 32-nanometer technology is in fourth quarter. So that means the 32-nanometer three bit per cell technology compared to 43-nanometer three bit per cell technology will become more cost-effective in fourth quarter. ", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, great. Thank you. ", "Eli Harari ", "Fourth quarter? Yeah, fourth quarter we mean this current quarter. ", "Judy Bruner", "Correct. ", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "Sanjay, just following up on the cost reduction point, can you be a little bit more specific than greater than 50% cost reduction this year? And then given the progress that you are making with three bit and four bit per cell, is there any reason why we wouldn\u2019t expect mid-40s to 50% cost reduction next year?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So with respect to cost reductions, you know, cost reduction for the year will be greater than 50%, as I said, but we are really not providing any further color at this point on that. And regarding next year, we are not providing guidance with respect to the cost reduction either at this point. ", "But of course, that will be determined by the ramp-up of 32-nanometer as well as the ongoing mix of two bit per cell, three bit per cell technologies and 32-nanometer. We\u2019ll be able to provide you more color on this in the Q1 timeframe. ", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "Okay, and then just taking a step back and thinking about the seasonality of the business, Judy, can you help us understand how you think about the inherent seasonality of the business as you think about the first quarter?", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. I really think about it -- there\u2019s two primary factors that I think about. One is that our sales generally, whether they go through retail channels or OEM channels, most of our product is ultimately destined for the consumer. And so because of that, our business is subject to the seasonal buying patterns of the consumer again, whether through retail or through OEM, so that\u2019s one factor to consider. ", "At the same time, a second factor, and Eli really touched on this today, is that the industry, the NAND Flash industry supply/demand balance is in a much difference place than we\u2019ve ever experienced before and we believe that that bodes well for industry fundamentals and pricing as we head into 2010. ", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "Okay, so just taking a step back and thinking about that, what it could mean is that pricing could be more resilient than would be typical in the first quarter but you still have to deal with the same bit growth issues fourth quarter to first quarter?", "Judy Bruner", "I think those would be reasonable takeaways. ", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "Okay. All right, thanks, Sanjay; thanks, Judy; thanks, Eli. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bob Gujavarty with Deutsche Bank.", "Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank", "I was just curious -- I mean, you\u2019ve been able to achieve some great cost reductions and I think you had a bit of a headwind in terms of the exchange rate moving against you. If that was -- just hypothetically, if that would reverse out, would that just add more tailwind to your cost reductions?", "Judy Bruner", "I\u2019ll take that -- sure, yeah, if that were to turn around, that would certainly help our cost reduction and our gross margin. I will point out, however, that in the last one to two months, the YEN has appreciated relative to the dollar and that does have some -- put some negative pressure on our cost reduction and our gross margin, primarily beginning in the 2010 timeframe because as we think about Q4, much of the inventory that we will sell in Q4 was purchased at slightly better rates, so there\u2019s been about I\u2019d say a 5% appreciation of the YEN to the dollar in the September/October timeframe. But there will be some impact on Q4 and we have taken that into account in the guidance that I gave today. ", "Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, very helpful, and just a quick kind of comment about inventories -- I understand your explanation for your inventories on your balance sheet. What\u2019s your sense in terms of what gives you comfort that there\u2019s not a lot of finished goods inventory of cards or die bank inventory of customer sites? Could you give a little bit of color on maybe how you sanity check that?", "Judy Bruner", "Sure, I mean, we track very carefully the inventory that is in the channel, in the retail channel, as well as inventory of course that we hold in hubs for some of our large customers, so we monitor that very carefully and I will tell you that channel inventory at the end of our third quarter was at about 7.5 weeks, so a very comparable level to the end of the previous quarter. ", "Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank", "Great, thanks and congratulations on a great quarter. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.", "Edwin Mok - Needham & Company", "First question is just I guess two accounting questions -- first, Judy, how much more previously written down inventory do you have that you can potentially sell as of the end of last quarter? And also I noticed receivables went up last quarter -- is that because of the different mix because you are selling more to OEM now?", "Judy Bruner", "In terms of the inventory that we are still holding that was previously reserved, I expect that we will sell really the rest of that in the fourth quarter and that that will result in a benefit to gross margin in the fourth quarter, as I said in my prepared remarks, of approximately $40 million. There can be variation on that number plus or minus depending on exactly what sells through but that would be my best estimate at this point in time. ", "And then I don\u2019t expect to have a continuing benefit from that next year because we will really have worked through it in the fourth quarter of this year. ", "With respect to receivables, I think you are asking about accounts receivable on the balance sheet, is that correct?", "Edwin Mok - Needham & Company", "Yes, that\u2019s correct -- I noticed it went up quite a bit. Is that because of mix or -- ", "Judy Bruner", "No, it\u2019s really primarily because of the volume, the increased sales in the third quarter. And -- so there\u2019s nothing unusual in the accounts receivable. ", "Edwin Mok - Needham & Company", "Okay, great. And then a question for you, Sanjay, regarding costs, can you help us in terms of comparing costs between 32-nanometer and 43-nanometer? Let\u2019s say for three bit per cell for both generational technology and let\u2019s say your RAM capacity at the same level of [inaudible] amount of production? How much cost savings do you get from converting from 43 to 32-nanometer?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So I will answer it in comparing 43-nanometer wafer levels per gigabyte costs with the 32-nanometer wafer level per gigabyte cost, assuming the same kind of technology, like three bit per cell on each of those wafers. And assuming a similar mature yields, and that comparison is -- will give 32-nanometer at the wafer level, approximately 35% cost benefit over 43-nanometer. Again, comparing apples and apples, with the assumption of mature yields. ", "So keep in mind that this is not the same as year-over-year cost reductions because year-over-year cost reductions will certainly be influenced by the ramp-up of 32-nanometer, as well as the mix in the products of two bit versus three bit. ", "Edwin Mok - Needham & Company", "Great, that was helpful. And then finally just a question regarding -- ", "Eli Harari ", "Let me just add a little bit. One of the advantages of the 32-nanometer X3 is that it allows us to put a 4-gigabyte drive, that is 32-gigabits chip into microSD, which today to get 4-gigabyte into microSD, we need two 16-gigabit chips from the 43-nanometer X3. So going from two die stacks to one die in the same form factor has significant cost reductions also on the back-end, the assembly and test and yield of that product. ", "Edwin Mok - Needham & Company", "Okay, great, yeah, that was very, very helpful. One last question regarding, I guess for you, Eli, regarding just your channel sales -- it sounds like you guys have [inaudible] a bit more component and maybe wafer even to some of your channel customers. I guess I have two questions around that -- one is do you see that as an issue long-term as you become effectively a competitor to your partner, Toshiba? Do you have a differentiating product against them, maybe because you are selling more three, four bit product versus them selling two bits? And then finally just kind of tied to that question, regarding the [inaudible] cards, are you selling to like a region that you normally don\u2019t do business or do very little business? Is that why you guys are selling to [inaudible] card customers?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So let me take that -- I just want to point out that our sales to some of these private label customers actually represent a small part of their total requirements, so that means there is definitely more opportunity for us ahead but they will continue to, of course, by from other suppliers as well. ", "And as I said before, the benefit that we bring to them is again our strong product portfolio and product positioning, as well as high quality production output. But I would also like to clarify here that what we are selling to the third party customers are our standard cards. With respect to the premium cards, such as high performance cards, those are the cards and products that we supply under the SanDisk brand only. So we believe that this is long-term strategic move by us. It\u2019s a nice growing opportunity and as I said before, provides strategic benefits to both sides and of course, as long as there is strategic benefit to both partners, we look at this as a long-term sustainable business. ", "Eli Harari ", "But let me also add on the OEM side, it\u2019s not the private label cards. The traditional OEM business, which is embedded or going into bundled opportunities with very large OEMs, these large OEMs are looking at the landscape and realizing that the market has shifted from a -- really a buyers market to a sellers market and they are looking over the next one to two years to assure themselves of high quality supply leading edge NAND, and there\u2019s not too many places that they can go to. So we\u2019ve had a relatively receptive -- actually highly receptive open arm acceptance by these large OEMs who want to bring us as another high quality source of supply. We are still a very small part of their business but they are -- you know, they see that they will need that kind of capability at least during the next period of possibly shortages. And we are taking full advantage of that to build those long-term relationships. ", "Edwin Mok - Needham & Company", "And quickly, Eli, [of all the competition with Toshiba]?", "Eli Harari ", "We compete, of course, in the market with Toshiba. Toshiba is very strong in OEM and rather weak in retail. We are very strong in retail, of course, strengthening in OEM. This is not a zero sum gain. The markets are growing and I think that we can hold our own and this is the nature of the understanding. We have tremendously good technology development and manufacturing cooperation but as far as competition, it\u2019s an open market competition. ", "Edwin Mok - Needham & Company", "Great, that\u2019s all I have, thanks. ", "Jay Iyer", "Kevin, we have time for two more quick questions. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gary Hsueh with Oppenheimer.", "Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer", "Thank you for taking my question. I\u2019ll try to make it quick. My big question here on the new OEM channels that you have established and qualified, given the fact they are mostly sell-in, does this really exacerbate or mitigate kind of the seasonal weakness that you historically have seen more on the retail side of the business in Q1? I could argue both sides but I would like to kind of see what you guys think about whether or not the OEM retail channel that you\u2019ve built up now helps or hurts seasonal weakness in Q1. ", "Judy Bruner", "Well, Gary, as I said before, most of the product that we are selling, whether it\u2019s going through an OEM customer or through a retail customer is ultimately destined for the consumer, so in that regard I don\u2019t think it changes too much the seasonal buying patterns of consumers that we are subject to. ", "I will say, however, that generally the OEM business does result in faster revenue recognition for us than the retail business does and allows us to move the inventory faster. But ultimately I think consumer buying patterns are still a factor in our business. ", "Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer", "Okay. Yeah, Judy, I just wasn\u2019t sure what to make of it because you are able to accelerate revenue recognition just suggests to me that you might see a greater vacuum in terms of seasonal weakness in Q1 but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s what you are really saying though. ", "Judy Bruner", "We\u2019re really not providing guidance for Q1 today and -- just Q4. ", "Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer", "Okay. And my second question, just to kind of make this real quick, is just there have been reports that in the September quarter, you ordered externally memory controller chips from a third party in Taiwan for 3 bit per cell -- is that at all impacting kind of your gross margins in the fourth quarter, which I assume when it\u2019s taking place in terms of shipment and revenue recognition? And is that more a testament about issues with the memory controller technology at 3 bit per cell or more a testament about not enough foundry supply for the memory chip itself?", "Eli Harari ", "I am not going to comment on any specific rumors here but as we said in the third quarter, our unit demand increased 45% and that certainly -- and a lot of that materialized within the quarter itself, so that certainly put pressure on our supply chain and our supply chain really responded very well in continuing to use our products, our memory in meeting that demand. ", "Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer", "Okay, so if it happened, it was just a momentary blip, just to kind of fulfill near-term demand?", "Eli Harari ", "You know, I\u2019m not going to comment on that. Again, those are rumors that are out there. I\u2019m not going to further elaborate on that. ", "Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer", "Okay. Appreciate it, thank you for your help. ", "Jay Iyer", "Thanks, Gary. We\u2019ll take the last question, please. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of  Daniel Berenbaum with Ariga U.S.A.", "Daniel Berenbaum - Ariga U.S.A.", "Thanks for letting me back in. Judy, I just wanted to come back to my favorite topic, which is free cash flow. So you guys obviously generated some free cash flow this quarter, you\u2019ll generate free cash flow next quarter, but with the seasonal roll-off coming into Q1, I mean, can you talk about normalized cash generation and can you talk about what kind of CapEx, both your CapEx and investments in the JV that you would need to sustain this kind of growth, and just how we should think then about free cash flow across a normal seasonal year or across a cycle?", "Judy Bruner", "Okay. You know, let me say up front I am not going to give guidance today for any specific cash flow metrics for 2010. I have said that I do expect positive cash flow from operations and free cash flow in the fourth quarter of \u201909. But clearly free cash flow remains a key objective for us and as I think about next year in terms of CapEx, we have not at this point made any commitments for new wafer capacity expansion, and if that were to remain the case, then CapEx spending would generally be at comparable levels to what you have seen this year, which is for CapEx to invest in the technology transitions which fuel our product cost reduction and for which we believe there is a very high ROI for us. ", "But so again, free cash flow is a key metric that we are focused on but we are not prepared to give 2010 guidance today. ", "Daniel Berenbaum - Ariga U.S.A.", "So you would think sort of about total investments if you maintain that, no capacity expansion, then total investments would be kind of in the $500 million range, similar to what they were in 2009?", "Judy Bruner", "With no new wafer capacity, yes, that would be a reasonable range on an annual basis for technology transitions and other related CapEx investments for the company. ", "Daniel Berenbaum - Ariga U.S.A.", "Okay, and then along those lines, assuming that demand continues to grow, in that scenario where you don\u2019t add any capacity and you have to go to your non-captive capacity, how does that affect the cost reduction roadmap? Does that slow the cost reduction roadmap or are there agreements in place where you would expect your cost reduction roadmap to remain the same?", "Judy Bruner", "Well, purchasing non-captive doesn\u2019t change the cost reduction roadmap of our captive supply base but it would of course affect the margins of the total business in terms of the mix and it is of course true that product sales based on using non-captive supply would have lower gross margins than sales using captive supply. But we clearly, as we make decisions in the future to purchase non-captive, we\u2019ll be looking carefully at the cost and ensuring that that will generate profitability for us and add incrementally to the bottom line. ", "Daniel Berenbaum - Ariga U.S.A.", "Okay, and then maybe just last question on cost is if I just look back towards the full year of 2007 when you were at $3.9 billion, kind of midpoint of your guidance gets you close to around $3.5 billion for 2009, and your OpEx as a percentage of sales is much lower than it was, even at that higher revenue level in 2007, so you guys have obviously taken a lot of costs out of the company. Are there any costs that have to come back in as revenue grows -- in other words, would you like to be spending more on advertising, more on branding, or conversely are there more costs that come back out as we move forward because of efficiencies?", "Judy Bruner", "There will be some upward pressure on OpEx as we move forward in order to support growth in the top line and the various initiatives that we are investing in on the technology front and in sales and marketing, as you described. But at the same time, we are going to try to limit that growth in OpEx until we get back to a more sustainable and good level of profits. ", "Daniel Berenbaum - Ariga U.S.A.", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Jay Iyer", "Thanks, Dan. Well, thank you all for joining us today. A webcast replay of this conference call will be posted on sandisk.com/ir shortly.  Have a good evening.", "Operator", "And again, that does conclude today\u2019s call. We do appreciate everyone\u2019s participation.

(Operator Instructions) Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair.", "Bob Blair", "I want to mention as we begin that we\u2019ll be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning industry pricing and demand, the impact of our entry into the traditional enterprise market, our immediate and long term growth opportunities, our response to customer needs and existing new markets, our expected capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization and tax rate all for fiscal 2010, our investments in product line expansion, our share repurchase plans and our financial results, expectations for the March quarter including revenue gross margin, expenses, tax rate, share count and earnings per share.", "These forward-looking statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on October 29, 2009.

For the third consecutive quarter, demand for hard drives was at the high end of expectations as the positive industry conditions that first materialized in the June quarter continued throughout the second half of the calendar year.", "The demand strength continues to be primarily consumer driven though we are now also seeing some signs of recovery in the commercial sector. We believe that overall hard drive shipments in the December quarter totaled 160 million units, up 29% on the year ago quarter and 5% sequentially.", "Industry inventory, OEM and distribution combined remains extremely  lean at approximately two weeks of sales reflecting the strong demand in the quarter, constraints in the industry supply chain particularly in media and sub strait, and continued industry discipline in managing the supply demand dynamic in those segments where supply constraints are not dominant.", "We are very pleased with WD\u2019s continued progress in pursuit of our primary objective of sustained profitable growth as we continue to respond to strength in customer demand. For the third consecutive quarter we significantly increased output in a supply constrained environment providing strong support of our customer\u2019s growth opportunities.", "Strength in overall market demand, continued customer preference for WD products, our timely investments in capital, the support of our supply partners and strong execution by the WD team generated record revenue and profits on record unit shipments.", "A moderate pricing environment combined with our passionate focus on cost and efficiency enabled gross margins well above the high end of our model range. We contained operating expenses under the low end of our model, yet we continued to grow our R&D investments by 8% sequentially.", "Asset management remained crisp resulting in record cash generation. I\u2019m particularly pleased that our management through the difficulties of the recession and our subsequent response to improving market conditions since April have increased our calendar year 2009 revenues and net income by 4% and 34% respectively, compared with calendar year 2008.", "Our compound annual growth rate over the last three calendar years which included the dampening effect of the recession was 19% for revenue, 25% for units and 29% for net income.", "We continue to realize tangible benefit from the substantial investments we\u2019ve made in technology, products, processes and capacity over the last few years with several notable product achievements in the last quarter.", "Most significant, as part of our sustained portfolio diversification and expansion strategy is our entry into the traditional enterprise market with the shipment of our 2.5 inch 10K SAS product line beginning in early November. ", "This new product family complements a range of enterprise SAS drives which we have been shipping for some years now and will allow us to both expand our business with many existing customers and add new customers in the enterprise storage arena.", "In the December quarter driven by strong customer adoption of our newest products, we led the industry in volume shipments of the market\u2019s largest capacity points in the industry\u2019s fastest growing segment; one terabyte, 750 gigabyte and 640 gigabyte 2.5 inch drives in the branded products and notebooks markets and two terabyte 3.5 inch drives in the branded and enterprise SATA sectors.", "In the branded product area, we continue to innovate. Our new WD Smartware which is now available across our refreshed My Passport and My Book external storage product lines has received very positive reviews for its highly intuitive, easy to use visual representation of the back up and synchronization process providing a highly differentiated and superior user experience.", "Further developing the theme of convenience and ease of use, we also introduce E-label display features on our premium external storage product lines. In media players, we expanded our popular WD TV range with the successful of our WD TV live product which adds network connectivity enabling home content aggregation as well as direct access to stream external content.", "Additionally this month we launched the industries first certified USB 3.0 external drive with the My Book 3.0, an industry leading, high performance solution for power users.", "Entering calendar 2010 we are very excited about the immediate and the long term growth opportunities for WD in both the consumer and commercial storage segments. Over the last nine months, despite the backdrop of a world wide recession, we have seen increasing levels of demand for high capacity, cost effective storage.", "We believe this demand is driven by the ubiquitous role of digital content in every day life and spurred in the consumer segment by increasing versatile and powerful devices and PC\u2019s with new attractive price points.", "In support of this thesis, yesterday\u2019s New York Times cited a recent study from the Kaiser Family Foundation that determined the average young American now spends practically every waking minute except for time at school using a smart phone, computer, television or other electronic device, amount to more than 7.5 hours a day. ", "This compares with less than 6.5 hours a year ago, and this does not count the hour and half that youth spend texting or the half hour they talk on their phones. And because so many of them are multi-tasking, the pack an average of nearly 11 hours of media content into that 7.5 hours.", "Meanwhile, in the commercial sector, the prospects for a recovery and corporate IT spending, the demand for green IT infrastructure solutions and a PC refresh cycle provide more optimistic indicators than a year ago at this time.", "We are addressing what we believe is a secular shift to increase usage of mass volume storage in all walks of life. To do so, we are focusing on enhancing the advantaged business model we have developed over the last several years.", "In responding to our customer\u2019s needs and earning their business in the fastest growing markets, we provide a critical combination of quality and reliability, portfolio breadth, technology and product availability underpinned by our low cost model, our vertical integration, the industry\u2019s fastest asset turns and strongest balance sheet.", "We believe this WD focus represents a sustainable advantage as we continue to respond to customer needs in our existing markets and as we move into new markets for WD such as the traditional enterprise.", "However, our enthusiasm is tempered by current macro economic uncertainties and we continually monitor the actual demand data and remain on guard against excessive optimism about the 2010 outlook. We are maintaining our flexibility and agility and are willing to apply the brakes if conditions warrant.", "Before I pass the call to Tim Leydon, I want to thank the WD team and our supply partners for outstanding execution in seizing the opportunities that emerged throughout the quarter, and our customers for providing those opportunities. Once again, we have further strengthened WD and our long term mission of generating sustained, profitable growth.", "Timothy Leydon", "Revenue for our second fiscal quarter was $26 million up 44% from the prior year and 19% sequentially. Hard drive shipments total 49.5 million units, up 39% from the prior year period and 12% sequentially.", "Non hard drive revenue including sales of WD TV, HD media sales and solid state drives totaled approximately $47 million compared to $12 million in the prior year and $36 million in the September quarter. Average hard drive selling price was approximately $52.00 per unit, up $1.00 from the year ago quarter and up $3.00 from the September quarter.", "Industry demand was strong, coming in at the high end of our anticipated range of 152 to 160 million units. Within that environment, demand for WD\u2019s products was stronger than expected. We satisfied a disproportionate share of the overall market growth which is a validation of the benefits of having a large scale vertically integrated and agile business model.", "Our low cost focus combined with a favorable product and segment mix, moderate price declines, enabled us to service that demand at margins that exceeded our business model parameters.", "Desk top demand was stronger than expected due in part to the re-emerging commercial market and growth in China. The market size was constrained by supply and pricing remained stable. We see unfulfilled demand rolling over into the third quarter.", "We shipped 21.2 million mobile drives in the December quarter compared to 13.8 million in the year ago quarter and 19.2 million in the September quarter. This above market growth was driven primarily by ability to meet customer appetite for high capacity drives at 640 gigabytes and above.", "During the December quarter, we shipped 4.1 million drives into the DVR market, flat with the year ago quarter and up from 3.1 million in the September quarter. This improvement in sequential quarterly volume was driven by improved market demand and adoption of our WD Greenpower drive platform.", "Revenue from sales of our branded products including WD TV was $569 million up 41% from $4403 million in the year ago quarter and 49% sequentially from $382 million in the September quarter.", "The increase in branded revenue is partly due to increasing demand for external storage, the refresh of our branded product line and continued consumer preference for WD products in this space.", "On the enterprise front, demand for near line storage once again exceeded expectations and our SATA product portfolio was well positioned to avail of this market expansion particularly at the high capacity points. The traditional enterprise market continues to recover. In the space, we are pleased with the acceptance of our new SAS products.", "Moving on to our sales channel and geographic results; revenue by channel was 48% OEM, 30% distribution and 22% branded products in the December quarter compared with 57%, 21% and 22% in the year ago quarter and 52%, 31`,% and 17% in the September quarter respectively.", "The geographic space of our revenue was 25%  America\u2019s, 25% Europe and 50% Asia as compared to 23%, 29% and 48% in the year ago quarter and 22%, 22% and 56% in the September quarter.", "The increases in the percentages for America\u2019s and Europe from the September quarter reflects strength in branded products and in component distribution. There was one customer, HP that comprised more that 10% of our total revenue.", "Our gross margin percentage for the quarter was 26.2% up from 15.9% in the year ago quarter and 23.3% in the September quarter. As mentioned earlier, our low cost focus, our favorable product and segment mix and moderate price declines contributed to gross margin favorability.", "Total R&D and SG&A spending was $214 million or 8.2% of revenue. This compares with $161 million or 8.8% of revenue in the year ago quarter and $195 million or 8.8% of revenue in the September quarter. Our spending reflects our confidence in the strong future opportunities for storage in an environment of expanding digital content.", "Operating income was $473 million or 85.1% of revenue. This compares with $16 million or 1% of revenue in the year ago quarter and $319 million or 14.4% of revenue in the September quarter.", "Interest and other non operating expenses were approximately $2 million. Tax expense for the December quarter was $42 million or 8.9% of pre tax income, and that\u2019s within our model range of 7% to 10%. Our cash tax rate is expected to be between 1% and 2% for the fiscal year.", "Our net income totaled $429 million or $1.85 per share. This compares with $14 million or $0.06 per share and $288 million or $1.25 per share in the year ago and September quarters respectively.", "Turning to the balance sheet, for the December quarter our cash conversion cycle was a negative three days. This consisted of 47 days of receivables outstanding, 21 days of inventory or 17 turn and 71 days of payables.", "We generated $557 million in cash flow from operation. Capital expenditures were $199 million and depreciation and amortization totaled $126 million. We also make our third quarterly debt repayment installment of $19 million thus reducing our debt balance to $444 million.", "Cash and cash equivalents increased by $379 million ending at $2.435 billion.", "The 49.5 million hard drives we shipped in the December quarter represent a new record for the company. We believe that 2010 will be a strong year for the proliferation of digital storage and continued customer preference for WD product.", "Consequently, we\u2019re increasing our capital expenditures forecast for fiscal 2010 to be between $650 million and $750 million compared with our previous projection of $650 million. ", "Depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2010 is now expected to be about $550 million as compared to our previous estimate of $540 million.", "We are ever mindful of the potential for a dip in demand that may be caused by economic circumstances beyond our control and we remain focused on supply/demand equilibrium and poised to use our flexible and agile business model to respond quickly to demand changes.", "Over the medium term, we continue to have strong growth potential in the existing markets we serve and currently unaddressed markets, given our market position and broad portfolio, willingness to invest in R&D and production assets and our strong balance sheet.  Nevertheless we are actively seeking to augment this strength by selective investments in product line expansion both internally and externally. ", "We have $466 million remaining in our stock repurchase authorization as we evaluate the merits of further repurchases against internal and external investment alternatives.", "Now I will discuss our expectations for the third quarter of our fiscal year 2010. First let me outline the market situation as we see it. We believe that continued demand for storage of digital content will drive positive growth for the storage industry as a whole despite the global macro economic conditions continuing to be challenging.", "In this robust storage demand environment, we believe that WD is well positioned within the industry to benefit from this growing market because of our agility, flexibility, product line up, technology and financial resources.", "Historically March quarter demand has been down sequentially in a range from 5% to 7%. However that true demand in the December quarter was not entirely satisfied and this coupled with an expectation of continuing strong demand for digital storage leads us to margin the market size of between 152 to 158 million units, a sequential decline of 1% to 5%.", "We anticipate that pricing will be flat to down but will be rational based on supply demand balance in all markets. Consequently, we expect revenue for WD to be in a range from $2.45 billion to $2.6 billion.", "R&D and SG&A are expected to total approximately $220 million. Our net interest expense is projected to be about $2 million. We expect our tax rate to be about 9%. We anticipate our share count to be approximately 235 million. Accordingly, we estimate earnings per share of between $1.45 and $1.55 for the March quarter.", "Operator, we are now ready to open the call to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Arun Sharma \u2013 UBS.", "Arun Sharma \u2013 UBS", "I was wondering if you could talk about the degree of corporate PC refresh and the level of Windows 7 benefits you\u2019re embedding into your outlook and has there been any change in your views in these two areas for the past few months?", "John Coyne", "I think we\u2019ve seen a modest awakening in the commercial sector and we continue to map that to be relatively modest in the current quarter and probably through mid year with a continuing uptick as we head into the back half of the year.", "Arun Sharma \u2013 UBS", "Given your outperformance on the margin side in the last two quarters are you reevaluating? How are you looking at your 18% to 23% target going forward? Are you still comfortable with that range or should we see it as fairly conservative over the next year or so and what are the puts and takes in terms of margin expansion going forward?", "Timothy Leydon", "It\u2019s at 23% margin model range and it is, we\u2019re comfortable with it the current product and segment mix. We have indicated that as we gain more traction in the traditional enterprise market that we would get to a 10% market share. It would add about 7.5% or so to the margin model.", "But it\u2019s our long term margin model. We\u2019re comfortable with it at the moment, but there is opportunity for us to be able to expand that and we are forecasting for Q3 that we will be above the top of the margin model range.", "So it is possible given behavior of competitors, the supply demand balance, the industry conditions and the segment mix to actually to above the upper end of that model range.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company.", "Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company", "First on the head procurement, obviously there\u2019s the external supply chain for heads has dwindled. You do a fair amount of internally, but of all the components that one seems to be the one where the vendors seem most unwilling to expand capacity. Are you comfortable with the external supply of heads in particular or have you compensated for that in this new CapEx numbers so that you can do more yourself?", "John Coyne", "Consistently since we acquired the internal head capability we have maintained a consistent model of roughly 80 internal 20 external and that continues to be our model. We\u2019re working closely with our external partner to share our views not only of overall market opportunity but specifically Western Digital opportunity within the market and I believe we are very well aligned together in pursuing the model that we\u2019ve consistently pursued over the last number of years since we acquired head capability and we see that continuing into the future with very solid support from our external partner.", "Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company", "In terms of the unmet demand in the December quarter, is there a way of at least ball parking just how much demand may have been left on the table? And then in that vein, the inventory numbers you talked about are extremely lean and I can\u2019t recall actually seeing that type of a number before. Do you foresee an ability to go and get to even contractual levels for hubs and such or are the OEM\u2019s okay as long as you continue to replenish as quickly as they need it?", "John Coyne", "I think you\u2019re correct that inventory levels have been extremely lean since April, since the recovery in demand surprised all of us and has continued to move along at a good clip. If you look at our estimates for demand, the 152 to 158 number that Tim just gave, that is reflecting some spillover of unfulfilled demand from the December quarter.", "If you look at total industry demonstrated capability last quarter, and I certainly don\u2019t think anybody was holding back product, then potentially we could rebuild a couple of million units into inventory through the quarter running full out which wouldn\u2019t move the needle very much off of a very lean inventory environment.", "So I expect if there\u2019s any real inventory replenishment to get things into a more traditional sustainable model, that will occur in the June quarter and that will be required to occur in the June quarter in order to support what we expect a very robust back half of the year.", "And again, I believe industry supply chain investments are lagging opportunity and will constrain total availability through the entire calendar year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steven Fox \u2013 Calyon Securities (USA).", "Steven Fox \u2013 Calyon Securities (USA)", "First of all on pricing, can you be just a little more specific? You said pricing flat to down. Were you talking about like to like or mix adjusted and is there any differences by product segments we could be aware of? And then when you look at the retail market, the rebound in external drives, how much of that would you tie into bundling of externals with PC\u2019s and how much was that just sales of externals on their own?", "Timothy Leydon", "On the flat to down pricing, it\u2019s the average pricing I\u2019m referring to. We don\u2019t give out like to like pricing. The reason that we\u2019re modeling that is because the demand is down. We\u2019re anticipating that demand be down from 160 to 158 or at least that\u2019s the high end of the range we\u2019re modeling.", "There is also, we have strength, we have the strongest competitive position in 2.5 inch and as you know in the September and December quarters, some of our competitors turned their attention towards small form factor and gaming and in the March quarter they\u2019ve come back into the market and address the more mainstream product.", "So consequently with that as a backdrop, that\u2019s why we\u2019re modeling it to be down.", "John Coyne", "Relative to strength in the external storage market, the branded product market, the vast majority of that is for independently purchase external attach as distinct from bundling with initial sales of PC\u2019s.", "Steven Fox \u2013 Calyon Securities (USA)", "Is there any other color around what drove the acceleration besides obviously better economic trending? Anything else that you would add whether it\u2019s retail promotion? I don\u2019t know what else.", "John Coyne", "The underlying them there I believe is the increasing proliferation of devices which only have capacity for transient storage and so those devices are interacting with tons of storage of content that people want to capture and store for extended periods. They\u2019re generating content. ", "If you look at the number of devices today that have high resolution cameras and high resolution video capability so the amount of content being generated by the small devices with small capacity, solid state storage on board is generating huge demand for transfer to max storage capability that the best of which is the externally attached hard drive.", "So we think that\u2019s the fundamental underlying driver. Relative to WD\u2019s success in this area, I think we\u2019ve talked before and we\u2019re continuing to focus on the ease of use, the style, the convenience of product and delivering leading capacity points to the market and I think all of these things combined with our consistent interaction with our channel partners and consistent positioning of our product line makes that a very attractive line for our partners and results in a very high level of access for consumers for the WD brand.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Robert Cihra \u2013 Caris & Company.", "Robert Cihra \u2013 Caris & Company", "I wanted to ask a couple of product questions. First within notebook you made mention of the 320 gig per platter. So on a 320 gig per platter just wondering where you are in terms of that ramp. Are qualifications done? Are you shipping volume and with the type of things that\u2019s actually meaningful as a percentage of units relative to the 250. And similarly, I\u2019m wondering is you\u2019re willing to give us any view on the SAS product, what kind of units. Are they meaningful units yet? How is that going? What kind of acceptance, that sort of thing.", "John Coyne", "Certainly our shipments of 640 gig capacity point into both the notebook marketplace and our through our branded products channel were significant and meaningful and we\u2019re by far the largest shipper of that technology and capacity point into the market.", "In relation to our SAS entry, it was planned to be modest. It is modestly ahead both in volume and mix of what we expected and has been well received but we\u2019re not breaking out units at this time.", "Robert Cihra \u2013 Caris & Company", "And when do you think you would break out units? ", "John Coyne", "When it become meaningful to the overall business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank.", "Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "I wanted to get a sense of your view of the first quarter. Your guidance for the industry is a little bit more conservative than Seagate\u2019s guidance that they gave last night. They said units would be about flat to down at about 3% in the quarter so I wanted to get a sense of why you\u2019re a bit more conservative than Seagate. And then as a follow up, in terms of the capital expansion that you\u2019re planning for this year, what kind of assumptions have you made about unit growth for 2010 and would you be comfortable with the numbers that Seagate gave last night of units growing about 17% to 20% in 2010?", "John Coyne", "Conservatism, I\u2019m not sure. I think we\u2019re really looking at what we see and interpreting the market. I can\u2019t speak for Seagate. We did our own analysis and came up with those numbers and those are the numbers we\u2019re comfortable with.", "In terms of the total growth for the market for calendar 2010, we don\u2019t have any significant difference between ourselves and Seagate for those totals. Our different view of the current quarter is within 1.5%.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan.", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "The first question is kind of loaded so I do apologize but I assume that you\u2019re pretty darn close to 100% capacity utilization and I know sometimes when you go above 95% when you\u2019re running full tilt there can be some inefficiencies. I just want to get a sense, if we don\u2019t really see any pull back in this gradual recovery that appears to be in earnest here right now, as you bring on the extra capacity, could you actually optimize your utilization and your yield to even drive greater margins than you\u2019re seeing right now or maybe you should bring down capacity utilization closer to 95%? Do you get some optimization benefits there?", "John Coyne", "Two pieces in my response to that; the first relating to utilization, once again last quarter, the opportunity provided by our customers exceeded our expectation and consequently our desire to get utilizations down into the mid 90\u2019s we didn\u2019t achieve that. We ran at higher than 95% utilization all through the quarter.", "The second part of the question is correct. When you\u2019re running at close to 100% utilization we lose some of the key value that we like to bring to customers which is the flexibility and availability equation to satisfy their needs for change. That\u2019s number one.", "Number two, when you\u2019re running very full there do tend to be some inefficiencies related to meeting the customer needs while running very full. So there is some sub optimized situations. [audio break]", "Operator", "Please continue to hold. You may resume.", "Your next question comes from [Ben Rightsez \u2013 Barclays Capital]", "[Ben Rightsez \u2013 Barclays Capital]", "The question is about the longer term. As you now when you have gross margins like this and then you still keep your long term range where it is, you run into the problem that you\u2019ve got earnings potentially next year, depending on quickly you want to get back down to target range. So I guess my question is how are you thinking about the longer term given the conditions in the short term with that predicament? Are you targeting, maybe you don\u2019t want to go into FY11 but knowing that we have the difficulty, do you think that the industry and what you\u2019re hearing into the next fiscal year supports earnings growth given what we have to model with gross margins?", "John Coyne", "Let me try to tackle that and I apologize for the dropped line. I\u2019m not sure what happened. We are looking at the industry as I mentioned, we\u2019re looking at we think a fundamental change in the demand for storage and an increase in that demand. And to some extend, the delinking of that demand from the underlying GDP growth rates or at least a multiplication of demand relative to GDP growth rates. So that\u2019s a very, very positive thing.", "We believe that our drive technology is going to offer the most compelling solution for those increasing storage demands going forward for the foreseeable future. We believe you\u2019ve seen in our performance and Seagate\u2019s performance in the past quarter, I think you\u2019re beginning to see the power of the large scale, vertically integrated companies when executing effectively and the consequent ability to continue to invest substantially in the technology to drive future solutions to that storage demand.", "So I think all of those things point towards a very positive environment. We\u2019re not yet at the point where we\u2019re altering our model, but I believe the vectors for storage needs, the consolidation in the industry, the consolidation in the supply chain, I think are all pointing towards an ability to up that model in the future.", "[Ben Rightsez \u2013 Barclays Capital]", "With regard to the enterprise in terms of, you mentioned it\u2019s not big enough to break out yet, your SAS product and you\u2019re happy with it. What do you see as your pace of new product introductions? What should we expect? And what should we also expect on the FSD side in that vein?", "John Coyne", "Clearly a single product is not going to support the needs of our customers in the traditional enterprise space and we have a developed road map which we have discussed with customers and which we believe addresses a significant amount of their needs. I think on the previous call I indicated our expectation that within three years the enterprise, traditional enterprise space would be serviced over 90% by 2.5 inch 10K and that our solution for higher performance than that would be addressed with solid state.", "I also indicated we expect to have an enterprise ready solid state product line offering in 2011 and so we\u2019ll continue to expand the current drive base 2.5 inch 10K SAS, continue to expand that product line over the course of this year and follow up with an extension to the product line with higher performance products in 2011.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan.", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "I was wondering first if you could maybe help us in terms of understanding the second part of the answer you were providing to my question earlier in terms of when can you restore that flexibility to address your customer needs and maybe reallocate to optimize the business proposition. And then the follow up I wanted to ask earlier was just if you could talk a little more about the structural change we could be seeing in terms of desk top resurgence and the emerging markets. Do you see more of the power of computers coming back and is it something that can stick around for more than just a few quarters?", "John Coyne", "I\u2019m not sure exactly where we dropped you and I apologize for that. What our objective is, is to get back to the low to mid 90\u2019s in terms of utilization so that we have ongoing day to day flexibility to move with the market. I don\u2019t see accomplishing that in the current quarter. I\u2019m hoping we\u2019ll be able to achieve that in the June quarter, so that\u2019s about the timing.", "And that\u2019s driven just by our ability to bring in and commission and install and qualify the capital to accomplish that from an overall capacity perspective. ", "In relation to desktop, I think that the primary driver there, there\u2019s a healthy resurgence in desktop commercial desktop demand. That continues to be a price sensitive business and the difference between replacing a desktop system which potentially can reuse a lot of accessories and so on versus going to mobile, combine that with CIO concerns about security and mobility of data and so on, I think there\u2019s good life ahead of us in the desktop PC arena.", "On the consumer side of the desktop, it\u2019s really the high end machines there that offer the geeks and freaks ability to configure systems out as they desire with very high performance, high capacity solutions. And then of course the 3.5 inch drives going into external solutions where increasingly we\u2019re seeing adoption of home network systems; things like the WD World edition and WD Sharespace which provide whole home solutions for multiple network computers that are very simple to operate.", "These also have a healthy appetite for very high capacity 3.5 inch drives. So I think they\u2019re the fundamental drivers of demand there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kevin Hunt \u2013 Hapoalim Securities.", "Kevin Hunt \u2013 Hapoalim Securities", "I had a question on the R&D. It\u2019s been ramping up over the last quarter or two and based on the guidance you gave it looks like it will continue so I wanted to understand is that something you expect will continue to ramp up going forward and maybe you could help us understand what sort of target that is?", "John Coyne", " I think the R&D spending with ramp. The percentage as a percent of revenue will be relatively static. You can see our total OpEx actually is down. Our range is 9% to 10%. We\u2019re down at 8.2%. ", "If we continue, which I certainly hope we can, to grow revenue at a similar pace on a long term basis that we\u2019ve achieved over the past number of years, then you can anticipate that our dollar spending in R&D will continue to increase.", "And back to my earlier comment about the ability of the large scale fully integrated companies to invest in the future of this technology, those investments are not trivial. They are over the next three to five years some very significant technical hurdles to be over come, new technologies to be introduced and we are currently spending heavily in those areas to ensure that our current ability to delivery industry leading capacities, ramp them into stable higher reliability products, that ability to lead the industry is maintained as we move through the significant technology changes in the future.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Bailey \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "David Bailey \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Since the December quarter you\u2019ve seen a steady shift in your business towards distributors and away from the OEM\u2019s. Can you talk about the strategy behind this and the impact that it\u2019s had on ASP\u2019s?", "John Coyne", "I have to re-characterize that a little. There has been no shift away from OEM\u2019s. In fact we\u2019ve increase our OEM business and we continue to provide very strong support of our OEM opportunities for growth. ", "We are also mindful of the opportunities in distribution and in branded and we\u2019re continuing to apply resource and product allocation to those areas also. So we\u2019re growing all across the board. If you look at the numbers for last quarter, the market grew by eight million units. We grew by 5.4 million units and a piece of those 5.4 million units went to each of the markets that we serve.", "David Bailey \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Your head count has come up a decent amount since June. I think it\u2019s around 9,000. How should we expect this to trend going forward and where have you been allocating the resources?", "John Coyne", "Head count primarily the head count increases are related to production personnel in our Asia facilities, heads, media and drives. If you run the numbers back over the last couple of years you\u2019ll see that our productivity continues to improve as we ramp. But as we ramp substantial volumes we will also substantial people.", "We have increased our technical head count also and our professional head count and in those areas we\u2019re now back at levels that are higher than pre recession levels. The good news about that process where we reduced some head count across the board last December through March has allowed us to rebuild with more current and future oriented skill sets and we have a significantly stronger professional and technical employee base today than we had a year ago.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kaushik Roy \u2013 Wedbush Securities.", "Kaushik Roy \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "2010 seems like it\u2019s going to be a good year. What could go wrong? Let\u2019s say when all the capacity comes on line for two or three quarters, what\u2019s your sense for calendar \u201910?", "John Coyne", "We believe that the underlying digital content creation, the underlying life style changes and dependencies on the internet and the delivery and consumption of content, we believe these are very strong secular moves that are offering a growth path that is layered on top of the modest recovery that we\u2019re seeing in worldwide economic activity today.", "Frankly we think the worldwide economic recovery is a lot more fragile that the growth in demand for digital content distribution and storage of all kinds. So what could go wrong would be I think the primary concern would be a macro economic event, a macro economic deterioration and where we\u2019re watching actual demand very closely and events in the world around us to track that and what we can do in that environment if it were to occur would be similar to what we did when it occurred last year.", "On the other front, I think concerns that seem to swirl around about capacity investments being made in the industry are way over blown. If you look at our capital investment behavior over the past several years and recognize that the activities in which we\u2019re investing haven\u2019t significantly changed.", "If you go back to 2003 we were a pure play drive assembly company with very low CapEx requirements. We added heads which engendered a significant increase in CapEx requirements. We then added media in 2007 which adds a further level of CapEx requirement. But in all cases, we have been very close coupled in terms of our investment decisions relative to, all made on a back off the day we think they\u2019re needed by the lead time of the equipment.", "We work very hard with our capital equipment supply base to limit those lead times and continually shorten those lead times. So we\u2019re very focused on just in time investment to support what we believe is real demand. ", "We\u2019ve also shown in the last year, a willingness and ability to tune our utilization of the assets that we have in invested in to the actual market requirements, and we\u2019ve demonstrated that doing that, that behavior generates far more reward for us than any other behavior. I think most of our colleagues in the industry similar learning and similar behavior.", "So I\u2019m very positive about the industry\u2019s ability to see what\u2019s going on in terms of real demand and take appropriate actions to match supply to that demand. ", "The biggest concern I have right now is that the level of investment being put into capital by the extended supply chain is inadequate to support the opportunities that we believe are there through the end of the calendar year.", "Kaushik Roy \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Going to the gross margin question, do you think December was the peak gross margin or you could possible see better margins sometime during this calendar year?", "John Coyne", "We always seek to improve.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Looking at the gross margin for this current quarter, taking the mid point of your guidance it appears that it looks like it\u2019s assuming somewhere around a 25% or so gross margin. Is that the way to think about it? Are you conservatively guiding for that or why would we see some type of contraction if so?", "Timothy Leydon", "I think it\u2019s closer to 24% on the midpoint and we\u2019re guiding to that because we believe that as I\u2019ve indicated previously, we talked about the market size. We indicated that we think it will be in the 152 to 158 million range. We also have got strength in 2.5 inch. We\u2019ve got the strongest position there, the strongest market position and that\u2019s got the most competition.", "As well, we\u2019re servicing gaming and small form factor turn their attention to servicing that market in the March time frame after the Christmas rush. So consequently those are the reason why we\u2019re looking at the decline in margin. And it\u2019s pretty similar to the decline that we heard yesterday from Seagate.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "With that said, relative to that it sounds like the potential upside would be more or less just driven by volume or it seems like everything else is remaining fairly stable through the quarter so is that a fair assumption?", "Timothy Leydon", "We seek to optimize everywhere we can improving costs, improving mix, taking advantage of the market demand and assuming inventory stays in balance and the rest of the folks in the industry are rational.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "I know it\u2019s a small revenue contribution but it is growing here over the last couple of quarters, your non hard drive business, and I would assume that\u2019s a lot of the industrial, military stuff, how should we think about that from a model perspective here as we move forward because if we take what we\u2019ve seen, if that starts to become somewhat meaningful here as we move out over the next 12 to 18 months.", "John Coyne", "I expect it will. You\u2019ll observe from the numbers that the combination of media players and solid state drives taken together are the fastest growing component of our business and they\u2019re both growing and we anticipate they will both continue to grow.", "Again, I think we\u2019ll break them out somewhat more as they become individually larger and significant to the overall business results. I\u2019m not quite sure when that will be. The sooner the better as far as I\u2019m concerned.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Is it fair to assume that that carries a much better gross margin structure relative to the high end of your 18 to 23?", "John Coyne", "What we\u2019ve given before from a stratification view point on gross margin we\u2019ve got the engineering products which is enterprise and SSD has the highest margin. The next tier margin comes from the consumer type products which is DDR, branded and WD TV and the lower tier is the OEM heavy products which is desktop and notebook.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kathryn Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "Kathryn Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Earlier this week EMC refreshed its mid range storage systems with SATA only drive. Is that indicative of end user demand for cheaper and lower power consumption storage this year?", "John Coyne", "Yes, we believe it is and some two years ago now we introduced the WD Greenpower drive technology to the market and we\u2019re seeing increasing adoption of that technology both in external storage, in DVR\u2019s in notebooks, in desktops and in the enterprise SATA environment. We think that technology provides a significant value where we\u2019re seeing customers acknowledge that.", "Certainly there\u2019s a lot of work going on in the enterprise environment that is developing the management tools to come up with more effective tiered storage solutions that are using I think the system that EMC announced last week if I\u2019m not mistaken, had an SSD layer and high capacity ATA for the bulk storage providing a complete high performance, high capacity storage system. We believe that\u2019s a significant trend as we look out into the future and we\u2019re aiming to have products to support that trend.", "Kathryn Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "You talked about bringing channel inventory up a little bit between now and June but what would you expect to do with your own inventory levels between now and June as you prepare to serve the seasonal demand in the back half of the year?", "John Coyne", "Assuming seasonality in the June quarter likely we would seek to level load our capital investment by increasing inventory exiting the June quarter to support what is typically a significant ramp requirement at the end of the September quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jayson Nolan \u2013 Robert W. Baird.", "Jayson Nolan \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "The trajectory of CapEx is declining a little bit into the second half of the fiscal year, maybe some thoughts there and is it in part a function of just external supply is not keeping pace?", "Timothy Leydon", "I\u2019m not so sure. It\u2019s only minor. We expect $176 million and $200 million so that\u2019s $376 million. So it\u2019s effectively exactly 50% of the upper part of our range of our $650 million to $750 million range.", "Jayson Nolan \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Is there a reason why there wouldn\u2019t be upward pressure to it in the second half?", "Timothy Leydon", "We started off originally with our CapEx forecast at the beginning of the year we had $600 million and at that stage we were actually front end loading that $600 million in order to deal with the strong demand that we foresaw in the September and December quarters and as we have seen the unexpectedly strong demand from then on, we\u2019ve been turning to add capacity on a just in time basis and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re aiming to do.", "So we would like if we really had our choice we would really like to book capacity in the weaker quarters in order to be ready for the stronger quarters, but we try to do things on a just in time basis because we\u2019re trying to respond to customer needs.", "So I think our capital position is adequate to address what we see as the strong demand. If it comes out stronger we\u2019ll make provisions to increase it if necessary.", "Jayson Nolan \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "If you could just talk to use of cash in general as it builds up here on your balance sheet.", "Timothy Leydon", "We kept our cash during the downturn mainly because at the time, lots of things have been forgotten now, but at the time we were wondering whether we had enough cash and with the macro economic situation being the way it was. We still remain cautious but we\u2019re using it for operational and strategic purposes as opposed to using it for capital restructuring or whatever.", "Our goal is to find and extend product lines and to spend money operationally because we believe that in the long them that that provides the best value and the best return for our shareholders.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Douglas Reid \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Douglas Reid \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "I wondered if you could break out CapEx into a maintenance level for given output and incremental. Just looking over the past year over long range to be able to see that difference in what is maintenance level versus growth.", "Timothy Leydon", "From a CapEx viewpoint our model is to stay within 7% to 8% of revenue and in the past when we were not vertically integrated we had a lesser percentage. Then as we added heads and more lately media, it went from about 6.5% prior to media up to 7% to 8% that we have right now.", "When we look at the capital you have to look at over a long term. If you look at it in shorter terms it can appear lumpy but over the longer term, we\u2019ve pretty much been almost three way between heads, media and assembly and test, pretty much split evenly. We don\u2019t have a number to tell you about the replenishment number.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Murray.", "Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Murray", "", "I guess a philosophical question, is there anything taking the capacity down to the low to mid 90\u2019s, that\u2019s still a pretty healthy level, the if you take the capacity down there is there anything on the pricing side that says that pricing as a rule would decline at more typical levels again. And then if that\u2019s the case could there also be an argument to be made to say maybe it\u2019s healthier to keep it at mid 90\u2019s to high 90\u2019s if we can keep pricing a little bit more stable.", "John Coyne", "Actually it\u2019s to the contrary. By operating at 93% to 95% on a planned basis against our anticipation of overall demand volume it allows us the flexibility to respond to opportunity to go after mix opportunities that are outside the scope of our pre-planned production.", "Traditionally, WD has done very well in building customer satisfaction on the one hand which tends to be sticky and on the other hand building profitability by jumping into opportunities presented by missteps by competition or by changed market conditions that are recognized late and where customers are seeking to respond quickly to that.", "So having that flexibility to respond in short order to upside opportunities or to mix changes is actually a benefit when it comes to overall financial performance.", "Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Murray", "Is there any way to at least order of magnitude separate out how much of the gross margin upside to the sort of normalized model range is due to the high capacity utilization levels versus mix versus what\u2019s been pretty stable pricing on like for like.", "John Coyne", "On the gross margin, we know those numbers. We actually have if we look at it for last quarter from a ranking viewpoint, cost improvement was number one. Mix was number two. Utilization was number three and then we had benign pricing percentage.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Robert Walker \u2013 FTN Equity Capital Markets.", "Robert Walker \u2013 FTN Equity Capital Markets", "You mentioned the industry supply chain investments, you\u2019ve seen those lagging the opportunity you see which is a constrained demand for the whole year. Do you think OEM\u2019s might order in calendar Q2 in anticipation of a third quarter, fourth quarter demand?", "John Coyne", "That\u2019s a possibility that there will be some modest activity of that kind. Certainly our discussions with our large OEM customers are much more focused on availability and our commitment to support their plans through the back half of the year so that potential would be part of those discussions", "Robert Walker \u2013 FTN Equity Capital Markets", "Last night Seagate mentioned a 170 to 180 range for a quarter would be difficult for the industry to hit. Do you see that as well and I guess when do you see capacity finally kind of catching up with demand? Is that not until early 2011?", "John Coyne", "I think yes to both. That\u2019s my concern about industry supply chain investments, that the timeline relative to those investments even if made today, it\u2019s going to be a push to get significant output from those investments in the back half of 2010. So I believe we\u2019re going to run constrained all the way through the back half of the year and into \u201911.", "Thank you all for joining us today.

Joining us on the call today are Dr. Eli Harari, Chairman and CEO of SanDisk; Sanjay Mehrotra, President and COO; and Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President of Administration and CFO.", "Before we begin, please note that any non-GAAP financial measures discussed during this call, as defined by the SEC in Regulation G, will be reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. That reconciliation is now available along with supplemental schedules on our web site at sandisk.com/IR.", "In addition, during our call today we will make forward-looking statements.

Q4 was our best ever quarter for product revenue, margins and cash flow reflecting a dramatic reversal in our results when compare today the fourth quarter a year ago. Pricing held up well, throughout the fourth quarter and product margins benefited from a 20%, sequential reduction in cost per gigabyte. A year ago the fourth quarter of 2008 marked bottom of the industry down cycle, with all flash memory manufacturers operating at negative margins and reporting heavy losses.", "By the fourth quarter of 2009, all NAND suppliers including ourselves were reporting vastly improved results, partly resulting from production cut backs in the first half of 2009. Despite the recession, global demand for NAND flash continued to grow, and by the second half of 2009, flash manufacturers returned to 100% capacity utilization.", "This turnaround happened considerably more rapidly than expected, demonstrating the remarkable ability of this young industry to self correct. This is an important factor that we have discussed with you in the past. While we benefited significantly as did others from the general improvement in the market conditions, that is rising tide, lift in the both. I do believe that our decisive actions SanDisk contributed much more so to our rapid turnaround amidst the ongoing industry while recovering. I would like to reflect on the more important of these SanDisk actions.", "In the fourth quarter of '08, we structured the company to stream line our organization along retail and OEM business, which allowed us to reduce our non-GAAP operating expenses by 25% in 2009 compared to 2008. We opened major new OEM sales channels, and we set our number one priority to return to profitability as evident in our Q3 and Q4 results.", "The Q1 '09 we sold approximately 20% of our captive capacity Toshiba and we further cut our captive by throttling the capacity utilization rate and our finishing fabs by more than 20% in the first half of 2009. At the same time, throughout 2009, we sustained our investment advance NAND flash and 3D read/write, 3-bits-per-sale and 4-bits-per-sale NAND architecture, advanced proprietary controller chips, and new products for both our retail and OEM businesses. And in Q2 '09 we renewed patent cross license agreement, with Samsung electronics.", "Looking forward now, with have no new NAND fab expected to come on stream in 2010. We expect the NAND industry to continue to experience a healthy balance between demand and supply. Flash storage in mobile handsets is expected to continue to be the primary demand growth engine for the industry in 2010. Exciting new devices such as the iPad launched yesterday are demonstrating the significant new opportunities ahead for flash mass storage.", "We see a similar trend in digital camcorders which have abandoned optical recording media and have largely embraced flash memory. Today Verizon announced its launch of our slotRadio card in 2000 Verizon stores for use with their high end cell phones, and Solid State Drive SSD are making well publicized in-roads in enterprise storage, and we believe it is only a matter of time before the tipping point is reached for the broader adoption of flash SSD in Notebooks and Netbook PC.", "The iPad as well as Kindle are already passed their tipping points, as these class of devices are very safe and are required to deliver long operating on a battery charge, therefore doing away all together with rotating disk drives or DVD players and relying exclusively on NAND flash for mass storage.", "Turning to capacity current industry forecast project a 2010 total NAND industry bit growth in the range of 70% to 90%. For SanDisk we currently project our captive that offered to increase our 2010 by up to 70% compared to output in 2009, approximately in line with our currently project bit demand growth in 2010 businesses. Our bit output increase will come primarily from completion of the technology transition to 32 nanometer by late 2010, as well as modest incremental wafer capacity, utilizing the unused cleaning space in the Yokkaichi Fab 4.", "We believe this capacity at Fab 4 will be extremely cost effective and we plan to exercise our option to invest and take up to 50% of that capacity. Therefore the timing and pace for this final increment of Fab 4 capacity we will proceed with caution to allow in capacity additions with demand from our customers. Frankly we expect this to add approximately 10% to our monthly captive wafer production in the second half of 2010, the rest coming in 2011. This is all factored into the 2010 bit growth guidance that I have just provided you. This does mean that our usage of flash memory for NAND captive sources will likely be minimal in 2010.", "Flash industry pricing is expected to reflect a healthy balance between demand and supply in 2010. In the next several years, industry wise NAND cost reduction are expected to decelerate from the pace of the prior five years due to increasingly more challenging scaling of future NAND technology node that we have discussed on previous occasions.", "We estimate our own cost reduction in 2010 will be in the 30% 40% compared to 50% in 2009, when we captured the cost benefits of 3-bits-per-cell technology. We expect to start transitioning to 24 nanometer node late in 2010, with cost benefits expected in 2011. Looking to the future, into 2010 with a superb captive manufacturing base, weight technology and products and a lean and focused team that is driving our global opportunities.", "Our strategic options in 2009 and our uniquely balanced participation in both OEM and retail global markets is working very well for us, and will guide our business activity in 2010. I will now turn it over to Sanjay.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Thank you, Eli. Good afternoon, everyone. The strong performance in our fourth quarter was driven by healthy demands for our product, from both our retail and OEM customers, leading to record unit sales. We experienced strong lift in seasonal consumer demands, and we also benefited from our channeled diversification efforts, and our strategy to achieve a balanced retail and OEM business focus. Our operational execution was solid, with our wafer fab production remaining at high efficiency and the supply chain executing well to meet rising demand level.", "Following the record third quarter in product sales, channel inventory levels remain healthy and we exited 2009, maintaining our focus on profitable growth, augmented by continued tight control, on costs and expenses. We are exceptionally well positioned now in mobile storage. Five of our top ten customers in Q4 '09 were tier-1 handset manufactures and in addition, we are working closely with the leading mobile network operators, and mobile retailers. Face of our mobile cards and embedded flash products drove nearly half of the fourth quarter's record total product revenue. Overall in Q4 we sold 82 million mobile products. ", "Our embedded flash product sales grew very strongly and that accounted for more than 20% of our total mobile OEM business. Designs and momentum for the iNAND continues to be strong. Finally, within OEMs revenues from the new channels and customers that we discuss with you in the third quarter grew with strong revenue and profit contribution.", "Shifting to our retail business, the fourth quarter was seasonally strong. The retail sales, within all of our end market posting sequential revenue growth. Our retail market share remains strong in the major geographies and our retail business is growing particularly well in the APAC region.", "In regard to the new products and markets, there is tremendous amount of innovations and energy, and we will share some of this with you at our investor day meeting on February 26th.", "In 2009, the combination of a strong brand of 3-bits-per-cell technology, along with seamless process technology migration enables SanDisk to reduce product costs per gigabyte by more than 50% for the fifth consecutive year. Furthermore, our the supply sales scales at efficiently throughout the year, it means a 26% increase in unit volume demands compared to the prior year level. Our Shanghai assembly and test facility significantly ramped upward, with strong productivity gains. This in combination with capacity RAM and our contract manufacturers, allowed us to flexible meet the feasibly strong demand in a cost effective fashion.", "In Q4, we continue to ramp our 32-nanometer process technology and as accounted for slightly more than 10% of our total bit output. We began shipments of MicroSD, SD and Memory Stick Pro Duo card, using our 32-nanometer 3-bits-per-cell technology as planned. ", "To summarize, we are pleased with our Q4 and 2009 result, and we look forward to delivering more in 2010. With that, I will turn the call over to Judy.", "Judy Bruner", "Thank you, Sanjay. Our fourth quarter results reflected strong growth in both OEM and retail channels. With retail revenue up 41%, and OEM revenue up 40% sequentially. OEM represented 56% of our fourth quarter product revenue, the same proportion as in the third quarter, and for the year, our product revenue was equally balanced at a 50/50 mix of retail and OEM.", "Our fourth quarter retail revenue was down 6% year-over-year with the decline due primarily to increasing amounts of our mobile business, going through mobile network operators stores that we now count as OEM. Our fourth quarter OEM revenue was up 215% year-over-year, with the mix from the mobile market increasing to more than 80% of our OEM revenue. Our total fourth quarter product revenue grew 54%, year-over-year, with units up 55%, ASP per gigabyte down 23%, and average capacity up 29%. On a sequential basis, our ASP per gigabyte declined 2%, and our total average capacity was up 18% driven primarily by the OEM mobile product mix.", "License and royalty revenue of 100 million in the fourth quarter included Samsung royalties based half on the old license agreements and half on the new license agreements. Q4 product gross margin of 44% on a GAAP basis and a 45% on non-GAAP basis was higher than we had anticipated, due to less price decline and stronger cost reductions which was 20% per gigabyte. In addition, we received a higher than expected benefit of 95 million from selling products which carried previously taken reserves. The reserve benefit came primarily from lower of cost or market reserves taken on inventory builds in 2008, but also reflected the sale of inventory that had been reserved as excess or obsolete. Without these inventory reserve benefits, our underlying product gross margin was 36%, a level that generates strong profitability on our product business and a very good return on invested capital.", "Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses of 192 million were in the range we expected and reflected a seasonal lift in sales and marketing, a 14 week quarter, and an increase in the accrual of incentive compensation related to our 2009 performance. Comparing the full year of 2009 to 2008, we decreased our non-GAAP expenses by 25%. Our fourth quarter and non-GAAP operating income, was 417 million or 34% of revenue. With half the benefit received from inventory reserves, the underlying operating income was 322 million or 26% of revenue, with more than 70% of this operating profit coming from our product business.", "Our non-GAAP other income increased sequentially by 5 million due to certain one-time investment gains exam to a lesser extent due to higher invested cash balances. On the balance sheet, cash and short and long-term liquid investments increased sequentially by 432 million to $3.0 billion. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was the highest ever in a single quarter at $388 million, and free cash flow was even higher at $431 million.", "Cash flow from investing included a $57 million receipt of excess cash from the flash partner's joint venture, zero outgoing capital payments to the joint venture and a modest outflow for property and equipment. For the full year, we generated cash flow from operations of 488 million and free cash flow of 438 million. For 2009, net cash used for capital related investing was only $49 million. Key elements included 378 million outflow for the capital investments in the joint ventures and 60 million outflow for property and equipment. With these outflows largely offset by the receipt of 277 million from the joint venture restructuring, a 110 million of cash returned from flash partners, and 13 million received from the wind down of flash vision.", "We ended 2010 with $1.07 billion of equipment lease obligations, down from 2.1 billion at the end of 2008. Our inventory ended 2009, at 596 million, almost the same number as at the end of 2008. However, both the gross level of inventory and the offsetting reserves have been significantly reduced and reserves have returned to normal levels.", "I will now turn to forward-looking commentary, I'll provide guidance for Q1, as well as for the full year 2010. Please note that non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation tables for all applicable guidance are posted on our Web site. We are expecting a normal level of seasonally reduced demand in the first quarter. Coupled with the impact of Q1 being a regular 13 week quarter, compared to our 14 week Q4. We are forecasting total revenue for Q1 between 875 million, and 950 million which includes license and royalty revenue between $80 million and $90 million. Fully reflecting the new Samsung license agreement. For the full year 2010, we forecast total revenue between 4.0 million and 4.4 billion, including license and royalty revenue between 320 million and 360 million. ", "Turning to gross margin, we expect that first quarter cost decline may be a bit less than price decline as we expect more modest costs decline in Q1 than we generated in the previous two consecutive quarters of very strong cost reductions. For the full year 2010 we expect that the annual cost decline which Eli estimated at 30% to 40% will be greater than the annual price decline allowing product gross margin to expand from our 2009 underlying product gross margins which is on the teens on a full year basis.", "We are forecasting a non-GAAP product gross margin for Q1 and for the full year of approximately 31%, plus or minus 3 percentage points. We forecast non-GAAP operating expenses in Q1 of 175 million to 185 million, and for 2010, of 725 million to 750 million. We forecast non-GAAP other income for 2010 to be approximately $40 million spread relatively evenly across the year. We forecast a non-GAAP tax-rate of approximately 37%, up from 36% in 2009, based primarily on certain tax law changes for 2010.", "On a GAAP basis, we are still in evaluation allowance position, and as such, the GAAP tax-rate is too difficult to predict. Turning to the balance sheet, and cash flow, we expect our total capital investment in 2010 to be between $700 million $900 million, covering fab technology transitions, incremental wafer capacity and Fab 4 as Eli described and back-end supply chain and other CapEx requirements across the business. We expect fund this primarily from a combination of cash flow from operations, and working capital from the joint ventures, and we expect continuing positive free cash flow in 2010.", "As in the past, we will provide further color on CapEx and our funding plans at our investor day on February 26th. In summary, we are expecting solid performance in 2010, and we look forward to sharing more information with you at our upcoming investor day. We will now open the call for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. If you would like to ask a question today, (Operator Instructions). We'll pause one moment as we assemble our roster. And our first question today will come from Daniel Amir, Lazard Capital Markets. ", "Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets ", "", "Congratulation on a great quarter. A couple of questions here. First of all on the price decline, you assume that price declines will be less than your cost down, which is 30% to 40%. Which means that pricing you're assuming pricing will be similar like '09 I guess in the 20 in the mid to high 20s, maybe. Can you a bit explain kind of your assumptions there, why you think the market is going to behave similar like '09 considering that, you know, there is some new capacity coming on board, and the expansion of Fab 4, and some shrink age in the market as well? ", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "This is Sanjay. When we look at the bit supply growth in 2009 for the industry it was about 40% and as Eli pointed when we are looking at 2010, the supply growth is expected to be 70% to 90% and ours is on the low end of that, up to 70%. When you look at the demand drivers, the demand drivers are strong, you know, when you see the handsets, the smart phone, higher capacity units are continuing to sale both on the embedded side as well as on the card side and new applications that are coming out are continuing to drive a new demand for flash storage as well, and on top of all of this the demand is being driven globally I mean from Asia PAC we saw very strong growth in demand on a year-over-year basis and we are continuing to see that from China, India and the emerging market so all of these factors the application, the demand growth drivers particularly the mobile SSD continuing to increase its penetration during the year. The market as well as the regions we believe will continue to drive the demands and looking at the best supply growth we think that the demand will be in good balance during the course of the year and their cost reductions will be in the 30%-40% range and pricing will hold well during the course of the year.", "Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets ", "Now if you look at Q1 in terms of seasonality I mean you based on your guidance you are expecting it to be somewhat similar to may be previous year's seasonal of trend taking last year aside, I mean what are really the drivers that you are seeing here in Q1, I mean was the assumptions really based on this guidance considering that we were exiting the holiday season maybe with a bit better inventory that we have previously.", "Judy Bruner", "Daniel this is Judy we are expecting a normal Q1 in terms of down demand in the season but we are not expecting a normal Q1 or historical Q1 in terms of pricing trends, if you look back at all of our previous Q1 there is typically been very significant downward pressure on pricing, and this time we believe that we entering 2010 with a healthy supply demand balance in the industry because there is really been no capacity added throughout 2009. So we do expect some movement down in pricing in the first quarter and somewhat more than the essentially no price decline we had in the fourth quarter, but definitely less price decline than we have seen in historical Q1.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.", "Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs", "Can I ask relative to the shifting of the business between retail and OEM what kind of impact do you think that really has in terms of your seasonal pattern that we have historically seen.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So we think that Q1 will have seasonality and that\u2019s based into the guidance that Judy has provided. OEM business may be a little less seasonal than the retail but overall the total business will experience seasonality similar to the year's past.", "Judy Bruner", "I would just add to that Jim, I think we answered this question last quarter as well that even when our products go through OEM channel ultimately almost all of our products destined for the consumer and so they are still subject to the seasonal buying patterns of the consumer", "Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs", "That\u2019s exactly what I was trying to figure out, I appreciate that and then Eli you had said relative to SSD, I think you said it was only a matter of time for SSDs in kind of the notebook space. Obviously we are seeing good adoption in the enterprise base you know how much time, how much is only a matter of time are we really talking about a year, or two years less than that?", "Dr. Eli Harari", "I think if you look again at the iPad, iPad is a very thin product it's designed absolutely to operate with flash memory. 64 gigabyte storage, no way that it can support a hard disk drive and of course doesn\u2019t have a DVD and I think that there is a whole class of devices like this where consumers will appreciate the other attributes of flash memory in terms of very low power, it's very responsive, (instruments) functions in small form factor to pay the premium. ", "If you look at the iPad price quote going from 32 gigabyte to 64 gigabyte a $100 incremental cost to the consumer which is not that much, that still translate to about $3.00 per gigabyte and I would kind of venture to bet my annual salary that there will be at big numbers, customers that want us to perform 64 gigabyte at $3.00 per gigabyte and yet you hear a lot of people saying need to give $0.50 per gigabyte in order for SSD to take off. I think when necessity becomes commoditized yes we need to do playing at these price range, but we have tremendous opportunities over the next several years. ", "But to answer your question I think this is an online profit, I've said the enterprise of course is already willing to pay the additional cost per gigabyte of flash and I think that by the end of this year and certainly into 2011, we are going to see more and more notebook computers and people asking and they willing to pay a lot more than $0.50 per gigabyte and of course within two years we have to be able to reach the $1.00 per gigabyte and I think that will be another important I don\u2019t want to say tipping point, but in another important milestone for SSD adoption in the mean time the SSDs these are getting much, much better for us as well as for competitors and I think that this a market that\u2019s interested and its going to go on becoming very important part by 2012, I have seen some estimates that this will be, that SSD will consume maybe 15% to 20% of the total NAND bit output and I think that that\u2019s about I am comfortable with that kind of range number.", "Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs", "You said for 2012 that was?", "Dr. Eli Harari", "2012, I said I have seen some industry projections of 15% to 20% of the total NAND bit consumption in SSD and I am saying yes I think that sounds about right.", "Operator", "And next is Tristan Gerra with Robert Baird", "Tristan Gerra - Robert Baird", "Looking at your cost reduction guidance for 2010 how should we weight this by quarter?", "Judy Bruner", "Sure Tristan I would say that it will be weighted somewhat more to the second half the year than the first half of the year and that\u2019s based on taking into account the timing of the technology transition during the year in production and then taking into account the lag in our business model in terms of when that\u2019s recognized in our P&L.", "Tristan Gerra - Robert Baird", "And in terms of your previously reserved inventories anything left that we should expect for Q1 given the amount it was higher than expected in Q4 or is that pretty at this point?", "Judy Bruner", "At this point really our inventory is carrying a normal level of reserves and when I say normal I can look back to when our product gross margins used to be back in the 30% range and our reserves now are at a very similar level, so I do not expect going forward to be talking about underlying product gross margin relative to reported product gross margin really we should be in a normal territory going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "Eli you talked about a lot of good demand drivers but you also mentioned 70% bit growth for the company which seems pretty low given the demand drivers in place. Can you reconcile that two of those for us?", "Dr. Eli Harari", "Yes, we just gone through the most difficult, the most challenging and most painful downturn and that memory is very, very much fresh in our mind, so we would rather be on the conservative side and it build our business on profitability rather than market share, so the OEM business definitely needs a captive supply and as our OEM grows, we need to take care of that and we are, but we really don't want to be very, very cautious and how we add additional supply, I think it's very important for our health and I think we don't want to contribute anymore then we have to, and we want to contribute to the health of the industry but for like this.", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "Okay and then the follow would be last year you talked a lot about moving to second sourcing model that was 28% to 30% of output, has that thinking changed and as we think about the more fully provisioning of Fab 4 how do we think about the timing with which you add tools there?", "Dr. Eli Harari", "Let me first answer the second question that provisioning of the remaining space in Fab 4 there is not that very much capacity left in Fab 4 and you can well imagine filling up what remains is cleaning space is very cost effective decline other than fixed cost basically in place already and therefore on running additional wafer yes you need new equipment installing, but the cost of wafer actually very favorable which is very different from the first trends of expansion of new capacity in a brand new Fab, whether it's an existing empty shell or a new facility that you built from the ground up the first, let's say 50,000, 70,000, 80,000 wafers per month carry the full fixed cost even though I am not choosing the full capacity available, so we think that business is very, very important element for us to take advantage of through our 50-50 option with our partner and of course this does come, this doesn't mean that we delayed the move to greater reliance on NAND captive but in general our designers continue to be relying on captive supply for a around at 15% to 25% or so of our future capacity and we do have the agreements in place and these NAND captive capacities that cannot obviously be turned on an instant you need to invest into qualified and someone at the appropriate time we plan to offset exercise those.", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "Well just the follow would be just with respect to adding and tooling how do we think about the pace which will do that through the year and into next year?", "Dr. Eli Harari", "We are not talking about a lot of wafers we are talking about increasing our captive supply by approximately 10% starting in the second half of this year so in terms of volume it's not that significant there is to a certain extent some constraints in terms of this lead time, equipment lead times but overall I think that it's not a major thing and I think it's definitely included in the industry projections of 70 to 90 nanometer and when we talk about that additional wafer start in the remaining cleaning space in Fab 4 that is part of our 70% of overall for our own capacity increases.", "Operator", "Gary Hsueh with Oppenheimer & Company.", "Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Company", "Eli just off the back of that question, I was wondering if you could help me understand how do you plan to be consistently close to 100% big growth beyond 2010. I think you talked a little bit about your strategy for non-captive to captive in 2010, but beyond 2010 I was wondering if you could kind of list of your options in terms of big growth outside of just pure technology transitions and what I am trying to get at is in terms of looking at the Toshiba have taken a part of Fab 5. What is on the considerations when you start to look at Fab 5 in Yokkaichi whether or not you participate in some volume option out of that fab?", "Dr. Eli Harari", "So in terms of strategy is to increase our output as soon as I just said, is to take advantage of the local structure that you made in the cleaning space Fab 4, the step after that is to tap into our non-captive supply and beyond that we would have to figure how to address future economies, but we do believe that 2010 is pretty matured to really start planning a the new fab or with regards to fab 5 as far as our requirements we don\u2019t think that fill 2010 is. It's immature so we have sent.", "Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Company", "Okay and second question is here Judy I understand for a full year basis on the cost per bit reduction is going to exceed your expectations for pricing decline. Can you walk me through the profile of each and whether you know the declines in terms of pricing and the cost per-bit reduction you planned are those totally coincidence or are they going to be gap here and there and anyone anyone caught there?", "Judy Bruner", "I think it's too difficult for us to give a specific quarterly pattern at this point in particular for price decline as I said in terms of the cost decline of 30% to 40% per-bit that will be a little more weighted in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year and overall we believe that the price decline for the year will be less than that cost decline but exactly how it plays out on a quarter-by-quarter basis, this is little too difficult and we wouldn\u2019t estimate it at this point but overall we are talking about a very healthy level of price decline for the industry and for ourselves in 2010.", "Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Company", "Okay and last question I think this must have been asked but let me just try and ask it again, in terms of the seasonal decline did you say that the OEM decline in Q1 was going to be a little bit less than the retail decline in Q1?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "OEM seasonality will be little bit less than retail and that's because we continuing to grow our business in the new channels and new customers.", "Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Company", "Can you be specific on what aspect of the OEM business you are growing is it microSD card attachment rate on handsets. Is that in particular what you are seeing?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "I think we have said in the last call that we are selling to private labels, customers as well as to customers for wafers and component into the private label customers we are primarily selling our card products and those cards are and those card are product include mobile product as well as some imaging products but as Judy pointed that almost 80% of our OEM revenue is mobile so it's primarily from the card side of course we are continuing to sell components and embedded products as well.", "Operator", "Next is Bob Gujavarty with Deutsche Bank.", "Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank", "I got just a question about 3-bit-per-cell at the moment are you able to use 3-bit-per-cell across all the different channels and product you serve or is it primarily aiming the certain product segment?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So we are using 3-bit-per-cell in all card format as well as USB flash drive format and the lower capacity product do not use 3-bit-per-cell as well as certain high capacity, high performance products and product such as our pSSD's and SSD's do not use 3-bit-per-cell.", "Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank", "Great and how about some of the embedded products are those primarily 2-bit-per-cell right now?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "No some of the embedded products are using 3-bit-per-cell now.", "Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank", "Great and if I can just one final quick one you mentioned in the last conference call you are giving your lead in 3-bit-per-cell. You are able to kind of sell the lower cost product at the equivalent 2-bit-per-cell ASP and that\u2019s good for SanDisk. Is that trend continuing for you?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Yes basically what we had said was that implementation of 3-bit-per-cell technology in our products is essentially seamless from the point of view of the consumer. Consumer cannot really tell the difference between a 3-bit-per-cell and 2-bit-per-cell and therefore in pricing our products we generally don\u2019t have a difference between 2-bit and 3-bit-per-cell.", "Dr. Eli Harari", "But I would like to add that we do believe that not all X3 is made equal and that our X3 insisting in controlling in providing the complete solution and the fact that we are now in our third generation X3 technology, and that will make a difference and that the fact that our products are transformed X3 products are transformed to the user is because we have learned how to manufactured these into to have basically equivalent compare it to X2. That is not the case of what we are seeing in the market for some of our competitor this is very similar to the early days and now it seems 2-bits-per-sell, when our competitors having some difficulty matching our performance with MLC and therefore during their transition period portrayed MLC at the time and in fact that so optimize to X3 today is somehow around with 2-bits-per-cell we don\u2019t agree with that.", "Operator", "Kevin Cassidy with Thomas Weisel Partners is next.", "", "Unidentified Analyst ", "", "Hi this is Gelta in for Kevin Cassidy, I just have a quick question on the captive, non-captive model for your non-captive may be going out to 2011 do you have a target margin range for that?", "Dr. Eli Harari", "Target we have always said in the past in the years non-captive that the margin clearly is going to not much, be inferior to the margin as we can get with our captive supply where we of course have to make the CapEx investments it's reasonable to expect that our supplier that supplying up even under best terms conditions does need to mix their margins and therefore the way we look at non-captive is very important that we are able to generate some contribution dollars even though it's reduce margin.", "Operator", "", "Uche Orji with UBS is our next.", "Uche Orji - UBS", "Eli, so let me to try to understand what you're saying on 2-bit-per-cell, how much of your production by the end of the year should contribute to set on how much is it now?", "Dr. Eli Harari", "So for 2009 in quarter our big production was slightly above 15% in 3-bit-per-cell and in Q4 of 2009 it was better than 50% and in 3-bit-per-cell and for 2010 we are looking at same thing better than 50% for 3-bit-per-cell and again keep in mind that we have a certain mix of the product that uses 3-bit-per-cell very well and second for such as the once I mentioned earlier low capacity card and some high performance product etcetera do not use for sale. Mix of the product we have easily we at a pretty comfortable levels that per sale.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Let me just little bit about if it particularly with regards to low capacity we are seeing the market for cards kinds of Bi-focus you have the 1, 2 gigabyte card very large unit volume business and the higher capacity cards more for the smartphones and it is the 1 and 2 gigabyte card that were the chips really don\u2019t get the benefit of X3 and our difference being on X2.", "Uche Orji - UBS", "", "Okay and in terms of the acceptance of 3-bit-per-cell, I mean it cannot the way you described it, it sounds like there is been no problem in terms of performance of those cards in the market place when should we expect that this could be put and also use in things like SSD, number of X3 cards now, of X3 products in things like SSD are there any issue why they are not being use in this kind of product as controller related issues?", "Dr. Eli Harari", "The industry is just basically this year moving from SLC 1-bit to MLC 2-bit-per-cell because the brand stand of these product in a very-very challenging kind of application environment that we have talked about in the past. We believe that it will require very substantial understanding and very powerful understanding if you will of system level expertise including not just ECC but all kinds of algorithm that we have developed and perfected over the last few years. ", "To make SSD, to make it possible to 3-bit-per-cell into SSD and that eventually it could become a very important element of that. Now that may not apply let say for enterprise drives where SSD drive where performance is very-very important but if science handling things like endurance and read/writes that I think that eventually we will be able to achieve most requirement in SSD with X3 per-cell but that is still to be improving our first focus this year is really on commercializing our 3rd generation 2 G3 2-bit-per-cell MLC and this is really our key focus.", "Uche Orji - UBS", "Okay great and then just one last question. I did ask you this question also last quarter it seems like the demand drive NAND seem to be so strong that the historical, and lastly few relationship between pricing and demand seems to be broken. How much long, are there market that you think will, at what point do you think that relationship gets restored, are we now a new card in terms of demand where ASP's falling at a rate that are not entirely what is and yet demand continuous to drop. So in terms of how you expect the relationship between product demand than lastly to going forward can you just try to give some color that will be helpful thanks?", "Dr. Eli Harari", "It\u2019s a very complex and layered question and answer is equally complex there are of course markets are more mature is therefore less elastic they are numerous new application that are very price elastic in general and then of course there's a general economy and consumer confidence some of the things that are outside of our control I would say that we always believed that pricing its healthy for the industry and for us to continually cost reduce and give and share the benefit of that with consumer so that expands and creates new markets, we have not changing our thinking only thing what I've said is that the rate of price reduction that we saw in the last three years which was close to 60% annually was disastrous and would not be supportable by cost reductions and we are seeing now good stability in the market and it is my hope that we are at the beginning of a long period of health in the industry with continuing price reduction and cost reduction. But at a level that makes economic sense ", "Operator", "Daniel Berenbaum with Ariga U.S.A.", "Daniel Berenbaum - Ariga U.S.A.", "Thanks Judy did you say that you sold some equipment in the quarter I was just trying to figure how free cash flows higher than cash flow from operations?", "Judy Bruner", "We didn\u2019t sale equipment but essentially we received a cash distribution and cash pay down on our notes receivables from flash partners. Our joint ventures actually generate cash and if they generate more cash than its required for capital investment any given period then they will return that cash to the partners. And since there was no new capacity added within our joint ventures in 2009 the joint ventures generated more cash than what\u2019s needed.", "Daniel Berenbaum - Ariga U.S.A", "And so then moving forward on the CapEx investment, you talk about 700 million and 900 million total investment, how will that be split out do you think your CapEx and the investment in the JV?", "Judy Bruner", "The vast majority of it will be investment in the joint ventures if you look at this year you see that our non fab or non joint venture CapEx was about 60 million for this year I expect it will be little bit higher than that next year but still the vast majority of the 700 to 900 is fab and therefore joint venture related. But we will give some more detail on that at our investor day.", "Daniel Berenbaum - Ariga U.S.A", "Okay and then last question is on OPEX you guided non-GAAP 725, 750 what you think stock be comp will be across the year so we can take stab at the GAAP numbers and then also on the patterns I mean it looks like it was sort of imply that OPEX would basically be flattish across the year I am I thinking about that\u2019s the right way?", "Judy Bruner", "Okay first on stock compensation we actually have some cables that are on the web that gives the reconciliation of the non-GAAP to the GAAP and what it shows there is that the operating expenses that we would add to the 725 to 750 to get GAAP or about 15 to 20 million a quarter or about 60 to 80 million for the year. And then in terms of your second question we are working very hard to keep expenses tight to manage them careful. ", "We will have a little bit of growth and expenses that as indicated in my guidance and I would expect as, typical there seasonality in that it tends to be heavier in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. But there is not it's not a hockey stick obviously to get to the 725 to 750.", "Operator", "", "And our next question will come from (inaudible) ", "Unidentified Analyst", "My first question is about the utilization rate Judy you mention that the growth in 2010 will be waited for second half do you still expect your facilities to run a full capacity right in fourth quarter and second quarter of 2010?", "Judy Bruner", "So I think somewhat two different questions there when I was saying was slanted more to the second half and the first half is our cost reduction in a per gigabyte basis, the timing of the 30% to 40% reduction in our cost per gigabyte, in terms of utilization I assume you are asking about fab utilization and absolutely we are running them at a 100% and expect to run them at a 100% for all of 2010", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then second question is in OEM space; what is your market share and is SanDisk gaining market share from others?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "In the OEM space it is hard to call out the market share because the OEM customer base is totally diverse and the information is not easily brought in but we believe that we are gaining market shares in the OEM space as well and particularly as we increase our new customers and new channels through that we are increasing our shares on the OEM side as well, and in the retail side as well we believe we did very well during the years and held a strong share despite from industrial personal profitability and in fact I believe in several others geographies, and retail as well we grew our shares during the year.", "Unidentified Company Speaker", "But in addition to that in retail, in quite a lot of countries we are very high market share and it's not that easy to dramatically increase that, in OEM in some accounts we are just adding in near, relatively small amount of share and we think we have significantly more upside in increasing our share there.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Mark we will take our last question.", "Operator", "And the final question will come from Paul Coster, JPMorgan.", "Paul Coster - JPMorgan", "I just want to go back to the whole issue of quiet drastic demand surely one of the reasons is breaking down as you have got this new product category small phones they are growing so rapidly and the attach rate to them is a 100% and my question is it just seems to me, Eli, that in every space we get close to the end of this year. With that with the sort of 30% gross of the product category the bottle neck is going to be way for out not big shipments and the industries is going to have to make some pretty serious decisions just I can say CapEx decision is just to stay up with smaller funds later on SSDs can you comment from that?", "Dr. Eli Harari", "You may be right Paul? we are not at that point at this stage and we will be very, very careful and we've been trying to learn from mistakes that we and others I mean consist for product, but they are positive so that exuberant irrational investment in the range of 60% of revenues for us CapEx in 2007 - 2008 and we are not going to return to that", "Paul Coster - JPMorgan", "I get that so maybe the supplemental question is if the industry has to stop making investments then what's the lead time with streamed the point of making the decision and when they say meaningful wafer out capacity increase can be achieved is it sort of 6 months a year?", "", "Dr. Eli Harari", "Our new fab is definitely longer than that, it's closer to 18 month if everybody rushes to the equipment manufacture of course there will be a bottle neck there. They are under consideration of course, NAND is slowing down and the future of NAND beyond let's say 20 nanometer is not certain and the portion on technology is not yet in place and new NAND are very expensive and really is not yet up to the technology. There is just a lot of other considerations that will come into play as far as new mega fabs and I think that right now this is actually time to kind of pause a little bit at least for us and let the market kind of develop a little bit before we make any further decision on that.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Thanks Paul that\u2019s all the time we have for today.

Today's call is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jay Iyer, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Anthony, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining us on the call today are Dr. Eli Harari, Chairman and CEO of SanDisk; and Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President of Administration and CFO.", "Before we begin, please note that any non-GAAP financial measures discussed during this call, as defined by the SEC in Regulation G, will be reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. That reconciliation is now available along with supplemental schedules on our website at sandisk.com/IR.", "In addition, during our call today we will make forward-looking statements.

First quarter results were considerably better than we had expected. Our OEM business was start at the quarter, driven by strong demand from our mobile customers as well as new channels and customers added in 2009.", "The OEM business accounted for 63% of total product revenue in Q1, and has been a stabilizing factor compensating for the first quarter seasonality in our retail business, which has yet to recover from the economic downturn in the U.S. and Europe. Our focus in retail continuous to be to maximize profitability, while expanding into new geographies where we believe we are making steady inroads.", "In the mobile end market we continue to see strong adopting of our iNAND embedded storage solutions as well as mobile card. Mobile has now grown to half of our product revenues, compares to virtually nothing five years ago.", "MicroSD has become the de facto cards in mobile phones and the market place has bifurcated into low capacity one and two gigabyte MircoSD cards for low end phones and high capacity for 32 gigabyte MircoSD card for high end Smartphone and we believe we hold strong leadership positions in both segments.", "The mobile market for FLASH is still in its early days. Just to remind you mobile Apps hardly existed and Smartphones were hardly household word just two years ago. The iPod along with other similar products is expected to drive demand for FLASH memory 64 gigabyte in higher capacities, where the DISK demand comes in the form of embedded storage or removable cards. We are now well positioned in both categories.", "We continue to gain traction with leading OEMs for our modular SSD solutions, Solid State Disk in netbook and public computers. In the first quarter we also entered the retail Solid State drive market with our G3 products. At current NAND pricing levels, SSD solutions are still expensive. However, we believe this market too should drive very substantial consumption of high capacity flash as it becomes much more affordable. We expect this will occur with add vented of 20Xnanometer flash memory technology in mass production next year, and with 1 X NAND technology in 2012.", "We're now executing to our aggressive solid disk road map that should take us to being top tier supplier as SSD adoption accelerates in net books, notebooks, and tablet PC platforms in the years ahead. On the operations and technology front we're very pleased with the ramp of our 32-nanometer technology as well as the continuing cost benefits that we see from broad implementation of our 3-bit-per-cell X3 technology into our products where we believe we are significantly ahead of competition. In the first, quarter our cost per gigabyte declined by 14% sequentially, continuing our highly competitive cost structure.", "As for the industry environment, demand and supply appears to be in balance for 2010. For our sales we now expect our captive bit output to increase in 2010 over 2009 by approximately 75%, up from approximately 70% estimated previously with outside coming late in the year from better productivity and Fab 4 expansion.", "Last month, Toshiba announced the intention to commence construction of the shell for a new clean image that will eventually be Fab 5. We're evaluating the timing of our participation in Fab 5, and we will provide further details as they become available later in the year.", "In summery the first quarter was a very-very good start for 2010. With our leading technology, large scale manufacturing, diversified end markets, broad product portfolio, premium brand, and a strong balance sheet, we have powerful momentum to capitalize on future opportunities and we believe that in the coming decade flash will be bigger than you think. I will now turn it over to Jude.", "Judy Bruner", "Thank you, Eli. We delivered our best ever first quarter results driven by strong OEM demand, minimal price reduction and continued execution in product cost reduction and expense management. Our total product revenue was down sequentially by 13% which was less than we had expected given historical Q1 seasonality and a 14-week fourth quarter.", "Our retail business reflected normal seasonality with revenue down 27% sequentially while our OEM revenue was down only 2% sequentially. As a result, the Q1 mix of our product revenue was 63% OEM and 37% retail. Our retail revenue grew 7% year-over-year, and our OEM revenue increased to 158% reflecting strong demand in the mobile market and the new channels we added in 2009. Looking at our revenue by end market, our first quarter product revenue came 49% from the mobile phone market, up from 38% in the first quarter of last year.", "Retail demand continued to be soft in Europe and the U.S while Asia retail sales increased sequentially from Q4 to Q1. We believe we maintained share in U.S retail while we may have given up some share in low priced USB products in Europe retail. In Asia, we benefited from strong consumer demand as well as from our geographic expansion efforts.", "Our first quarter OEM revenue benefited from strong demand in the mobile market and in general from new customers for mobile embedded solutions, cards, as well as wafers and components. Our overall ASP per gigabyte declined 7% in the first quarter much less than in the previous first quarter reflecting a healthy supply demand balance. And some of our 7% decline in ASP per gigabyte reflected the mix of product sold rather than price decreases.", "Our units sold decreased 3% sequentially and grew 62% year-over-year. Average capacity remained fairly steady as the pricing environment has created strong demand for lower capacity units. Average capacity was down 4% sequentially and up 5% year-over-year our total gigabyte sold declined 7% sequentially and grew 71% year-over-year.", "Our license and royalty revenue was slightly stronger than we had forecasted at $93 million and now fully reflects our new license agreement with Samsung. Our first quarter non-GAAP total gross margin of 46.5% and non-GAAP product gross margin of 41.5% benefited from a better than anticipated pricing environment and also from stronger than forecasted OEM sales that resulted in recognizing more of our 32-nanometer 3-bits-per-cell production in first quarter results.", "Our product gross margin improved sequentially from an underlying product gross margin of 36% in Q4 '09 to 41.5% in Q1 driven by a 14% sequential cost reduction on a per gigabyte basis, compared to our 7% decline in price per gigabyte.", "Non-GAAP operating expenses of 172 million were down 20 million from the fourth quarter reflecting a 13-week quarter compared to Q4's 14 weeks as well as seasonality in sales and marketing expenses.", "Our first quarter non-GAAP operating profit was 334 million or 31% of revenue, and as with the last quarter, more than 70% of this operating profit came from our product business. Our non-GAAP other income of 23 million included gains of 15 million related to the sale of certain assets and investments.", "On the balance sheet cash and short and long-term marketable securities increased sequentially by 279 million to nearly $3.3 billion. Our first quarter cash flow from operations was 328 million, and our cash flow from investing yielded a positive $1 million resulting in free cash flow of 329 million.", "During Q1, we called our $75 million convertible paying it off with cash, and we reduced our off-balance sheet equipment lease guarantees ending Q1 with a balance of 931 million.", "I will now turn to forward-looking commentary. Please note that non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation tables for all applicable guidance are posted on our website.", "Given our strong results in the first quarter, we are raising our guidance for 2010. Our broad channels and growing demand from the mobile market give us confidence to increase our full year revenue range to 4.5 billion to $4.8 billion.", "For the second quarter, we expect total revenue between 1.1 billion and 1.175 billion which reflects tightness in supply for certain low capacity products. Within this total Q2 revenue, we expect license and royalty revenue between 80 million and 90 million, slightly down sequentially since our second quarter royalty revenue reflects the seasonal first quarter revenue of our licensees. For the full year, we are also raising our expectations for license and royalty revenue to a range of 350 million to 375 million.", "Turning to gross margin, we expect a sequential improvement in cost to be less in Q2 than in Q1 due to anticipated higher mix of demand for certain products in our portfolio.", "We also expect our second quarter sales to reflect more promotional pricing in the retail channel associated with the moms, proms, dads and grad season. We expect non-GAAP total gross margin for Q2 between 42% and 45%, and non-GAAP product gross margin between 37% and 40%.", "For the full year 2010 we now anticipate that our cost reduction will be at the high-end of the 30% to 40% range we provided in January and we expect price reduction to be less than our previous estimates. Partially offsetting these factors we may utilize some non-captive supply in the second half of the year.", "We are raising our full year 2010 forecast for non-GAAP total gross margin to a range of 41 to 44%, and for non-GAAP product gross margin to a range of 36% to 39%. For the 2010 total gross margin this represents a more than 5 percentage point increase in the mid-point of the range from the previous guidance.", "Given our increased top line expectations for the year, we now expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be at the higher end of the range previously provided or approximately 750 million. For Q2 we forecast non-GAAP operating expenses of 180 to 190 million.", "We now expect non-GAAP other income to be approximately 60 million for the year and we forecast the non-GAAP tax rate to remain at approximately 37%. We expect our 2010 Capital Investments to be at the higher end of the 700 to $900 million range, we previously provided and the estimated cash requirement for 2010 Capital Investments remains in the range of 300 to 400 million concentrated later in the year.", "In summary, we are pleased with our first quarter performance and it is looking like 2010 will be a year in which we exceed the operating margin in our long-term financial model.", "We'll now open the call for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And, our first question will come from Daniel Amir from Lazard.", "Daniel Amir \u2013 Lazard", "Thanks a lot and congratulations on a great quarter.", "Eli Harari", "Thank you.", "Daniel Amir \u2013 Lazard", "A couple questions. First of all, can you highlight a bit what the drivers are incensing in your OEM business here going forward? And how should we look at kind of the OEM segment as a percentage of your overall sales here in the next two, three quarters?", "Eli Harari", "Hi. So, the OEM business is growing. I mean, we have said in the past that we believe we are now the third largest supplier now and certainly in the top three suppliers of OEM flash. And we believe that we have a tremendous room to grow, and talked about very large, very broad front of design-ins, particularly for embedded products, and we see that as really just starting.", "At the Analyst Day, we talked about AFM, that\u2019s the adopted flash management, which is part of our controller intelligence to allow us to optimized embedded flash to the specific application of the platform, and we're seeing very significant reception, productivity reception for that. So I would say that we probably have moved now quite solidly from a model where maybe a year ago or a little bit more than that we were maybe one third OEM and two-thirds retail to just opposite, one third retail and two-thirds OEM. And I don\u2019t \u2013 I expect to this thing is going to be with us for the foreseeable future.", "Daniel Amir \u2013 Lazard", "Great. And the other question is in terms of kind of the e-book and tablet markets and with your commentary that you\u2019re thinking of using some non-captive supply in the second half of the year. I mean how do you see those demand dynamics impacting the flash memory markets and then specifically your usage of potentially moving to a little more non-captive?", "Eli Harari", "So, the non-captive supply is very, very important in the long-term and we always said our model is to have 15 to 20% non-captive. However, it is also the case that with OEM becoming such a much stronger constituents portion of our output, I\u2019ve said many times that OEM really cannot be satisfied through non-captive because you have to quote several quarters out and we really have to have control of our supply, so that really will very likely to the extent that we stay with this two-thirds OEM, one-third retail moving forward, or around that, our ability to employ non-captive will be reduced and we will have to use more captive supply.", "Daniel Amir \u2013 Lazard", "And the tablet e-book question?", "Eli Harari", "So, can you repeat the question on tablet?", "Daniel Amir \u2013 Lazard", "Yeah, so basically how do you see the tablet e-book market impacting NAND flash industry here in 2010?", "Eli Harari", "Tablets to the extent that you defined the iPod as a tablet and its competitors being more or less the same, we view that as a very, very important new platform that drives the demand for flash because it is really designed to be very thin, very long battery life and therefore really relies on attributes of flash for storage.", "The iPod is driving 64 gigabyte. We fully expect that the competition will be really driving at the 64 gigabyte and opening up to 128 and 256 gigabyte. This is very, very positive development for the NAND industry no matter who serves it, and also very important because again the Analyst Day we talked about thin is in.", "What thin means when you have very thin products and you can't have a fan to cool the environment, you basically are driven to use modular flash which modular SSD which is SSD functionality but not necessarily in the 1.8 inch or 2.5 inch form factors, and that clearly plays to our strength because we have the ability to customize solid state disk to be basically to fit into very, very thin and any kind of profile which of course no disk drive can do.", "So in that kind of environment people are starting to look at SSD not just is it lower \u2013 does it match the cost of hard disk drive but more is it enabling technology that allows that kind of form factor.", "Daniel Amir \u2013 Lazard", "Thanks a lot.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Daniel. Next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.", "Kate Kotlarsky \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Hi. This is Kate Kotlarsky for Jim Covello. Eli, I had a quick question on the comments you made about supply being tight in general in 2010. I was just curious if you look at the second half versus the first half how much tighter at all do you think the second half of the year is going to be and kind of tying into that into your comments about evaluating Toshiba and what are the things that you're going to be looking at as you think about potentially making the investment in fab 5? Thank you.", "Eli Harari", "Okay, so there is a number of questions in that, so let me try and address those and I\u2019m sure there would be maybe a few other questions on that. So, Judy has indicated we're raising our guidance for the year from 4 billion to 4.4 to 4.5, 4.8. That's $500 million additional revenues which of course would require very substantial additional gigabytes, petabytes and units that we are forecasting we will need flash for this year.", "So of course the solution to getting that supply is from captive which is Fab 4, and then non-captive, and then anything we do with Fab 5 will definitely not have any impact.", "It will not be available until really 2011 at the earliest.", "So, this is what in my remarks I said we're striving to get our output this year to about 75% more bids this year, later in the year, and this comes from primarily greater efficiency in Fab 4, better yields than we had expected in Fab 4, as much utilization of X3 we can squeeze out of wafers and that's going very well and building some additional capacity in Fab 4 in the clean room space and there we're somewhat limited by equipment lead times and of course not much space left in there. So all of these in combination give you that 75% so increase and that may not be enough and in that case we will explore non-captive option.", "Kate Kotlarsky \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. So that's 75% implies that you're primarily using captive supply and not too much non-captive?", "Eli Harari", "That's correct, yes.", "Judy Bruner", "The 75% is the amount by which we believe we can grow our captive output.", "Eli Harari", "That's right.", "Judy Bruner", "In 2010.", "Kate Kotlarsky \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay.", "Judy Bruner", "Revenue in bits could potentially be more if we purchased non-captive and or we're able to increase our inventory turns.", "Kate Kotlarsky \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. That's very helpful. Can I just ask one additional question? That 75%, how does that compare to what you would expect for the industry in general. That's it for me. Thank you.", "Eli Harari", "So we said in the past that we think from what we see from various independent marketing firms, they're projecting between 70 and 90% bit increase and we said beginning of the year we're going to be unable \u2013 that we'll be up to 70%. Now, we are more confident that we can be about at 75%, still at the low end of that industry range.", "Kate Kotlarsky \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thank you so much.", "Jay Iyer", "Thanks, Kate. Next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Paul Coster with JPMorgan.", "Paul Coster \u2013 JPMorgan", "Yes, thank you. As you approach the CapEx decision along with your partner Toshiba, can you just talk to us a little bit about what's going into those discussions and also is there any chance that you may again revise the nature of the joint venture and the share of the JV that you own?", "Eli Harari", "Well. As you know, Paul, we announced more than two years ago in MOU with Toshiba and nonbinding memorandum of understanding with Toshiba for the creation of fab 5, and that of course ran into the recession that the whole industry and really was put on hold.", "About a month ago, Toshiba announced that they will commence the construction of the shell in the KG. This is basically a decision to build just a building. And we certainly plan to continue the partnership that we have with Toshiba in fab 5. However, I also said in the past and we really feel very strongly that we need to play our part as best we can to maintain health in the industry by not bringing our new capacity \u2013 any new capacity that we have from any new sources too soon to the market that would be not good for us and of course, we can't control what our competitors are doing. But basically this for the last, I term last quarter is curbing our enthusiasm.", "That said, we do need to \u2013 we do see demand for flash growing at a very strong pace both from the mobile and from other markets including SSD, and therefore we do \u2013 again, I have said on February 26, it\u2019s not a question of if we\u2019re going to participate in fab 5 but when, and to what extent and the timing and so on, and all of those have not yet been decided. And we will let you know when the decisions are being made.", "Paul Coster \u2013 JPMorgan", "Do you think that Toshiba shares your philosophy at the moment regarding being cautious about the introduction of new capacity?", "Eli Harari", "I think you have to ask Toshiba.", "Paul Coster \u2013 JPMorgan", "That\u2019s right, thank you very much.", "Jay Iyer", "Thanks Paul.", "Eli Harari", "Thanks Paul.", "Jay Iyer", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Bob Gujavarty with Deutsche Bank.", "Bob Gujavarty \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Thanks, guys, and fantastic job on the margins. I\u2019d just had a question given how the strong OEM sales have been. Do you get any sensor has this entered in to your discussion in terms of may be OEM pre-buying an anticipation of a shortage in the back half of the year? Have you kind of made some assumptions for that as you cleaned your backlog so to speak just the account for any possibility of pull-in of orders?", "Eli Harari", "Let me answer it without indirectly. We do feel that you heard me say as saying that in the next decade we think that flash already bigger than you think and that\u2019s really based on the mobile in the way it's going as well as that\u2019s obviously there is two major new markets that are very, very early, so the industry will need to build additional capacity that doesn\u2019t exist. I think we all know that, and you know the key is really the timing of those because the return on investment by itself is tied to the timing.", "Now, what that leads me to say is over the next several years there will be a period, I believe, of shortages of flash memory, and that will be times where people will understand, OEMs, particularly large OEMs, that flash is becoming very strategic to their business. You can view it as a commodity, but when you can't get it at any price because it is just not there because your demand far exceeds the available capacity of the industry, and the cumulative demand of all customers, then of course people will start wanting to secure for themselves some of that capacity, so I do expect some of that may happen.", "Of course we don't know for a fact, but I would not be surprised if the strategic nature in the next few years is going to become effective. It's no secret flash is a very, very tough technology. There are very few companies that can really deliver leading-edge technology, very high volume, both from the technology and the manufacturing and the balance sheet. So the answer to your question is yes, I think there is going to be some of that but there are some OEMs will start taking steps to assure themselves of supply.", "Bob Gujavarty \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Great. Thanks.", "Judy Bruner", "Bob, this is Judy. I will just add that at present time we worked very closely with our customers, and we monitor both the retail channel inventory and the OEM channel inventory and we believe that both are at normal levels today.", "Bob Gujavarty \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, great. And just a quick follow-up. I know we've had good positive retail sales data out of the U.S. Is there \u2013 are you at all more hopeful maybe now than three months ago or any color on the retail side of the business, not suggesting you give us the December prediction, but is there any inkling of hope there on that side?", "Eli Harari", "Yes, I think so. I mean, I think that the U.S. retail and Europe retail depends very much on the recovery in the economy and to the extent that people being a lot more optimistic about return of growth, even slow growth would be very helpful.", "Bob Gujavarty \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Great, thanks a lot.", "Jay Iyer", "Thanks, Bob. Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Uche Orji with UBS", "Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "Eli, now first of all congratulations on the terrific set of results. Let me just ask you about your confidence getting access to non-captive supply. Right now demand supply is imbalance like you mentioned, but is there any anyway you feel for sure that being able to tap non-captive supply and has this already been negotiated prices or will you spending on what the spot market doing in terms of your future dependence on non-captive?", "Eli Harari", "We have legal agreements that afford us guaranteed access to capacity from several of our licensees. However, it is again, I\u2019ve said in the past that you can't turn it off on a switch; you can\u2019t just come and say okay, next week shipment. There is forecasting, there is lead time and it is not something you can jump it's not that easy.", "Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "Okay.", "Eli Harari", "There is a lead time involved.", "Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "Different question. I mean, you were talking about low capacity NAND that you sighting at being popular. Are these in retail or OEMs and if in OEMs what kind of product are using the lower capacity NAND?", "Eli Harari", "So I think the main driver for low capacity cards mostly MicroSD one or two be about amazingly there is a huge number of handsets in \u2013 in countries such as China, India, South America and so on, and Africa, where you can get a very good handset for $20 or $25 and those forms used to rely almost entirely on embedded flash, lower flash or non-capacity NAND flash and just in the last several quarters they seem to have switched in very large quantities to a card slot MicroSD in 1 or 2 gigabytes and play music and actually FM radio and they become now the music player and some of them for 25 bucks you have camera.", "So traditionally, we expect that the 1 gigabyte and 2 gigabyte to even kind of disappear but it has come back because of these phenomena. We think it is here to stay, I mean for a long time.", "Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "I see. And then just particularly the last one, how much of your bit production in Q1 was 24-nanometers and within the 24-nanometers, when will the X3 or X4 be qualified and in full production?", "Eli Harari", "We have said that 24-nanometer is in development right now.", "Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "Okay.", "Eli Harari", "The advanced development and that we expect to start production by late this year.", "Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Is there any cost differential in terms of a CapEx cost to add capacity say 10,000 wafers demand incremental capacity at 24? How does that compare with the previous generation if at all just for us to have a sense of what this means for you from a CapEx cash flow standpoint? Thank you.", "Eli Harari", "Every generation of technology migration does acquire CapEx investments usually to far less degree than starting just wafers from scratch. And, it depends what kind of not that, different companies have different transitions between technologies. In our case, the technology \u2013 I am sorry \u2013 our 2-nanometer technology and our 24-nanometer technology require relatively small equipment changes, so that's actually very positive.", "Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "Right. Well. Thank you very much.", "Jay Iyer", "Thanks, Uche. Next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.", "Craig Ellis \u2013 Caris & Company", "Yeah. Thank you, Eli. Congratulations.", "Eli Harari", "Thank you.", "Craig Ellis \u2013 Caris & Company", "The first question is on just your cost reduction. Can you help us understand the linearity of the cost reduction that you hope to achieve this year, more front end loaded, relatively balanced, anything that would cause it to be lumpy through the year?", "Judy Bruner", "Craig, I would say that even how much of the cost reduction we were able to pull into the first quarter that in terms of sequential improvement in cost per bit, I expect that Q1 may be a quarter that is difficult to repeat, but relative to the other quarters, I don\u2019t necessarily expect much difference between the Q2, Q3, Q4 in the approximate level of cost decline and as I said, we expect the full year to reach a cost improvement at the high-end of our range of 30 to 40%.", "Craig Ellis \u2013 Caris & Company", "Okay. That makes sense and then Judy, just on the outlook for the year, looks like there is unusual degree of stability and revenues from the first half to the back half. Does that reflect concern about the strength of the retail business in the back half of the year does that reflect concern about supply availability beyond your captive bit growth? How do we interpret the implication for the second half growth off of the full year guidance?", "Judy Bruner", "It does reflect some potential shortage of supply, particularly for the low capacity product that we just discussed a few minutes ago the 1 and 2 gigabyte memory, and at the moment, as we indicated, the retail business does remain somewhat soften the U.S. and Europe and we\u2019re optimistic that we\u2019ll begin to see some improvement later in the year, but we haven\u2019t seen that yet.", "Craig Ellis \u2013 Caris & Company", "Okay. Congratulations again and thank you.", "Eli Harari", "Thank you.", "Jay Iyer", "Thanks, Craig. Next question, Anthony?", "Operator", "Next question comes from Kevin Cassidy with Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Oh, hi, this is Neely [ph] for Kevin. I was just hoping you guys could may be tell me what the mix was between 3-bit and 2-bit for the quarter and what they might be looking like while going forward?", "Judy Bruner", "We are not going to give a specific mix but our 3-bit-per-cell was above 50% in the first quarter and we expect it to remain approximately 50% or bit more for the entire year.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And I also wanted to follow-up on a previous question regarding, I guess some of the cost benefits that you guys might have going from sort of the 34 nanometer 3-bit to sort of 20 nanometer 2-bit, if you could just maybe elaborate little bit on that?", "Eli Harari", "Actually we are 32 nanometer and some of our competitors [ph] are 34 nanometer. Actually it's only because people are talking about throwing numbers about what is 2X. Now we have 20 nanometer class which means whatever you want. It has a two in somewhere in the number. Anyway from 32 nanometer \u2013 first of all, 32 nanometer from 43 nanometer is very substantial cost reduction, and particularly if you stay 3 bits to 3 bits, 43 nanometer X3 to 32 nanometer X3.", "As we get to lower geometries more scaled, I am sure again I said before we expect the difficulty of implementing X3 will increase but we feel they were playing to our strength. So we fully expect that when we go to 24-nanometer we will be able to take our X3 with us without in anyway comprising performance.", "So from 32 to 24 again pretty substantial cost reduction and basically you're looking at \u2013 we have said NAND is going to start slowing down and we truly believe that, but at the same time the industry and we are moving still at a pretty rapid pace and I would say that the end of scaling of NAND has probably been greatly exaggerated, maybe by us as well. So, actually it's looking a little bit better all the time and that of course would be very good news for SSD particularly.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you, guys.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you. Next question, please?", "Operator", "Next question will come from Daniel Berenbaum with Auriga USA", "Daniel Berenbaum \u2013 Auriga USA", "Hi, afternoon. Thanks for taking my call. First question, what is the progress on getting 3-bits-per-cell into OEM? I know there had been some reliability concerns as you move to 3-bits-per-cell. How much are you selling into OEM currently and are you going to be able to expand that?", "Eli Harari", "Initially it has been an uphill battle but it is getting better now because we have been able to demonstrate to very exhaustive OEM qualifications that the product is very, very good and further more through this AFM adaptable flash memory we can actually get very good performance with X3 and everybody understands that the cost benefits of that. So, I would say the efforts of the last year are beginning to bear fruit right now, and I think once we're over the hump that people will hold still to adopt X3.", "Daniel Berenbaum \u2013 Auriga USA", "Okay. I am sorry, I should have said embedded actually.", "Eli Harari", "Yes, I am talking about embedded.", "Daniel Berenbaum \u2013 Auriga USA", "You're talking about embedded.", "Eli Harari", "It is removable cards we have been shipping. We are the ones that qualify X3 and clearly as that moves into production very early.", "Daniel Berenbaum \u2013 Auriga USA", "So that progress on X3, does that change your long-term view on what you can do for cost per bit reduction? Does that improve that longer term view? Related to that, Judy said that you expect operating margin to year to be above the long-term business model. You just have a very strong quarter. Why does that quarter not change your view of what the long-term business model should be? Can you just help me understand why \u2013 how you're thinking about that?", "Eli Harari", "Yeah. Let me start with the second part of your question. At our analyst day at the end of February when I laid out the long-term financial model, I described that model as a model that we believe is optional over the long-term in order to balance growth and profit and cash flow. I said that in some years we expect that we will beat the long-term financial model and in some years we will miss it, so it is not my expectation to continue to adjust that long-term financial model, but rather aim for that over time and what I am saying is it looks like this year is a year where we can beat the long-term financial model. And I am sorry. What was the first part of your question?", "Daniel Berenbaum \u2013 Auriga USA", "Just on the good progress on getting 3-bit-per-cell into embedded, does that change your view of the longer term cost reduction? I think you talked about longer term cost reduction as 20% to 30% per bit annually. Does that improved adoption of 3-bits-per-cell into embedded change the view of that?", "Eli Harari", "No, because we assumed it in the first place. We of course assumed success, not \u2013 so we are marching to our plan and we\u2019re doing well against our plan.", "Daniel Berenbaum \u2013 Auriga USA", "Okay, great. Thanks very much.", "Jay Iyer", "Thanks, Daniel. Next question, please.", "Operator", "Next question will come from Hendi Susanto with Gabelli.", "Hendi Susanto \u2013 Gabelli", "Hi, all. Thank you for taking my questions. First, I would like to understand more about your plan with regard to the non-captive supply. Like, how much confidence do you have in securing 10% to 15% of the coming from the non-captive supply and how much is the maximum like non-captive supply can you get in the second half of 2010 meaning that whether you will be able to secure more than the 10% to 15% that you mentioned before. And could you help us understand and quantify what gross margin impact of using non-captive supply?", "Judy Bruner", "So, let me clarify. We\u2019ve not given any percentage of non-captive for the second half of this year. And when Eli was describing a 10 or 15%, he was saying that that was sort of the range that we think we might be in \u2013 in some periods of time over time. I expect that if we use non-captive in the second half of this year it will probably be modest amounts of non-captive but it is one factor that we are taking into account in our expectations of gross margins for the second half.", "Hendi Susanto \u2013 Gabelli", "Okay.", "Eli Harari", "And the second margin implications.", "Hendi Susanto \u2013 Gabelli", "Yes. And, then \u2013", "Judy Bruner", "Yes.", "Eli Harari", "The margin implications, as we said before of course, that this is a much lower-margin business.", "Hendi Susanto \u2013 Gabelli", "And then you mentioned that for OEM business there is a need of using more captive supply. And how about solid state describe will the choice of non-captive versus captive supply matter in SSD?", "Eli Harari", "Yes, very much so. Certainly a big part of the SSD market will be OEM, very much so in OEM. They will of course be the retail space in retail it can be non-captive, but I have to say that for SSD we have a very substantial engineering effort and I could tell you that it\u2019s very, very focused on squeezing out the best performance from the flash that we know best which is on captive flash, so it\u2019s very difficult to get the kind of performance that we feel we can deliver in an SSD environment at the low cost, very high performance, and great for liability we feel that the best approach is to use captive for that, even for retail.", "Hendi Susanto \u2013 Gabelli", "Okay. And one last quick question. For the low capacity memory product how is the margin compared to your corporate average margin? Is it lower or is it comparable or higher?", "Eli Harari", "The margin is very good. And just as an aside, we have said that the new channels that we have today that we didn't have a year ago really has given us the diversification to allow us to make decisions of how we allocate our supply, how between these markets based on maximizing profitability.", "Hendi Susanto \u2013 Gabelli", "Thank you.", "Jay Iyer", "Thanks, Hendi. Next question, please?", "Operator", "Nest question will come from Caitlin Wolford [ph] with Ardent Capital Management.", "Caitlin Wolford \u2013 Ardent Capital Management", "Good afternoon and, wow, great job. Just a quick question and you may have gone over this at the analyst meeting which I missed. Did you say on the call that you were slightly north of 50% on the 3 bit technology?", "Judy Bruner", "Yes.", "Caitlin Wolford \u2013 Ardent Capital Management", "Okay. And then that my question is assuming standard node for each 2 and 3 bit, is the number of die per 12-inch wafer similar?", "Eli Harari", "Yes. Yes, you just get \u2013 yes, very similar, you just get more bits per wafer.", "Caitlin Wolford \u2013 Ardent Capital Management", "Right. Okay. And then \u2013", "Eli Harari", "Wafer die and (inaudible).", "Caitlin Wolford \u2013 Ardent Capital Management", "And then assuming a similar process node, is there a significant difference in terms of how the line is configured or the equipment between the two different technologies?", "Eli Harari", "No. Essentially identical.", "Caitlin Wolford \u2013 Ardent Capital Management", "So to move, you can move rapidly say within a quarter by moving 2 bit equipment to 3 bit line?", "Eli Harari", "Within a day maybe.", "Caitlin Wolford \u2013 Ardent Capital Management", "Within a day? Great, okay. That answered my question. Thanks so much, and great to have you guys doing so well.", "Judy Bruner", "Thank you.", "Jay Iyer", "Thanks, Caitlin. Next question, please?", "Operator", "Next question will come from Betsy Van Hees with Wedbush.", "Betsy Van Hees \u2013 Wedbush", "Thanks for taking my call and congratulations on a fantastic quarter. I was wondering if you could help us understand in regards to the new channels of that 626 million in revenue that you did in the OEM, how much of that came from the new channel.", "Judy Bruner", "Betsy, we're not going to break out the specific mix of old channels versus new channels, but I will say that our business from new channels and new customers that we added in 2009 did grow sequentially from Q4 to Q1.", "Eli Harari", "And it is quite substantial.", "Betsy Van Hees \u2013 Wedbush", "And it is quite substantial in terms of the growth or the percent of the overall?", "Eli Harari", "Both.", "Betsy Van Hees \u2013 Wedbush", "Okay", "Eli Harari", "Well, the percentage for sure.", "Judy Bruner", "Percentage, yes, but it did grow. As I said, our OEM revenue in total was down sequentially 2%, although keep in mind that was going from a 14 week quarter to a 13 week quarter. But regardless the new channels and new customers grew sequentially from Q4 to Q1.", "Betsy Van Hees \u2013 Wedbush", "Thanks, that's very helpful. So, as we look at the back half of the year and the concerns that you seem to be highlighting about capacity constraints and supply, what's that going to do to your new channels and your new relationships as you're looking at trying to allocate the supply that you're going to have to your various new businesses?", "Eli Harari", "Well, we are looking at all of these channels as strategic and long-term, and we understand that to do so, if we have to get into allocation we have to do so in a very sensible way and to spread the pain if you will. But our number one priority frankly is to see what we can do in the supply side so that we don't constrain our customers.", "Betsy Van Hees \u2013 Wedbush", "Thanks so much and once again congratulations on a fantastic quarter.", "Eli Harari", "Thank you", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Betsy. Next question, please.", "Operator", "Question will come from Tristan Gerra with Robert Baird.", "Tristan Gerra \u2013 Robert Baird", "Hi, what were your channel inventories at the end of Q1 for flash cards? I think you were at around five weeks last quarter?", "Judy Bruner", "Our retail channel inventory on a worldwide basis is at about 7.5 weeks on a backward looking basis at the end of Q1 and that's very similar to what it was at the end of Q1 last year. It is a very normal range. It tends to be lower at the end of Q4 on a backward looking basis because of the very strong sell through in the December timeframe.", "Tristan Gerra \u2013 Robert Baird", "Great. Thank you.", "Jay Iyer", "Thanks, Tristan. Anthony, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Our last question will come from Atif Malik with Morgan Stanley.", "Atif Malik \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hi, thanks for taking my questions, nice quarter, quick clarification, Judy. The full year gross margin guidance assumes non-captive supply buying in second half this year?", "Judy Bruner", "It assumes some potentially modest amount in the second half.", "Atif Malik \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then, Eli, the question supply, if you look at equipment makers in a backlog of very little NAND equipment in the backlogs like photography there is something different about this time, this year, on NAND spending, you guys and others like Samsung have been very disciplined in placing even on shrink any increment spending.", "So my question is there anything fundamentally different in terms of technology, EUV, not ready, and two year's time that's giving NAND makers a pause or discipline that we will be in this kind of spending behavior longer and if we do as supply, it will be added in very small increments like you have announced 10% kind of incremental capacity? Is there anything fundamentally different about this time?", "Eli Harari", "No. And with regards to EUV, EUV still is quite away \u2013 away from a mass production and certainly for very high volume production. So I think the assumption is that the demand growth will overwhelm existing capacity and that new fabs that use existing, the photography and existing NANDs scaled to as far as it will go will have to be built to meet the demand in the next \u2013 I would say really two to five years.", "Atif Malik \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, thanks.", "Jay Iyer", "Thanks, Atif.", "Eli Harari", "Okay. Well, thank you very much. This is great. And as we said, we are looking forward to \u2013 this is a very good start and a good 2010. Thank you very much.

", "John Coyne", "", "Thanks Bob. Good afternoon and thank you joining us today. Overall demand for hard drives in the March quarter was stronger than we anticipated at 163 million units. As we saw a sequential industry time, grow 2% in contrast to a typical seasonal decline of five to 7%. This adds support to the growing body of evidence that in the midst of significant economic uncertainty over the last 12 months, the creation, transmission, consumption and storage of digital content has become much more pervasive in our lives than anyone had previously appreciated. ", "Over the last year, we have seen increasing levels of demand for high capacity cost effective storage. We believe this demand is at core driven by the ubiquitous role of digital content in every day life. Spared in the consumer segment by increasingly versatile and powerful handheld devices and PCs with new and attractive price points, and in the commercial sector by a drive for growth and efficiency especially in developing markets. ", "Industry inventory, OEM, distribution and retail combined remains at just over two weeks of sales, reflecting continued strong demand, continuing spotty constraints in the industry supply chain and continued industry discipline in managing the supply demand dynamic. For more than eight years now WD has generated sustained profitable growth and outstanding returns for our shareholders by consistently executing to our customer centric business strategy with passion, focus and perseverance. ", "Customers continued to demonstrate a strong preference for WD products in the March quarter. And this enabled us to again post record unit shipments and revenue with strong profitability. We\u2019re very pleased that in such a dynamic environment we again helped our customers to succeed in their markets by responding quickly to their changing requirements for volume and mix. A relatively moderate pricing environment combined with our cross segment agility and our focus on cost and efficiency, once again enabled gross margins above the high end of our model range. ", "Asset management remained crisp resulting in record cash generation. We continued to innovate and lead and multiple markets based on the significant investments we have made in people, products, processes, capacity and technology over the last few years with several recent notable product achievements. ", "In our client business, we began volume shipment of the industries highest aerial density, Standard 2-Disk, 2.5 inch drive, the 750 gigabyte WD Scorpio Blue Hard Drive for mainstream notebook computers. We doubled the capacity of the WD VelociRaptor, the worlds fastest SATA hard drive to 600 gigabytes delivering high performance and capacity for both enthusiast and enterprise customers. ", "We launched our first consumer oriented solid state drive family, the WD SiliconEdge Blue in capacities up to 256 gigabytes. In our branded products business, this week we introduced a new app for the iPhone called WD Photos, a photo viewer that gives our customers quick access to all their photos stored on their My Book World Edition or WD Share Space network drives from their iPhone or iPod Touch. Also specifically designed for Mac users, we added a new high speed My Passport Studio Family and a one terabyte Passport SE to our range of popular hard drives. ", "In the CE market, we launched the WD AV-25 range of 2.5 inch SATA drives engineered specifically for demanding always on multimedia streaming applications such as DVR and surveillance. We also introduced the My Passport AV media drive family optimized for video storage and playback and designed to work directly with select Sony camcorders, Blu-ray players and other popular media players. ", "In the embedded market, we introduced the WD silicon drive in 1X family of (SLZ) based solid-state drives with capacities up to 128 gigabytes delivering high performance and high reliability for embedded system OEM applications. Our participation in the traditional enterprise market, part of our portfolio diversification and expansion strategy which started with the shipment of our 2.5 inch 10K SAS product line beginning in early November is preceding inline with our measured multiyear plan to establish solid experience and a representative share in this important market segment. ", "We remain committed to continued investment in the development of our people, technology, product breadth and appropriate capacity while enhancing the advantage business model we have developed over the last several years. In responding to our customers needs and earning their business in the fastest growing markets we provide a critical combination of quality and reliability, portfolio breadth, technology and product availability under pinned by our low cost model, our vertical integration, our rapid inventory turns and our balance sheet strength.

We believe that calendar year 2010 will be an extremely strong year for storage and we\u2019re excited about the opportunity to continue to satisfy customer requirements to meet this demand. ", "Before I pass the call to Tim Leyden, I want to mention that tomorrow Friday April 23, WD will mark its 40th Anniversary spending four decades of innovation, passion, perseverance and success. I want to acknowledge the contributions of our thousands of employees our customers and suppliers in helping us every step of the way. In particular I want to acknowledge the team\u2019s outstanding execution in ceasing the customer opportunities that emerge throughout the most recent quarter which has further strengthened WD in our long term mission of generating sustained profitable growth. Tim? ", "Timothy Leyden", "", "As John noticed, the overall market was stronger than anticipated during the March quarter. Once again our agile business model allowed us to scale up our supply and adjust our mix to respond to the demand in the more robust segments of the market. This combined with moderate price declines and our low cost focus contributed to growth margin exceeding the upper threshold of all model range and our implied guidance. ", "Revenue for our third fiscal quarter was $2.6 billion, up 66% from the prior year and 1% sequentially. Hard drive shipments totaled 51.1 million units, up 62% from the prior year period and 3% sequentially. Revenue from sales of WD TV Media Players and solid-state drives totaled approximately $46 million, up 48% from the prior year and essentially flat with the December quarter. Average hard drive selling price was approximately $51 per unit, up $1 from the year ago quarter and down $1 from the December quarter. Growth in emerging markets and recovering commercial segment let the desktop growth being stronger than expected. ", "Pricing remains stable as a result of the unexpectedly strong demand. We shipped 19.8 million mobile drives in the March quarter, compared to 10.1 in the year ago quarter and 21.2 million in the December quarter. We reduced our mobile volumes in response to the expected seasonality in branded products and to balance the effect of competitors in the mobile market, who diverted their capacity from the gaming segment. ", "During the March quarter, we shipped 4.6 million drives into the DVR market compared to 3.5 million in the year ago quarter and 4.1 million in the December quarter. Our strong product line up led to revenue gains in both our OEM and channel businesses. Revenue from sales of our branded products including WD TV was $467 million, up 36% from $343 million from the year ago quarter and down 18% sequentially from $569 million in the December quarter, reflecting the typical seasonality of the retail market. ", "On the enterprise front there was strong sequential demand for our near line storage products and our SAS products are making progress towards our multiyear plan to gain a representative share of the traditional enterprise market. Moving onto our sales channels and geographic results. Revenue by channel was 49% OEM, 33% distribution and 18% branded products in the March quarter, compared with 48%, 30%, and 22% in both the year ago and December quarters. ", "Relative to the geographic lateral revenue, the Asian market showed continued strength increasing to 52% of revenue in the March quarter from 46% in the year ago quarter and 50% in the December quarter. The Americas and European regions performed as expected at 24% for the Americas and 24% for Europe in the March quarter, compared to 26% and 28% in the year ago quarter and 25% and 25% in the December quarter.

It has stayed pretty much constant from where it was at the December \u2013 at the end of December and I\u2019m talking about the manufacturing, component and retail which is just above two weeks of sales run rate. Relative to our own inventory, we\u2019re carrying a little bit more width and components inventory in all that accounts that are shortages.

We are working diligently with our supply base to ensure that WD supports the growth opportunities of our customers in relation to that anticipated market size. There is a risk that it will be hotter than that, given that we\u2019re not only are we seeing the strength we\u2019ve seen in the last 12 months in consumer which has been considerable and above everyone\u2019s expectations, now being augmented by the beginnings of a corporate purchasing cycle. ", "If I had to bet on which end of that range would come up or to be the high end with possible topside opportunity from a TAM perspective. We\u2019re working with a supply base to support that, its going to be a real stretch, as a result of last years economic recession, the level of capital investment that was made during that period was minimal and we\u2019ve been in catch up mode ever since and supply base for capital equipment is pretty stretched. So even we\u2019re the best one in the world, we\u2019re going to have difficulty as an industry I believe across the entire supply chain in fully reaping the benefits of that opportunity.

Your line is open.", "Ananda\u00a0Baruah \u2013 Brean Murray", "I guess just sort of to piggyback off of that, what \u2013 how should we think about or can you help us think about sort of the moving parts around pricing as we go into the second half of the year, what you think about what you\u2019re seeing on mix right now and maybe if you hit the higher end of that range.

As you look at \u2013 you talked a lot about the dynamics of the second half of the year from the demand side. Is there any numbers that you could help us think about what you think the industry is setting up from a supply side, from a capacity side?", "John Coyne", "I think we're probably pretty confident looking across all the different pinch points in the market and there are many that the low end of the range that I outlined is on a track to be supportive. As we move further into the middle to high end of that range, I think we're going to squeak a bit and we're going to have to work hard to accomplish support for those larger numbers.", "Keith Bachman \u2013 Bank of Montreal", "Okay. Then my follow up question to that would be if we can impute what the growth margin is for your June quarter guidance but it seemed like then under that scenario supply/demand that if we looked at second half of the calendar year, the gross margins that we should be thinking about would be more akin to what you just demonstrated in the March quarter. Is that a reasonable line of thinking?", "John Coyne", "Yes, I mean we're looking at that, as you say with the prospect of increasing demand and the advantages that we have with all vertically integrated mode and improving segment mix and focus on profits by any other players, and we think that there is an opportunity for us to be able to expand that margin if those conditions come true.", "Operator", "Mark Moskowitz with JPMC. Your line is open.  ", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JPMC", "Yes, thank you, good afternoon, two quick questions. One is just kind of following on the prior question from Keith; as far as the gross margins are concerned, can you give us a sense in terms of your ability to kind of cherry pick the last quarter (inaudible) serving the higher cap and in your quality and your ability to meet volume commitments. Was that higher in the last quarter too versus in the last year and could that only increase going forward just given that some of your peers still have some technology issues?", "John Coyne", "The larger we get the more difficult it is to cherry pick the market in the sense that as a broad line supplier to all of the major market players \u2013 of necessity on our size and scale, we need to support their total business rather than trying to cherry pick their business. Obviously, as you go to smaller players in the business and we knew how to do this very well when we were smaller, you can pick and chose the business you wish to do. But I think at our size and scale there is a certain obligation to broadly support our customers\u2019 businesses. And again back to the tightness we anticipate in the back half of the year, I'm sure we will work with customers in that environment to support their overall needs, which may involve some mixing to generate increased volumes from a restricted component supply.", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JPMC", "Thanks, John. The second question revolves around that tightness that you alluded to earlier in response to Ben's question and I appreciate the detail you provided because it does sound \u2013 we take what you said and what your competitors see if that is around CapEx, the folks are being quite disciplined and rational. I'm trying to get a sense in terms of if this tightness really does manifest and to sustain in the back half, given WD\u2019s cash position would you be flexible or creative in terms of maybe pulling out cash upfront of some of your suppliers in the supply chain to make sure you have the necessary supply versus your competitors, whether (inaudible) media?", "John Coyne", "Well, certainly while we don't talk about specific strategies, I think if you take a look back at WD\u2019s progress over the many, many years now. One of our strengths is to provide availability to our customers and in order to do that and in order to provide the kind of responsiveness that we\u2019ve demonstrated in many occasions of unexpected demand and on other occasions of expected robust demand, you have to have a very good relationship with the supply base and we believe we have that and we work very closely with our suppliers to ensure that we have the ability to support our customers and we are doing that as we speak.", "Operator", "Aaron Rakers with Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Yes thanks, two questions as well, obviously. You know, first on the notebook business, it looks by my math you guys were also down about 7% or so sequentially I guess the question is, do you endorse Seagate\u2019s comment that the overall industry was more or less flat on a sequential basis and if that\u2019s true, who do think is kind of taking share and do you think that you guys recapture share here as we move forward?", "John Coyne", "I think the 2.5 inch space was roughly flat quarter-over-quarter. As Tim mentioned in his remarks, I mean we diverted some of our builds capacity and supply chain capacity to 3.5 inch where we saw significant strength in demand and that offered a better business opportunity for us in a overall restricted supply situation. So we focused on those areas, which offered us the best return.", "As you go down or go to other competitors particularly those who traditionally have serviced the gaming market, which is as heavy demand for 2.5 inch in the back half of the calendar year, to them the business at least attractive to us in the first couple of quarters of the year looks highly attractive relative to gaming. ", "So typically they divert their seasonally available capacity that was dedicated to gaming in the back half of the year, they diverted it to the low end of the 2.5 mainstream business in the first couple of quarters that would typically be the component supply into the second tier branded external storage box manufacturers and some diversion into notebook support.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, that's helpful. And then the follow-up question understanding that you guys \u2013 probably it\u2019s too early to look out to fiscal 2011 at the point but any general thoughts on CapEx and in that I believe in this year you guys have like an incremental $200 million spend related to some wafer upgrades going on, do we kind of think about stripping that completely out as we go into fiscal 2011 in terms of your CapEx?", "Timothy Leyden", "Now that \u2013 well, first of all it's too early for us to talk about FY 2011. But the $200 million that you mentioned that's historical in the sense that a couple of years ago we were indicating that it was going to cost us $400 million (and albeit) be able to bring our capability from 6 inch up to 8 inch wafer. We spent close to half of that, a bit less than half of that in order to prove the capability. And then when the downturn came during the course of last year, we postponed that. So that actually has to come in and will be included in the number that we provide next year.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "So that's not in the 750 just to be clear?", "Timothy Leyden", "No, it's not.", "Operator", "Kevin Hunt with Hapoalim Securities. Your line is open.", "Kevin Hunt \u2013 Hapoalim Securities", "Yes, thank you. I just want to follow up on the distribution piece of your business, that you referred to earlier about the channel inventory. Looking at just the growth numbers that you reported in the terms of the mix and this is the fourth quarter in a row where you had fairly substantial better performance of your distribution relative to your OEM and your channel \u2013 I mean, I'm sorry, in your retail. And if I kind of just do some of math, it looks like pretty much all of the incremental units you shipped above your guidance level would have gone into the distribution piece of your business this quarter. ", "So just kind of what \u2013 and trying to tie that to your commentary that inventory is lower than it was last quarter and is there something going on there in terms of like the sell through dynamics of WD versus other players in the industry. That\u2019s it and I have another follow-up.", "John Coyne", "At the beginning of the quarter we did see a shortage of product in the distribution channel. Well, actually what we saw was a significant demand from the distribution channel in the early part of the quarter. We serviced that demand given our ability to mix rapidly into 3.5 inch. We weren't sure at the beginning of the quarter whether that was a (inaudible) statement being stronger than expectation or whether it was a competitive supply statement relative to the spotty supply chain. ", "It appears that it was a bit of both and then as we got closer to the end of the quarter, we got into March the overall demand strength was maintained but we saw competitive availability improve as we got towards the back half of the quarter. I don\u2019t know if that helped you.", "Kevin Hunt \u2013 Hapoalim Securities", "Okay. And my follow-up was just on the consumer piece where you had \u2013 it would seem seemed like again counter seasonal up growth there in that market and I think that was consistent with what Seagate said, and their DVR business as well. So is there something sort of changing in that business, is that sort of picking up or something? What can you tell us about that market?", "John Coyne", "Yes, we saw strength in that market both in OEM, which is essentially the DVR piece and in the channel, which tends to be more into the surveillance market and we saw lift in both of those markets.", "Kevin Hunt \u2013 Hapoalim Securities", "Is this economy recovery issue or is there something different going on there or what \u2013", "John Coyne", "Not a 100% sure, but I think it may be related to the recovery pace post recession and the different model there, where essentially that's a lease, large service providers buy the equipment and then the individual consumer essentially leases it over time in the DVR space. And so, yes, I think that DVR market is behaving more like commercial PC than consumer PC. So I think recovery has kind of got a little bit shifted to the right and has distorted seasonal patterns as a result.", "Operator", "Jason Nolan with Robert Baird. Your line is open.", "Jason Nolan \u2013 Robert Baird", "Yes, thank you. I wanted to go back to the competitive dynamics question, Hitachi had a very strong Q1, also there\u2019s a couple of other players out there. I guess in the past sometimes there's been oversupply if people get too optimistic but given the situation in the market today it seems unlikely anybody would be able to substantially oversupply the market, maybe John or Timothy could comment on that.", "Timothy Leyden", "Okay, yes, we were encouraged by Hitachi's results and we think it's the level of transparency they providing is a positive for the industry. And we also think that level of transparency will also be beneficial to the investment community as the behavior of the people now hold somewhere close to around 80% of the total market.

The first of those and the ones that we have five years experience in is the embedded market for industrial, aerospace, Netcom and so on.

So it\u2019s a \u2013 an overall business mix thing, plus my earlier comment about the smaller you are, the more appropriate and able you are to pick your products and cherry pick your overall business. ", "So \u2013 but I think a \u2013 a superb recovery story there that that just reinforces I think what we and Seagate have been saying to the investment community for several years now that with the proper business model with which at a scale of this opportunity today is a vertically integrated large scale, efficiently run manufacturing operation with measured marketing and failed activity that this is a highly desirable business. ", "And when we look at the opportunities and the level of content generation that\u2019s going on around us and the demand level for storage, this properly addressed, this is a fantastic business opportunity. ", "And I think the fact that Hitachi have now opened the Kimono and being more forthcoming with how they are running the business, I think the investment community should be a lot more prepared to give the HDD industry a little more of its due relative to its opportunity provide significant return on investment.", "Kaushik Roy \u2013 Wedbush", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Next question comes from Nahal Troksey with Technology Insight Research. Your line is open.", "Nahal Troksey \u2013 Technology Insight Research", "", "Yes, hi guys, a nice quarter. A little bit more of a longer-term question. Can you talk about indicates that supply does not meet demand in the second half, what do you believe is the risk that PP OEMs would mix towards SSDs? And then on the back of that, because you also talked about what you believe would be effect of ramp-up tablets on the hard drive industry?", "", "John Coyne", "", "I think the risk that they would some SSDs is very minimal for two reasons. One, NAND flash supply is going to be even tighter than the supply chain for the \u2013 for hard drives based on the success of highly mobile devices that absolutely have to have NAND flash to make them work. And that represents the vast bulk of the demand profile for NAND flash. And when you look at the level of investment that\u2019s been put in to the flash market, it will be very tight through the back half of the year we believe.", "Your follow-up relative \u2013 also NAND flash does not address the storage requirements of the vast bulk of those devices that traditionally use hard drives. If it did, I guess the only thing we would be selling is single head single platter. ", "So then on your tablet question, that makes it even more unlikely that there is going to be an SSD migration in the mainstream PC business, and we see tablets similar to net book that it will create yet another category of device which will initially consume created content which must be stored from where, which will drive requirements for near line storage, cloud support. And as we look at the specs of some of the prospective tablets that are coming along, they will also have content generation capability. And we see it all as positive addition to the total infrastructural demand that\u2019s going to drive our business into the future.", "Nahal Troksey \u2013 Technology Insight Research", "", "Okay. Can I ask a follow-on to that actually?", "John Coyne", "", "Sure.", "Nahal Troksey \u2013 Technology Insight Research", "", "So do you see an opportunity that you would be able to get in the hard drive within any of these tablet PCs?", "John Coyne", "Certainly, yes.", "Nahal Troksey \u2013 Technology Insight Research", "", "Does it require a slim line form factor, or can you do what the regular 2.5 inch form factor.", "John Coyne", "", "Probably both, but likely it will be slim line.", "Nahal Troksey \u2013 Technology Insight Research", "", "Okay, very good, thank you.", "John Coyne", "", "You\u2019re welcome. Okay, thank you all for joining us today. I look forward to keeping you informed of our progress in the quarters ahead. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Thank you.

Morgan", "Operator", "Good afternoon and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital\u2019s First Quarter Financial Results for fiscal year 2011. Presently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)", "As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now, I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.", "Bob Blair", "Thank you. I want to mention as we begin that we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning the role in growth of digital content, growth opportunities for storage companies and our responses there too, industry inventory, pricing and demand, our business model, our position in the industry, total available market for hard drives in the December quarter, our expected capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization and tax rate for fiscal 2011, our share repurchase plans, and our financial results, expectations for the December quarter, including revenue, expenses, tax rate, share count and earnings per share.", "These forward-looking statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-K filed with the SEC on August 13, 2010. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events and you should not assume later in the quarter that the comments we make today are still valid.", "I also want to note that copies of remarks from today\u2019s call will be available on the Investor section of Western Digital\u2019s website immediately following the conclusion of this call.", "I would now like to turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer of Western Digital, John Coyne.", "John Coyne", "Thank you, Bob. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. With me are Tim Leyden, recently named Chief Operating Officer; and Wolfgang Nickl, our newly appointed Chief Financial Officer. Although my titles of President and CEO are unchanged, my emphasis has shifted to how we can best leverage our resources to accelerate our growth in the years ahead.", "As the new leader of all WD operations and keeper of our low cost model, Tim will discuss current industry dynamics and the company\u2019s performance in the September quarter. While Wolfgang will report on our financial results and provide our outlook for the December quarter.", "With the advantage of the deeply experienced dedicated and passionate team we are excited as we lead WD into its fifth decade. As we look out over the next 10 years, the role of digital content in our daily lives at home and in the workplace will become increasingly ubiquitous with the explosion of data and video rich applications creating huge amounts of digital content that need to be stored and managed.", "This will be driven by both the traditional computing markets and by new or evolutionary platforms such as hand held devices, television and other home entertainment devices for the analog to digital conversion is in its infancy.", "In addition to the continuing growth of traditional PC platforms, the growth of cloud computing, tablet computing and the proliferation of smartphones creates myriad opportunities for storage companies and traditional hard drive and emerging solid state drive markets.", "We will shape the future of WD by sorting through all of these opportunities and acting decisively in our core business and in our business development efforts to continue delivering value to customers and shareholders. You have seen some early indications of one new strategic direction for WD into the movement of data and content around the home, with our WD TV Live HD Media Players, our WD My Book Live Network Storage Solutions and most recently our WD Livewire Powerline Network offering.", "Going forward, we are looking for ways in which to pursue strategic growth initiatives such as these both organically and through acquisition.", "Turning to the current hard drive industry environment, we are again reminded that this is a competitive industry of seasons and cycles. The management of supply and demand remains an imperfect science. The moderation and industry demand growth in the last two quarters came on the heels of an unprecedented four quarters of strong sequential growth coming out of the great recession.", "As an industry we purely overshot the recent market demand and we\u2019ve spent the last six months correcting for that. We believe this will prove to be an interlude to the resumption of the industries traditional cadence of growth over the last 10 years.", "Having said this, it\u2019s important to note that growth has not disappeared in the hard drive industry post-recession. Expected year-on-year volume growth and calendar year 2010 of 15% brings the five-year industry compound growth rate, which includes the recession of late 2008 to about 11%, while the average growth rate over the last 10 years has been 12.5%.", "In the last two quarters, some competitors have made aggressive bids to recover market share. This is a scenario we have seen play out from time-to-time over the years in the drive industry. Our observation is that these are temporary skirmishes, which do not derail our fundamental long-term profitable growth story as we address these challenges with a tested business model we have developed and honed overtime.", "For the last 10 years, WD has been navigating these industry swings and consistently winning share with our focus on customer value by having the lowest cost model in the industry. We have grown revenues by 18% annually over the past 10 years and by 22% annually for the past five years, by providing exceptional value to our customers through the high quality, reliability and desirability of our products along with predictable availability and competitive prices.", "At the same time, we have expanded our full year gross margins from 11% in 2001 to 24% in 2010. This was accomplished primarily through successful vertical integration, expanding our product breath, delighting our customers and execution of our low cost model. We will continue with this approach as we go forward.", "Tim Leyden will now comment on how the September quarter played out for WD and the industry.", "Tim Leyden", "Thank you. As John indicated we have navigated through most of the market driven supply demand imbalances in the hard drive industry and WD remains prepared to address them with what we believe is the industry\u2019s lowest cost market.", "Continuing our unwavering focus on low cost leadership is my top priority in my new position. Encompass with a focus on staying on the industry area inventory curve and continued depreciation of customer needs and a broad and diverse set of competitive product offerings in all segments will keep us in an advantage position. This proven approach to the hard drive business has served us, our customers and our shareholders well over the last 10 years.", "As John mentioned earlier, we saw an increase into four consecutive quarters of increasing hard drive shipments from April 2009 to March 2010 and it is now apparent that we have been experiencing correction of PC maker inventories beginning in the June quarter of this year. Despite weak demand for the first two months of the September quarter and a quieter than normal back-to-school season, industry shipments nevertheless climb towards the high-end of our 165 million unit forecast for the September quarter. But to accomplish this, shipment volumes in week 13 were over twice the average of previous weeks.", "In light of the sluggish demand in July and August, we reduced our bill plans for September, delayed our capital spending and selectively stepped back from participating in some very aggressive pricing at the end of the quarter.", "Lower than expected demand early in the quarter led to a buildup of manufactures inventory during the first eight weeks of quarter and contrary to prior fiscal first quarter historical trends, it contributed to aggressive pricing during the remainder of the quarter.", "We maintain shares in the 3.5-inch market and uses 1.5 points per share in 2.5-inch as a result of our temporary pullback. We exited the quarter with well controlled inventories in each of our segments. We expect that the instrumental parts of the week 13 shipments will be consumed during the current quarter because customers will not wish to carry this inventory into a seasonally weaker March quarter and we believe this set the stage for a TAM in the December quarter that will be essentially flat with the September quarter.", "We believe that HDD hardware and software are pivotal to the data and content management infrastructure ecosystem. The value delivered is not proportional to your reward in the broader marketplace. Particularly in the level of unique skills and investments in technology and capital are taken into consideration.", "Consequently, we are in the midst of reviewing the comparative returns on investments that we are currently achieving across our customer and product ranges, with a view to reaching the levels of ROI we need in order to continue investing and provide a product availability that the market demands.", "As the industry\u2019s low cost provider, we believe that it is in the best interest of our customers and shareholders that we offer products at a price that cover the cost of doing business and provides the margin and the funding required to continue investing in all that remain a valued HDD supplier on a long-term sustainable basis.", "Looking at our third markets in the September quarter, in the compute space we saw continuation of softness in consumer demand in all channels, with somewhat of an offset coming from healthier desktops and commercial notebook demand. We expect desktop demand to be marginally down and notebook demand to be marginally up in the December quarter.", "In the enterprise segment, we saw continued demand strength particularly in enterprise data with the traditional enterprise segment been essentially flat sequentially. We expect overall enterprise demand to show us some modest growth in the December quarter.", "In a non-compute space, we saw the CE market volumes decline marginally quarter-on-quarter as the market try to start a seasonal demand pattern. At the same time the branded products market showed seasonal demand strength for both 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch categories showing growth.", "We expect the non-compute space to be essentially flat in the December quarter. I can see volume increases in branded and CE are offset by the seasonal decline in gaining volume. Geographically, Asia has showed continued strength, Europe showed the best comparative improvement from the previous quarter helped by the currency appreciation, while the U.S. market is up modestly from the prior quarter.", "We shipped 50.7 million units in the September quarter up 15% from the year ago period, while the overall market grew by 8%. Revenues totaled $2.4 billion, gross margin was 18.2%, we remain solidly profitable with net income of $197 million. Importantly, we continue to generate strong cash flow from operations of $390 million.", "We continue to invest in the business and are doing so by improving and expanding our operations and by enhancing our product line up, both in our industry leading hard drive offerings and in the nascent the promising market for management of content in the home.", "In our traditional businesses, we deliver new models of our popular My Book and My Passport external hard drives with USB 3 connectivity and up to the 3 terabytes of storage. Significantly improving content transfer speed and providing our customers with future proofing as newer PCs and other devices begin shipping in volume with USB 3.", "And in the component space we began shipping the highest area of entity 3.5-inch hard drive in the industry. The WD Caviar Green 3 terabytes which fits 750 gigabytes on each of its forefathers, reflecting our increasing focus on enabling a comprehensive and easy-to-use experience for management of content in the home, we have added several new products and features, including the WD Livewire Powerline AV Network Kit, a home AV compatible solution that enables consumers to use their existing electrical wiring for extent secure high-speed internet connection throughout the home.", "My Book Live Home Network Drive which gives consumers the fastest storage of and access to their content and provide a seamless set up centralizing digital media in the home. The 1 terabyte WD Elements Play Multimedia Drives with high-definition capability onboard and we also recently introduced the newest version of WD Photos, a photo viewer application now optimized for the iPad, the iPhone 4 and iPod touch. WD Photos enables users to use photos stored on their WD Home Network Drive from any location.", "I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang Nickl for view of our Q1 financial performance and our outlook for the second quarter.", "Wolfgang Nickl", "Thank you, Tim. I would like to refer you to a new and expanded summary of financial information that been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. Much of the data that we have re-sited during past conference calls is included in that spreadsheet.", "During my prepared remarks, I will focus on highlights and significant changes in some of our key metrics. At the end of this call the summary of financial information will be updated to include our Q2 guidance which I will discuss in a few moments.", "The September quarter was characterized by unusually aggressive pricing that lasted throughout the quarter, with like-to-like prices decline in excess of 8%. Pricing pressure was most prevalent in the 2.5-inch segment. We made a conscious decision to limit our participation in this segment in an effort to optimize profitability. Our operating model allowed us to adjust our operating expenses to offset the impact of pricing on operating markets, in close the quarter near the midpoint of our EPS guidance range.", "We actively managed capital receipts and working capital and generated significant free cash flow. Revenues for the first fiscal quarter were $2.4 billion, up 9% from the prior year and 1% sequentially. This included $51 million of sales of media from our newly acquired Singapore media facility to fulfill contractual obligations carrying over from poised existing sales commitment.", "We do not expect any external media sales in Q2. Our price shipments totaled 50.7 million units, up 15% from the prior year period and 2% sequentially. Revenue from sales of WD TV Media Players, WD Livewire, Network Kits and solid state drive totaled approximately $33 million. Roughly flat with the prior year and up 22% from the June quarter.", "Average hard drive selling price was approximately $46 per unit, down $3 from the year ago quarter and down $1 from the June quarter. Revenue from sales of our branded products including WD TV and WD Livewire products were $425 million, up 11% from $382 million in the year ago quarter and 6% sequentially from $400 million in the June quarter. There was no customer that comprised 10% or more of our total revenue.", "Our first margin for the quarter was 18.2%, down from 23.3% in the year ago quarter and down from 22.5% in the June quarter. The lower and expected gross margin percentage was prematurely due to the price decline, I spoke to you earlier. Product and segment mix as well as product cost decline were largely in line with expectations.", "Total R&D and SG&A spending was $226 million or 9.4% of revenue. This compares with $195 million or 8.8% of revenue in the year ago quarter and $242 million or 10.2% of revenue in the June quarter. As a reminder, total operating expenses for the June quarter include a $27 million of litigation settlement.", "Operating income was $211 million or 8.8% of revenue. This compares with $319 million or 14.4% of revenue in the year ago quarter and $293 million or 12.3% of revenue in the June quarter.", "Net interest and other non-operating expenses were less than $1 million. Tax expense for the September quarter was $14 million or 6.6% of the pre-tax income. Our net incomes totaled $197 million or $0.84 per share. This compares with $288 million or $1.25 per share and $265 million or $1.13 per share in the year ago and June quarter\u2019s, respectively.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we generated $390 million in cash flow from operations during the September quarter. Our cash conversion cycle for the first quarter was a negative three-day. It consisted of 50 days of residual outstanding, 26 days of inventory or 14 turns and 79 days of payables.", "Capital additions for the September quarter totaled $200 million, lower than our July projections of $275 million as we scale back in line with lower shipments. Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter totaled $150 million.", "We continue to expect our capital expenditure for fiscal 2011 to be between 7% and 8% of revenue with an additional $200 million related to our 6-inch to 8-inch wafer conversion and some expenditure to optimize the output from our recently acquired media facility in Singapore. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be at about $630 million for the fiscal year.", "We made $25 million of debt repayment installments during the first quarter and thereby reduced our debt balance to $375 million. We exited fiscal Q1 with cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 billion, an increase of $124 million from the June quarter.", "During the quarter we repurchased 1.8 million shares at a total cost of $60 million. The balance remaining on our stock repurchase authorization is $460 million. From a balance sheet credit perspective our first priority is to create shareholder value through strategic investments both in markets currently served and adjacent markets. Any larger scale share buyback would be considered only after we have started our strategic option.", "Now turning to our expectations for Q2. Historically, industry shipment increased by 5% to 7% from the September through the December quarter. As Tim mentioned, we have seen approximately twice the shipments volume in the last week of last quarter than in average of the preceding 12 weeks of the quarter.", "We believe that customers will not want to carry extra inventory into the March quarter and therefore expect some inventory correction. We consequently assume that the December quarter industry TAM will be roughly flat with the September quarter at around 165 million units.", "Some of the aggressive pricing we have seen last quarter has carried over into this quarter and our guidance includes like-to-like price decline of approximately 5%. We are actively reviewing our plan shipment portfolio to identify business that is not meeting our business model requirements.", "We have contractual obligations do not exist we may review our shipments to low contribution products and seek to ship sales to more profitable segments. As previously indicated, we are currently calibrating our new Singapore media facility to our own recipes and as a result, we are experiencing dilution of first margin of 50 basis points during this quarter.", "Accordingly, our guidance for fiscal Q2 is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range from $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion. R&D and SG&A spending is expected to total approximately $230 million. Our net interest expense is projected to be about $1 million, expect our tax rate to be within our business model of 6% to 9%. We anticipate our share count to be approximately 235 million. We estimate earnings per share of between $0.50 and $0.60 for the December quarter.", "Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. Your line is open.", "Rich Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company", "Thank you. Good afternoon. A few questions. I guess, first, regarding the 13th week extra shipments that you are referring to, did those shipments go to OEMs or did they go to the channel? Any color on the types of products lines we\u2019re really talking about?", "John Coyne", "Hi, Rich. Those shipments went mainly to OEM.", "Rich Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company", "Okay. With a desktop or notebook?", "John Coyne", "Mainly notebook because notebook is as you know has got a heavy OEM level.", "Rich Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company", "Okay. And then, in terms of the raw materials and Tim this is probably best for you. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen the news about the raw materials, the rare earth metals coming out of China. Do you have any thoughts on serum shortages affecting the substrate world and are you protected against that because of the Hoya relationship, any comments?", "Tim Leyden", "We don\u2019t really have much insight into that at this particular point, Richard. And but we are looking at how it might impact us and we\u2019ve got pretty good relationships with our vendors, so we are looking to leverage those and I\u2019ll make sure that we are minimally impacted.", "Rich Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company", "Okay. Then, just lastly, traditionally the industry has been able to offset price declines by moving to new product lines. There has been largely in absence of new products here in the second half of calendar \u201810. There supposed to be some new products coming out in the first half of \u201811, do you think that that\u2019s the opportunity to go and maybe reset this cost price situation or any thought that we might be able to see a stabilization of the praising environment?", "Tim Leyden", "What we have seen previously from history is that the stabilization of the pricing environment comes when demand exceeds supply and that has generally been going through seasonal cadences, generally been in the September and December quarter.", "And so with the working off the inventory that has occurred during the course of the September quarter and with the HDD market being up about 5% versus what would normally be a much stronger position, somewhere in the 10% to 12% I would imagine.", "And going into a December quarter that\u2019s essentially flat we think that the opportunity will come more from supply, demand \u2013 in supply case and demand again. So we think that it will and the industry will have to manage the inventory supply demand equilibrium and stabilize that situation and that will have more of an impact on us than any of the new products exception.", "Rich Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Aaron Rakers with Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Yeah. Thanks guys. So just a backwards math given what you guys just said about the guidance, it would appear to me that you\u2019re guiding a gross margin number somewhere that 60% range. So, I think, in the context of pricing, in the context of the TAM assumption. If I\u2019m correct, can you help me bridge the gap on top of that 50 basis point impact from kind of ramping the Hoya facility and then I have a follow-up?", "Wolfgang Nickl", "Yeah. Aaron, this is Wolfgang. Your math is obviously correct. Gross margin is a function of business segment mix cost declines and price declines. And the 5% like-to-like price decline that I quoted compares to a regular price decline in this quarter, historically that we have seen in the 1.5% to 2% range and I would say this is the main contributor to the decline quarter-over-quarter.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "And then the follow-up questions, first of all, on the $27 million of litigation expense, are you assuming that that continues here going forward. And finally, I appreciate the more detailed breakdown that you guys are giving, actually breaking out an enterprise shipment number. Is that inclusive of both SATA and SAS drive into enterprise? I\u2019m just trying to understand maybe the ramp in the traditional enterprise that you guys are seeing when we might be able to point to kind of inflection point some appreciable market share gains there? Thank you.", "Tim Leyden", "Yeah. Aaron, I think the enterprise question, yeah, that\u2019s correct, the enterprise number would be comprised of all of our enterprise shipments, including traditional and our products and I\u2019ll let John speak the litigation question.", "John Coyne", "Yeah. The litigation is a one-off.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. So with $27 million out, why is the expense than on a normalized basis going up?", "Wolfgang Nickl", "The expense going up if you take the $242 from the June quarter and normalize all the $27 and then the increase in expense comes mainly from an adjustment in our incentive growth and then from investments in our research and development teams and in our sales teams to increase our market reach.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank, your line is open.", "Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hi. Thank you. I was curious if you would want to make comments on the recent news that Seagate announced that they might be going private and would it be something that you guys would consider doing?", "John Coyne", "Hi, Sherri. This is John. We\u2019ve seen Seagate as a formidable and respected competitor both in public and private ownership previously. And so we have no reason to believe that that will change whether they are public or private. They will remain a respected and formidable competitor.", "Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Is that something you would consider doing if they were private?", "John Coyne", "We don\u2019t think the ownership structure is significant. The business model is what we are focused on. And we believe our business model that we\u2019ve been refining for the last 10 years is the appropriate one for its effect in the market.", "Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then in terms of the gross margin now being down below your targeted range, we\u2019re heading into -- after December, we are into the margin that June quarters went and due to its demand, it\u2019s typically down. I am trying to get a sense of how long do you think it will take before we get back into your targeted ranges for gross margins. It seems like that won\u2019t happen until the second half of 2011 at the earliest?", "Wolfgang Nickl", "Wolfgang again. As I mentioned, price decline is a very important contributor to this equation. We\u2019re in control of our cost declines and we are working on our channel mix. So it will come down to win the supply demand situation and will allow pricing to stabilize. And we are not making any predictions when that would happen but we know that the margins for the June quarter usually are seasonally soft.", "Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Do you -- I guess, just quickly do you have any sense of what the industry capacity is right now? Would you say that it\u2019s 10% higher than the TAM or 20% higher than the TAM? Just trying to get a sense.", "Wolfgang Nickl", "We are just going on with what expectations are like to say as things coming into the year. There was expectations that the industry demand would be somewhere in the 170 million units or 180 million units, that type of number. And so consequently we\u2019re a running at about 165 and if you take the midpoint of the 170 to 180 million units, you are probably looking at being somewhere between 90 and 95%. You just take the straight map 165 to 175, it\u2019s about 94%. So you\u2019re probably somewhere in there 90 to 95% range.", "Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal, your line is open.", "Keith Bachman \u2013 Bank of Montreal", "Hi. Tim. I guess this is for you. On the TAM, I just want to make sure I am doing the numbers right. It sounds like September came in kind of 164 million and normally, I think you indicated that the bump in units would be three to 5%, so maybe it\u2019s a low 170 million. So does that suggest that that map that you have about seven to 8 million units out there as the extra inventory that needs to get worked of?", "Tim Leyden", "Yeah. Probably it\u2019s right around that number, maybe marginally higher than that.", "Keith Bachman \u2013 Bank of Montreal", "Okay. And is it -- I think you said it was more notebooks but what is it collective so to speak? I know you guys said you elected not to participate but were there many fingerprints on the drives?", "Tim Leyden", "We didn\u2019t actually mention that we elected not to participate. We mentioned that we selectively set back. So in addition to that you know, even though it is a higher number than what we would normally see, there is always some extra amount that gets shift in at the end of each quarter. So the excess over and above, what would normally happen is probably somewhere in the region of about 5 million units or so. And so that has to get worked off obviously going into a quarter which is front-ended loaded as oppose to the previous two quarters, which have been heavily back-end loaded. And so there is an opportunity for that inventory to get burned off early. We\u2019ll just have to wait to see what happens.", "Keith Bachman \u2013 Bank of Montreal", "Okay. Well, then my follow-up then Tim is just curious, your discussions with the OEMs as it relates to the demand on the notebook side versus the potential conflict or demand conflict with tablets. How are the OEMs characterizing and how does that make you think about the seasonality in notebook drives in the March quarter? And that\u2019s it from me. Thanks.", "John Coyne", "This is John. I will take this tablet question. You know, from everything we can gather with multiple different source reporting on, on tablets, I mean we see the first two quarters of the iPad had about 8 million units.", "Keith Bachman \u2013 Bank of Montreal", "Right.", "John Coyne", "Compares -- to, to put it in context, that compares with the first two quarters of the EPC netbook emergence, which was 5 million in its first, first two quarters? So everything we hear indicates that roughly half of the iPad sales are to existing Apple households and that somewhere in the region of 13% to 15% of the folks buying iPads admit to substituting the iPad for a previously planned PC purchase and some 23% of purchasers indicate that they are buying an iPad as an alternative to a Kindle or other eReader. So, what we see, I think, is a complementary additional device sale to the overall ecosystem of content consumption.", "We think that when you look at the numbers, certainly there has been some fall off in netbook over the last couple quarters. They\u2019re also -- you have to take the price point of the iPad into account. It\u2019s likely that over the next several quarters as other tablets emerge, they will address lower price points than the iPad currently occupies. But on overall assessment, we\u2019re seeing, maybe somewhere in the 10% to 20% impact range on the growth of low end notebook/netbook products.", "Keith Bachman \u2013 Bank of Montreal", "Okay. Fair enough. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital, your line is open.", "Ben Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Hi. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about going beyond the December quarter, if you could, just about some dynamics that are setting up. There\u2019s Intel\u2019s Sandy Bridge, which may affect some of the builds from OEM customers and then there is the emergence of China, which is kind of changing the seasonality of the whole world. So is there a chance that TAM is, is flattish like it was again, you know, like it was last year in the March quarter? And is, is -- does the March quarter potentially represents some light at the end of the tunnel here after this big quarter of adjustment in December?", "Tim Leyden", "Yeah. I think there is a chance. I mean, March quarter traditionally, if we go back to the more pre-recession cadence, was flat to slightly down, somewhere in the 3% region. And from a going forward seasonal viewpoint, it does look as if the strength of China is changing that dynamic. So there is opportunity there for the -- for the situation to improve. So we\u2019ll wait and see but, I mean, there is -- it\u2019s all dependent on the working through the inventory that the PC -- that the OEMs have, the PC OEM\u2019s have built up and how they manage that and then how the different fares in the disk drive industry and manage the shipments going into the market.", "So there is a lot of dynamics on it. But the -- but there is an opportunity considering the changing variables that are going in such as the Intel Sandy Bridge, the Chinese New Year and the strength of post-Christmas sales as well. So there is opportunity and we will have to wait and see.", "Ben Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. And then I wanted to just address the demand issue again, perhaps with Apple having an event tomorrow where they might introduce more NAND into the MacBook Air and what not. Just -- is there, is there, has there anything changed more in the mainstream PC market or is there any worries about what Apple may do actually more the mainstream PC market with NAND? Or is that a status quo still right now, where it\u2019s too expensive and it\u2019s not going to happen and it\u2019s just going to be in the iPad market or the tablet market?", "John Coyne", "Yeah. We believe that the solid-state solutions are not competitive in the mainstream PC market, whether laptop or desktop, the economics just don\u2019t work out. Where the storage element is constrained by form factor than on high price point devices, solid state is an appropriate solution. And where, in the very small form factor devices, like PDAs and MP3 players and so on, it\u2019s clear that small amounts of solid-state memory are the solution to fit in the form factor and fit in the budget.", "Ben Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Nehal Chokshi with Technology Insights Research, your line is open.", "Nehal Chokshi \u2013 Technology Insights Research", "Yeah. I got two questions actually. Your enterprise units are down Q2 compared to what is typically and up Q. Can you talk about what drove that?", "John Coyne", "Yeah. We are going through some product transitions in there. We had a very strong product lineup and we are now moving into a period in which we would have some product transitions. We expect to work through those in two or three quarters.", "Nehal Chokshi \u2013 Technology Insights Research", "Okay. Is that a SAT space transition or is that a base transition?", "John Coyne", "It\u2019s a SATA base transition.", "Nehal Chokshi \u2013 Technology Insights Research", "Okay. All right. And then at the beginning of the call, John, you talked about how you\u2019re putting a little bit larger focus on some strategic direction. It seems like you\u2019re trying to talk about more focus on the users that implies greater focus on software. Can you discuss some metrics that verify that this is being the case, possibly maybe number of software engineers at WD, how that\u2019s growing or maybe R&D spend dedicated software. Can you talk a little bit to that?", "John Coyne", "I\u2019ll not give you specifics on that for competitive reasons but I -- if you look at the thrust of our product offerings in our branded business, you\u2019ll note that we have \u2013 we\u2019ve migrated the backup software on all of our drive products, the MyBook and My Passport lines, which used to be a purchase software solution, we have migrated to an internally developed solution so that we can better own the total customer experience there and the interaction of the customer with the device.", "If you look at our complete range of WD media players, the TV Live line and the Elements Play line, there again you will see significant software content in those products. And then you look at the -- our recent launch of the WD photo app for the iPad, iPhone 4 and iPod Touch, again an in-house developed software product. So, also some years ago, you recall we bought a company called [Meomat], which was a software play that we have developed into the major engine that creates the connectivity and accessibility for all of our products as the interplay for remote access. So, yeah, we are putting significant emphasis on software these days.", "Nehal Chokshi \u2013 Technology Insights Research", "Okay. Thank you for that.", "Operator", "Rob Cihra with Caris & Company, your line is open.", "Rob Cihra \u2013 Caris & Company", "Hi, thanks very much. Two questions, if I could. One, just on CapEx. It did come in a little lower in dollar terms and you had mentioned that you are still looking at the same target as a percentage of revenue and including the eight-inch wafer conversion. But can you, can you tell us what you\u2019ve seen, maybe from sort of across the industry in terms of other players? If you\u2019re seeing people already cutting CapEx measurably or just starting to a little bit including for example, Asian media suppliers. Do you think that\u2019s going to help anytime soon or are we too early for CapEx cuts to help?", "And then separate from that, if I could just push maybe a little more, you did touch on the almost the $11 in cash per share that you have. I am just wondering if you could push a little more in terms of what your priorities are in terms of buyback versus potential dividend versus acquisitions? Thank you.", "John Coyne", "Okay. From a CapEx viewpoint, we don\u2019t really have much in for competitors or we would imagine that by past history that people are -- since the volumes are coming in lower than what people had anticipated in September and December quarters, if our projections for \u201810 being flattish from September is correct. We would imagine that everybody is moving to postpone and cancel where possible and capital editions and managing it as prudently as they possibly can. In our case, we are -- we have demonstrated that capability over long period of time. We add capacity just in time and we have managed the capacity on an ongoing basis in order to cover the demand at that point in time.", "Tim Leyden", "In terms of the balance sheet and stuff, we built a strategy, as John mentioned in his remarks, our prime focus right now is to evaluate strategic opportunities both in the HED as well as in adjacent markets. And we will use our cash and our borrowing capacity to accomplish that. And once we have previewed all of these opportunities and solution that we can find anything appropriate, we will evaluate the best way of returning money to the shareholder and that could be in home or share buyback. And we will decide whether we do that in a unlevered or a levered fashion at the appropriate point in time.", "Rob Cihra \u2013 Caris & Company", "All right. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Mark Miller with Noble Financial, your line is open.", "Mark Miller \u2013 Noble Financial", "I want to go back and talk about pricing again because these margins were, I think, below most -- what most people thought you indicate in inventory. How much -- you are roughly split 50/50 between the OEM and channel and retail. How much of the pricing pressure or the decrease margins is due to pricing from the OEM options? And how much of it is your anticipated pricing pressures in the channel?", "Tim Leyden", "I think there will be more pricing pressure coming from OEMs because during the four quarters of unprecedented demand outstripping supply, the OEMs got nervous about supply -- built up some inventory positions within their, their own internal inventory. And then we came on a little consumer softness, they let the inventory correct and then sat back and got some improved pricing conditions as a result of that.", "And, so that dynamic is, is the more important one in the overall pricing movement. There has been some pressure in the channel as well as in the last couple of quarters we\u2019ve had different competitors trying to gain back market shares that they had lost in earlier quarters. And it\u2019s put some pressure on the channel but I think the OEM pricing pressure has been more significant.", "Mark Miller \u2013 Noble Financial", "Okay. Just one final question. You are going through a major ramp in your HID fabs and also I think expanding into a new fab in the old Thermoway facility. Have you had to buy more components externally then you have in previous quarters or you are still supplying at roughly the same mix internally and externally, especially for HIDs and as well as media, by the way?", "Tim Leyden", "Yeah. I mean we have a very good relationships with the external merchant vendors. And we\u2019ve got our own internal components operating rather well. So we operate in order to -- we mix both in order to optimize the power profit objective. And that fluctuates around, you know, from somewhere around 75% to 85% internal. And so we continue to work that, that\u2019s not a, a perfect science as you can imagine. So, it\u2019s -- we are continuing to work it as we always do.", "Mark Miller \u2013 Noble Financial", "So there is no major, no change in your mix? Just relatively small change in your mix between internal and external component supply expected for the December quarter as what you\u2019ve seen in the recent quarters?", "Tim Leyden", "No.", "Mark Miller \u2013 Noble Financial", "Thank you.", "Tim Leyden", "Other than, of course, the impact of the Singapore Hoya facility that will change the dynamic and increase the internal for media.", "Mark Miller \u2013 Noble Financial", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Kaushik Roy with Wedbush, your line is open.", "Kaushik Roy \u2013 Wedbush", "Thanks. So going back to the question of Seagate, how do you see the markets evolving if Seagate goes private? I mean, do you expect less pricing pressure or not really?", "John Coyne", "Based on history, we don\u2019t perceive that private or public ownership had any significant impact on how Seagate addressed the market and how we addressed the market. So we\u2019re -- I mean we\u2019re focused on how we continue to find a recipe that delights customers and does so based off having the lowest costs in the industry so that we can convert that customer delight, despite competitive environment into significant profitability and growth. And so we don\u2019t see the company ownership fees as a significant -- very significant element in all of that.", "Kaushik Roy \u2013 Wedbush", "And then you said that SSDs are not competitive on desktop and notebook, but can you comment on your progress on SSDs? Are you willing to participate in the enterprise segment, or the small form factor segment? Thank you.", "John Coyne", "Yeah. We are -- the company we acquired a couple of years ago, we have worked on that embedded market for Netcom and industrial controls and so on and we have grown that business since acquisition. We are committed to that space. We have produced products for the client space that is very low volume.", "And we are working diligently on product for the enterprise space, which we believe is the most attractive application for solid-state drives, attractive to the customer because of the value it brings, attractive to us because of the value that we bring to the knowledge in the area of applications and management of media. And so that is our primary focus for now is on the development trail to broaden our enterprise portfolio offering.", "Kaushik Roy \u2013 Wedbush", "Can you quantify the units or revenues in any way?", "John Coyne", "We think that the enterprise, solid-state enterprise market today is somewhere in the $800 million to $1 billion range. And as we assess the various forecasts that are out there for multiple sources and our own take on that, you know, we are looking at that market as being a $3 to $5 billion market in three to five years.", "Kaushik Roy \u2013 Wedbush", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray, your line is open.", "Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Murray", "Thank you for taking the question. Hi, John, just wanted to ask your opinion on -- given that after this quarter, sounds like there\u2019s still going to be, I don\u2019t know, you say seven to 10 million drives of excess inventory out there for the industry. Might it, might it be, I guess, more prudent to ship, I guess, sort of a TAM down the December quarter versus September just to get that out of the way more quickly or is there something structural just about the way, you know, that you take down -- the industry collectively takes down the bill price of the quarter that precludes that from being done?", "Tim Leyden", "You know, our take on the TAM and calling the TAM flat quarter to quarter here, we believe the underlying demand is up quarter to quarter. We think there\u2019s -- it is seasonal and will likely be up in the 5% range on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And we\u2019re, we\u2019re calling the drive industry TAM flat so that the inventory that has been built up can be absorbed the market demand.", "Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Murray", "Got it. Thanks. And I guess just a quick follow-up on that. Any sense -- is it too early to get a sense -- if taking out, you know, through the inventory that will be taken out during the December quarter by shipping the flat TAM, will that make a meaningful difference in the promotion of, you know, more normal seasonal pricing in the March quarter?", "Tim Leyden", "I think March quarter, you know, the thesis is yet to be proven. But we do believe that there is some shift to the overall traditional seasonality of the industry and unfortunately the timing of the big recession makes it -- and the recovery out of that -- makes it very difficult to clearly discern shifts in the multi-year seasonal patterns. But we do believe that there is a (inaudible) of the rise of China as an important market, creating demand in the first calendar quarter of the year.", "We believe there is a shift from air freight to sea freight from Asia to the U.S. and Europe causing a shift, a pull forward of back to school builds into the second calendar quarter of the year. And that we\u2019re, over time, the seasonality of the business will flatten out. But it\u2019s, it\u2019s difficult to get a precise handle on that because of the massive disruption that the recession put on top of those patterns.", "Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Murray", "Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "Mark Moskowitz with J.P. Morgan, your line is open.", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Yeah. Thank you. Good afternoon. Two questions if I could. I want to come back to just what has been going on here over the past six months or so. John and Tim, if you could kind of weigh in here. Is there something that\u2019s structurally wrong right now with the overall disk drive industry in terms of how the industry interfaces with both the OEMs and the distributors?", "And I think back to 2004 how there was a lot of challenges and the industry participants worked to have greater transparency and greater dialogue to manage the inventories and supply demand and balances. Because I just get confused when you can have this huge 13th week and then suddenly the spigot gets turned off again by the OEMs. I mean, are they having these quick solid demand cycles? Who\u2019s kind of at fault here in terms of what is going on?", "John Coyne", "I mean, what you\u2019re seeing is competitive behavior in a slightly -- just slightly unbalanced supply demand situation. It is very typical. We saw -- we have never before seen in the industry four sequential quarters where the demand presented to the industry outstripped the industry\u2019s demand for supply -- ability to supply. And it\u2019s pretty natural coming out of that that the pendulum is going to swing back a little the other way. It is very difficult to land without a little over shoot.", "And so I think what you have seen in the last six months has been, you know, the wealth created in the four quarter runoff allowed people to -- encourage everybody to get more invested in the industry. And initially, as the demand softened, people have tried to maintain their momentum. And it takes a little while for folks to realize that the -- if everybody overbuilds then there\u2019s going to be pressure and then there is going to be -- you know, our customers are smart people. They are going to take advantage of that. And we need to get things back in balance and move on with life. And that is the cycle that has been played through.", "I think if you analyze the numbers however, you will see that -- you know things are not a disaster right now. Where we finished last quarter above the bottom of our model, you can go back many years into the last 10 years and find periods where we dropped out of the model for periods of time. And I would remind you that the model was a significantly lower bottom to it that it has today.", "So the industry and WD have expanded gross margin model consistently over the last 10 years. And we are still -- you know, yeah, we do not like being under the bottom of the model. And we are going to work to move ourselves back into it as soon as we can but we are also going to work to ensure that we have the right product set and the right availability and the right approach with our customers to have them prefer WD product over others and continue to grow our business profitably.", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "I guess as a follow-up then, so should, should the message be then to investors that we could see a Bell curve where you had four kind of medioric quarters and now you\u2019re going to have four quarters of some pretty challenging times? And I say that because if I think about the industry, to the industry\u2019s credit, you have a lot more efficient and effective participants now than we did say five years or six years ago. And as Rich alluded to earlier, it is going to difficult to kind of reset the price curve, I think, for the time being. So are we\u2026", "John Coyne", "What I would say to investors is to look at the long-term demand for storage. The fact that the most appropriate solution for mass volume storage is hard drives. And to look at the long-term progress the industry has made in the last 10 years and I believe we will continue on that fundamental trend line over the next 10 years.", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay.", "John Coyne", "So, in closing, I\u2019d like to thank all of you for joining us today. We appreciate your questions and your interest in the company and in the industry. We look forward to seeing you again in another quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jay Iyer, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Elizabeth, and good afternoon. Joining us on the call today are Dr. Eli Harari, Chairman and CEO of SanDisk; Sanjay Mehrotra, President and COO; and Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President of Administration and CFO.", "Before we begin, please note that any non-GAAP financial measures discussed during this call as defined by the SEC in Regulation G will be reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. That reconciliation is now available along with supplemental schedules on our website at sandisk.com/ir.", "In addition, during our call today, we will make forward-looking statements. Any statement that refers to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events, including financial projections and future market conditions is a forward-looking statement. Actual results may materially differ from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.", "For more information, please refer to the Risk Factors discussed in the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2009 and our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. SanDisk assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, which speak as of the date hereof.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Eli.", "Eli Harari", "This is the last quarterly call that I will address you as SanDisk Chairman and CEO. Therefore, rather than discussing our business in the third and fourth quarter, allow me to take this opportunity to review our most recent past and where I see our opportunities and challenges in the coming years. Sanjay and Judy will discuss our Q3 results and our expectations for Q4.", "In the past three years, we experienced the industry\u2019s most severe downturn followed by a strong recovery. We experienced six consecutive weak quarters generating a substantial operating loss, followed by six consecutive quarters of remarkable recovery. The current recovery continues even in the face of adverse macroeconomic in the US, much of Europe and Japan.", "For SanDisk, our cumulative non-GAAP operating profit for the six quarters ending this year will be more than 2.5 times greater than the cumulative non-GAAP operating loss in the preceding six quarters.", "We believe our industry is driven by several powerful secular trends that point to sustainable profitable growth for us in the coming years. First, in the more developed economies growth for us continues to be driven by the phenomenal rise of the mobile internet and social networks that fuel the surging demand for mobile devices such as Smartphones and tablets that in turn drive strong demand for flash memory.", "The second major secular force is the surging consumer middle class in emerging countries such as China, India, Latin America, Middle East and Africa. We are directing substantial resources to expand our businesses in these emerging countries and in the coming years we are encouraged by our gains to-date.", "The past downturn has taught the industry that even relatively small imbalances, either up or down, between demand and supply can disproportionately amplify market volatility. I have often said that the NAND industry is self-correcting and in the current recovery the industry did an excellent job of adjusting to compensate for the excessive CapEx investments that were made in the 2005 through 2008 timeframe.", "Industry cycles are a fact of life in our business and even severe downturns are in fact quite manageable provided you have solid balance sheet competitive technology and manufacturing base and diversified sales channels so that you\u2019re not overly reliant on any single channel or any single local economy.", "New fab capacity decisions are made 18 months ahead of production and even under best laid plans it is now easy to achieve and maintain a healthy balance. Some products such as the iPhone, the iPad and the Kindle come out of nowhere and very quickly enter hockey stick growth trajectory that creates a whole new market category while other products such as solid state drives, SSD, can take much longer to develop. Our focus at SanDisk has been and will continue to be long-term value creation but we do our best to balance growth with profitability and cash flow.", "Turning now to flash technology. NAND flash has confounded many skeptics as it marches with confidences to mass production at a 24 through 27-nanometer technology node, a fact that seemed iffy to manage just two years ago. An important element in the success of this rapid scaling has been the all but mandatory adoption of managed NAND requiring sophisticated controllers to compensate for deteriorating [raw] NAND reliability and performance.", "This is amply demonstrated for 3-bits per cell X3 NAND where the market is witnessing a wide variability in performance and reliability between the X3 product from different NAND suppliers. I believe that SanDisk is uniquely well-positioned in this space because from day 1 we stayed true to delivering system flash and managed NAND solutions and this is our third generation X3 in production where we have optimized our chip designs and perfected our controllers to deliver a solid solution.", "We now expect NAND to scale down to below 20 nanometers in the next few years. This will likely be achieved with existing lithography tools running in existing and new advanced NAND fab and this bodes well for our Yokkaichi fab as they become more fully depreciated in the coming years.", "As we push the roadmap even further, extreme ultraviolet, EUV lithography tools will become indispensable and I expect the transition to EUV to be spread over a number of years and to be quite challenging for the industry.", "With regard to post NAND technology alternatives, I remain optimistic about our three-dimensional 3D Read/Write directories currently under development with our partner, Toshiba. As I have said previously, I expect highly-scaled NAND and post-NAND technology to happily co-exist over the next decade.", "Moving to IT, our flash memory and system portfolios and know-how are now dominated by many strong second-generation patents. These patents cover managed NAND, multi-bits NAND, advanced NAND device, process and memory chip design patents, solid-state disk, secure portable content, strong error-correcting algorithms, high-speed flash caching, wear-out optimization, application adaptive storage, 3D memories and so on. We believe this IT will provide us substantial leverage in the years ahead.", "Turning now to our target markets, we have previously spoken about the legacy consumer markets, the mobile market and computing including SSD and cloud storage. Of these, we believe that mobile continues to present us the greatest opportunities in the coming years. The more than 1.2 billion handsets that will be sold this year dwarf any other consumer or computing market.", "Increasingly, these are Smartphones and tablets which are morphing into sophisticated portable PCs that are always connected and that increasingly require more flash storage to support the explosion in third-party mobile apps and user content. Handsets are also rapidly assuming the role of the ultimate portable convergence device first with music and cameras, then with video games, video capture, GPS and Apps.", "As for SSD, these are transforming enterprise storage as we speak and we are within one or two generations from the mass adoption in notebook PCs and other thin clients. To be a market leader in SSD, you need to have access to leading edge, high quality flash, shippable in high volumes at a competitive cost, applying sophisticated know-how for managing highly scaled NAND, having the requisite patents and building on strong OEM credentials. SanDisk has it all and we are working diligently to gain leadership position in this space.", "As for our balance sheet, the numbers speaks for themselves, and I believe that Sandak is exceptionally well-equipped to execute our long term global growth strategy. Last but not the need least, our people. SanDisk people the can-do team driven by passion for innovation with a consistent track record of flawless execution through good and bad times. SanDisk\u2019s technologies and engineers retained deep technology DNA from our early days.", "Under Sanjay\u2019s leadership, I believe SanDisk will continue to grow and prosper in the coming years.

We are particularly pleased with the strong growth of our embedded products business during the quarter. With an increasing number of handsets with our iNANDs for embedded storage going into production, iNAND units sold increased more than 100% from Q2 levels.", "Our embedded products including iNANDs made up nearly 30% of our OEM revenues, up from just under 20% in Q2. Furthermore, strong focus on customer qualification and adoption of our X3 based iNAND products is starting to pay off as certain handsets with our X3 iNAND embedded are now starting production.", "Our iNAND product line is also starting to generate design wins in numerous tablet SKUs and we are excited to be part of this rapidly evolving new product category. Additionally, in the third quarter, we had a successful launch of our embedded solid state drive, the iSSD with capacities ranging from 4 to 64 gigabytes and it has generated a high level of interest from both the PC and non-PC OEMs. We expect this product category to grow in 2011 and beyond.", "Retail delivered a solid quarter as total unit sales grew at a healthy double digit rate on a year-over-year basis and sequential basis with the average capacity of retail units sold approaching 5 gigabytes. In North America, we saw the anticipated seasonal lift in USB flash drive sales primarily driven by back-to-school season.", "We also saw a healthy double-digit revenue growth from BRIC regions, both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. In Europe, despite weak consumer sentiments our sales grew nicely and we believe increases in channel penetration and strong brand preference are leading to market share gains there.", "From an operation standpoint, our fabs completed the transition to 32-nanometer technology is. A high mix of 32-nanometer X3 technology in the third quarter enabled us to deliver record product gross margins. We expect to begin volume production of both X2 and X3 memory architectures on our 24-nanometer technology in the fourth quarter.", "I would like to make a few comments about the pricing environment. Industry pricing trends began to soften in the second half of Q3 in certain segments. We believe that this is primarily due to pockets of demand, supply, imbalances caused by low grade TLC, meaning competitors three-level cell NAND and early production of 2X nanometer products from other suppliers that are not qualified by large OEMs.", "We believe that this low grade pricing impacted certain parts of our OEM business, specifically white label cards and wafers where we chose not to compete at some of these prices with our high quality X3.", "A brief update on Fab capacity. The final phase of Fab 4 expansion is underway and we expect the facility to attain its full capacity in mid 2011. Regarding Fab 5, we continue to proceed with caution and have not made the final decision regarding ramp start date or the base of expansions.", "To summarize, we are very pleased with our third quarter execution and performance. The fundamental growth drivers for NAND flash remained firmly in place and I look forward to providing you an update on our fourth quarter results and future outlook earlier next year.", "I will now hand the call over to Judy.", "Judy Bruner", "With third quarter revenue growth of 32% year-over-year and operating margins of 35% on a GAAP basis and 37% non-GAAP, I believe our performance stands out even within a favorable NAND industry environment.", "Our revenue of $1.234 billion was in the higher end of the range we predicted in July, with both product revenue and license and royalty revenue coming in as expected. Our product revenue for the third quarter shifted a bit toward retail, with a mix of 62% OEM and 38% retail. Our ASP per gigabyte declined a modest 5% with our prices mostly firm through August and some price reductions in September.", "Our Q3 gigabytes sold grew 8% sequentially and 71% year-over-year and on a year-to-date basis, our gigabytes sold have grown 84%.

On a sequential basis, OEM revenue did grow from mobile products but was offset by a reduction in other product categories, primarily white label cards and wafers.", "Across all channels, our third quarter revenue by end market came 50% from the mobile market, 22% from imaging, 10% from USBs, 10% from other product markets, and 8% from license and royalty revenue.", "Our product gross margin increased 6 percentage points sequentially to 48%, our highest ever product gross margin with our products cost per gigabyte improving 13% sequentially compared to only a 5% price decline. Our cost decline was stronger than expected due primarily to higher 32-nanometer yields and rapid transition to 32-nanometer X3.", "X3 memory continued to account to more than half of our shipments and non-captive memory was used for only 1% of our shipments. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew $13 million sequentially with the growth predominantly in R&D. Sales and marketing expenses were down slightly sequentially as certain we had anticipated in Q3 moved to Q4.", "Our non-GAAP other income of $15 million included gains of $8 million related to foreign exchange and the sale of certain investments. Our expected non-GAAP tax rate for the year has come down to 35% and this reduced rate combined with certain one-time items resulted in a third quarter non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 34%.", "On the balance sheet, cash and short and long-term marketable securities increased sequentially by $1.3 billion to over $5 billion.

Please note that non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation tables for all applicable guidance is posted on our website.", "As we forecast Q4, we believe that demand for NAND is fundamentally strong with the strongest growth drivers being the secular trends in mobile phones and tablets, and growth from these end markets primarily shows up in our OEM business. We believe macroeconomic weakness, particularly in the US and Europe, continues to limit growth in our retail demand. However, consumers are still buying as seen in our Q3 retail results and we expect increased retail demand in Q4 for the holiday season.", "In terms of unit and headed by demand, we expect good growth from both our OEM and retail channels in the fourth quarter. On the pricing front, we do expect higher price decline in our Q4 than in our Q3 and we have already made certain price adjustments.", "Taking into account these factors, we expect fourth quarter total revenue to be between $1.25 billion and $1.325 billion, and within this total Q4 revenue, we forecast license and royalty revenue between $85 million and $90 million. This fourth quarter forecast was lead to full year revenue between $4.75 billion and $4.825 billion in the middle of our July forecast of $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion.", "Turning to gross margin, there are three key factors that we expect will lead to lower gross margin in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. First, we expect the higher rate of price decline. Second, the yen has appreciated relative to the dollar by approximately 7% since the beginning of our third quarter to present. This increases the dollar costs of the wafers we purchased in the last quarter and these wafers will be reflected in our fourth quarter sales.", "Last, with the 32-nanometer transition completed and more non-captive purchases in Q4, we will see less cost reduction in Q4 as compared to Q3. Our forecasted non-GAAP product gross margin for Q4 is between 39% and 42%, yielding a total non-GAAP gross margin including licensee and royalty of 43% to 46%. To put this in perspective, our 32-nanometer transition was faster with higher yields than expected, which accelerated some of our planned second half cost reductions into Q3.", "Our guidance for Q4 leads to a second half product gross margin above the estimate I provided in July. We expect fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses between $205 million and $210 million, with increases primarily in R&D and in sales and marketing for seasonal retail marketing programs.", "Our Q4 forecast for non-GAAP other income is approximately $10 million and we estimate a non-GAAP tax rate of 34%, including some one-time benefits. On a GAAP basis, there is the possibility that we will release a substantial portion of our tax valuation allowances in the fourth quarter.", "Our total capital investment forecast for Fab and non-Fab purchases remains at approximately $1.1 billion for 2010, meaning that the investment level in Q4 is estimated at approximately $425 million, reflecting investments for both the 24-nanometer transition and Fab 4 expansion.", "The estimated fourth quarter cash equipment for these investments is expected to be approximately $75 million in loans to the Fab joint ventures and approximately $30 million for non-Fab purchases. Given this, the fourth quarter should be another good quarter for free cash flow.", "In summary, our third quarter results were outstanding and our fourth quarter gross margins and operating margins are forecasted to be very attractive. We will now open the call for your questions.", "Elizabeth, could you poll the callers for questions please?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question today will come from Gary Hsueh with Oppenheimer.", "Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer", "Congratulations on the stunning results here on gross margin. Judy, just wanted to dig a little bit deeper here in terms of the gross margin. In terms of your guidance 39% to 42% for the product gross margin, exactly what does that correspond to in terms of cost per bit reduction because, I might have faulty math here but it looks like even at 42% gross margin, you are really not modeling or baking or taking in its account very much cost per bit reduction. It looks pretty flat even at the high end of the gross margin guidance. Could you kind of, walk me through what exactly your cost per bit reduction visibility is for Q4 and maybe where I have math wrong?", "Judy Bruner", "Let me help you a little bit. We do expect cost per bit reduction in the fourth quarter. I will tell you that it\u2019s in a single digit percentage as compared to the 13% that we just experienced in the third quarter. That is factored into my 39% to 42%. Again, that single digit percentage is less than the third quarter because we completed the 32-nanometer transition in the third quarter and we\u2019re now starting 24-nanometer transition, which will largely benefit our 2011 costs.", "As I mentioned, we also have the impact of the yen and a bit more non-captive purchases that\u2019s impacting the total cost per bit reduction in the fourth quarter. We do expect continued cost reduction per bit and we expect our full year cost reduction per bit to be well over 40%, full year over full year.", "Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer", "I got a quick follow-up here for either Sanjay or Eli just about maturation of the X3 architecture here. Are you guys seeing any kind of incremental benefits now that you\u2019re in your third generation for X3 in terms of basically reducing the bill of materials or COGS related to cards? Are you seeing an ability to extract a little bit more cost savings on the memory controller side as you shrink? Or are you otherwise able to come away and produce cards with a little bit less over-provisioning in terms of the content as you go from one generation to the next? Are there any other offsets on gross margin on the card perspective that\u2019s helping you out here in Q4 and may be longer term in 2011?", "Eli Harari", "On the card basis, a very important element is, what is the maximum die size and capacity that you can fit into a microSD. microSD is the highest running volume cards for us and I believe for the industry. So, our X3, 32-nanometer X3, 32-gigabit die fits very nicely into a microSD and at 24-nanometer technology we expect a 64-gigabit to do the same with X3 but not with X2. X2 versus X3 allows you to shoehorn into a microSD which is I believe 11x15 millimeter and that ability to grow to higher capacities without double the number of half capacity chips translates into significant cost reductions.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee.", "Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee", "I was just wondering looking out if you could walk us through what the cost reductions were in 4Q outside you said the 32-nanometer transition is over and so cost reductions in 4Q and what you see in the first half?", "Judy Bruner", "Vijay, even though we completed the 32-nanometer transition in the third quarter, we will still see benefit from that in our cost reductions in the fourth quarter that will spill over and benefit our fourth quarter. We\u2019ll still have a higher percentage essentially all 32-nanometer in the fourth quarter. That will be the key driver of fourth quarter cost reduction. Then in the first half of 2011, we\u2019ll begin to see cost reduction from 24-nanometer.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Just to be clear, we completed the 32-nanometer transition by end of the third quarter. There was still 43-nanometer product that was shaped in the third quarter. In fourth quarter, it will be a greater percentage of 32-nanometer products.", "Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee", "The Fab 4 expansion you said it will be completed by mid-2011. How much expansion will you be doing, let\u2019s say, in terms of wafer starts, let\u2019s say, in Q4 and let\u2019 say, by mid-2011 in the first half?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We are not exactly providing the specifics laid down between Q4 and first half. As we have said, in the third quarter, we had started ramping our production of the available room space in Fab 4 and we need that capacity to meet our requirements in Q3 as well as in Q4 timeframe. This expansion will continue and we expect it to be completed by mid-2011.", "Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee", "When you look at 3Q, what is the wafer capacity in Fab 4 and when you look at mid-2011, what\u2019s the wafer capacity in Fab 4 once it\u2019s all completed?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "With respect to exact numbers for wafer capacity, we are not providing that. What we have said before is that once Fab 4 completes expansion and the full capacity is up, our portion of Fab 4 will be at the rate of 2 million 12-inch NAND wafers per year. Let me be clear, this is Fab 3 and Fab 4 combined.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Uche Orji from UBS.", "Uche Orji - UBS", "Eli, let me just start of with asking you about the impact you would expect your SSD products will have. I mean yesterday Apple talked about this is not the future of notebook market. I just kind of wanted to get a sense of what engagements you think you\u2019re having right now and specifically, we can talk about tablet market as well, whether these NAND products you have is something that should lead to high engagements in those markets?", "Eli Harari", "The announcement this week MacBook Air having SSD as standard is I believe very, very important, not so much because of MacBook Air itself but because it\u2019s really an industry signal I believe. Apple has done so in the past.", "Apple was a first company to introduce PCs without a floppy disk at a time where everybody thought you\u2019ve got to have floppies and I think that this going with a standard notebook PC that has nothing but flash memory, I think is going to force competitors to much more seriously go in that direction, but we all know that the real driver for mass adoption of flash memory, SSD in this type of notebook PCs is very much we need to get to a lower cost and that will happen I believe.", "Tablets are, it\u2019s really in different manner. This is really a product category that came out nowhere, it never was expected to be where it is today, even just six months ago and the nice thing about tablets almost by definition, 10-hour operations, very thin light weight, none of the tablets anymore actually none of the tablets are designed to use hard disk drive that was not the case for netbook PCs, where we all expected netbook PCs to be with primarily with flash memory SSD but pSSD but, in fact, turned out to be hard disk drive based.", "Tablet PCs to the extend that they cannibalize notebook PCs, that\u2019s good news for us and for the industry because notebook PCs really are not today using SSD to any large extent, whereas tablet PCs to the extent that they cannibalize notebook PCs, that\u2019s good news for flash for all the industry and certainly for ourselves.", "Uche Orji - UBS", "Judy, let me ask you about pricing again, let me, I know something this gross margins. Let me just dig into the price elements of what\u2019s going to drive gross margins. If ASPs were to hold where they are today, you\u2019ve seen some decline already in October. What will ASP be by the end of the quarter? Also, the elements of non-captive, you ended up with just 1% of non-captive in Q3, what is the availability now from the non-captive markets? How much should we think about your demand for non-captive to meet your guidance need to be for the December quarter?", "Judy Bruner", "First on pricing. We\u2019re not going to give any specific pricing guidance for the fourth quarter, but we do expect higher price decline in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. Keep in mind that our price decline this year has been quite benign and every quarter this year the year-over-year price decline has been 20% or less. So, the full year price decline even with higher price decline in the fourth quarter is going to be quite low in historical terms. In terms of our non-captive for the fourth quarter and assumed in our guidance is that we\u2019ll utilize non-captive in the sort of the low to mid single digit range as a percentage of our total supply. So, up somewhat from the third quarter but not a very large percentage.", "Uche Orji - UBS", "Just one last question either for you Sanjay or for Eli, on that TLC, one of the criticisms with that of a TLC is it\u2019s really not good enough for the embedded markets. I just want to ask you what your own thoughts are on that and whether you\u2019ve had any embedded engagement for TLC. Then, also on the TLC price trends going forward, one of the things that was great for you in the June quarter, I remember you mentioned was you were able to get some premium on the TLC pricing. As you start to see other people introduce TLC no matter what kind of grade it is, should we expect that to now have more of the pull down on the pricing for you on TLC going forward?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We have said before that our 3-bit per cell memory, what we call X3, really leverages as many, many years of system level expertise that we have built to deliver and level products to the consumers that are high quality products, and actually those products were built with our X3 memory meet the specification of others compete quite well with this specifications that are delivered by others even with their X2 2-bit per cell as memory. This is what provides us with the pricing power with our X3 memory. We really continue to leverage that very well across our product lines and as I referred to in my prepared remarks we are looking at X3 memory, our 3-bit per cell memory, starting to look at that on the embedded application side as well.", "Overall, over X3 strategy continues to work well. If to the extent that there is any low grade memory from others that, such as the TLC memory from some competitors or other low grade memory, which may be coming from early 2X nanometer production of others, that does impact some parts of our business but in the third quarter we chose not to compete with our high quality X3 memory with respect to the low pricing that was there from the TLC, the low grade memory of others.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Daniel Amir with Lazard Capital Markets", "Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets", "A couple of questions here. First of all, I mean, how do you see the tablet market impacting demand/supply environment next year, and could we potentially see a more benign pricing environment in Q1 because of this?", "Eli Harari", "We see a lot of design activity in tablets that clearly has been influenced to a large extent by the introduction of the iPad. You all heard Apple\u2019s press conference and you know what Steve Jobs thinks about the people\u2019s tablet. We think that the market does need competition and we will have competition to the iPad as good as the iPad, it is a great product and the industry would learn to use Android or other operating systems such as the RIM operating system to provide tablets with different functionality and we expect that to be a significant force in 2011 and we see great opportunity for us to participate in that.", "Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets", "With regards to the iNAND, it seems like its 30% of the OEM business, it\u2019s growing quite significantly. I mean, can you give us a little more clarity on what the momentum that you\u2019re seeing there in terms of design activity and where do you really want this business to go? I mean, could this be potentially half of your OEM business, I mean is that the direction?", "Judy Bruner", "Well, not really prepared to provide any specific percentages here. All I can tell you is that we are actually doing very well with our iNAND design wins as well as iNAND shipping into volume productions with respect to Smartphones and the design wins in the tablet space. As Eli mentioned earlier, these are huge demand categories for our business and we are making very strong inroads here and we believe we are gaining share in this particular segment.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Atif Malik with Morgan Stanley.", "Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley", "Congratulations on the great quarter. Eli, you once said that not all NAND is created equally. If I look at the pricing that you guys showed in 3Q, you guys have a lot of people fooled. Your price decline was quite modest relative to what some of the Tier 2 prices decline people saw. So, my question is, if I look at the MLC price decline, pretty wide spread, up 10% for high grade OEM made and then down 25% on the low end. So, what is the barrier to other guys, I mean how sustainable is this gap in your view moving forward?", "Eli Harari", "I think that NAND is getting more and more difficult to make and it is up. I firmly believe that the combination of Toshiba and SanDisk really have superior NAND technology and products. Of course, other people think the same of theirs and they are entitled to do that. Toshiba and SanDisk combined generate about 40% of world output and our own quality standards are pretty high. As we penetrate more and more OEM business, OEMs, major OEMs, have very high standards for quality and we have really to a large extent stayed away from playing in these low quality, low price markets.", "Now, I\u2019ve also said many times that I believe it\u2019s very important for the industry to have continuous price reductions that are in line with cost reductions. The industry has had the benefit of really two generations of technology from the 43-nanometer to the 32 and next year 24, 27, with very, very substantial cost reductions that area leading to the very excellent gross margins which have been wonderful for stable pricing and so on. On the other hand, there is no question about it that some markets do require, like SSD, require some price reductions that take advantage of these cost reductions.", "I used to accelerated these new markets as well as broaden our appeal to new strata of customers. So, I think price reductions, like we said, this year we think the industry, total price reduction year-to-year is about 20%, that\u2019s very unusual. It has helped industry recover its health but the cost reductions really do allow us and the industry I believe in 2011 to get closer to what some of these markets need to have. So, in general I feel very good about our ability and I can\u2019t speak for the industry, to continue cost reductions through technology through execution on our 24-nanometer with 3 bits per cell and we expect that this will allow us to be a very competitive player in these new markets in 2011.", "Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley", "The second one for Judy. I don\u2019t want you to guide cost reduction into 1Q but I just want to understand the linearity of the 24-nanometer transition that you guys just started in 4Q. I mean, typically these transitions they happen over multiple quarters, is it fair to assume that the linearity of this transition is going to through the next two or three quarters into next year?", "Judy Bruner", "The transition will definitely take several quarters. As to exactly the linearity of that transition, it\u2019s a little bit early to predict that at this point in time.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Daniel Berenbaum with Auriga USA.", "Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA", "A couple of questions on 3-bit per cell actually, did you talk about what is it any 3-bit per cell being used in embedded right now? What percentage of your embedded business is 3-bit per cell?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "No. We did not statistically breakdown what percentage of 3-bit per cell is in embedded. Overall, utilization of 3-bit per cell for all of our business, OEM and retail business combined for 2010 is greater than 50%. In terms of the embedded business, we have started shipping our 3-bit per cell for certain embedded application. Most of the embedded application that are shipping today is still 2-bit per cell and this is a progress that we look forward to making in the future with respect to our superior 3-bit per cell technology.", "Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA", "Well, can you sort of point us maybe across the next year how fast you expect 3-bit per cell to grow in embedded and what applications is suitable for an embedded?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "I think regarding next year in terms of progress of 3-bit per cell, we\u2019ll probably provide you some color on that in the January-February timeframe. In regard to the 3-bit per cell embedded applications, of course, we are continuing to work on that in the mobile handset the Smartphone space and particularly with respect to high capacity iNAND products.", "Eli Harari", "Let me give you a little bit of technology, just a little bit of technology. I will try to keep it a very simple. Our 3-bit-per-cell embedded iNAND, actually can write and very often relies on writing data into binary, SLC, not just 2 bits and certainly not 3 bits, but writing it to 1-bit-per-cell and then in background writing it into 3-bits-per-cell and that is what we call flash caching and adaptive flash memory, but we adapt the iNAND to that specific application.", "That is where we have this benefit that our X3 can look in an application superior to somebody else\u2019s X2 because actually we have this combination, which is very nicely covered by early patents between writing in binary and in background writing into X3. This is where you see tremendous advantage to experience and to the system know-how that we\u2019ve been talking about.", "Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA", "Then maybe just a more near term question looking out to Q4. Judy, you mentioned the percentage of non-captive capacity growing, but it seems that bit shipments in this quarter were at least the bit shipping growth was relatively low. Again, just sort of doing some of the math, it seems like bit shipments next quarter would need to grow at 40% plus to hit that kind of 75% for the full year that you talked about having enough internal capacity for. Am I thinking about that the right way and I guess the question is, how certain are you that you\u2019re going to need to go outside for non-captive capacity?", "Judy Bruner", "You\u2019re right that in total our third quarter bit growth was a little bit less than we\u2019ve typically seen in the third quarter. I\u2019ll talk about the third quarter first and then the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, we actually were quite pleased with the bit growth in the retail part of our business. We saw a strong bit growth sequentially in the retail business.", "In the OEM business, we saw more modest bit growth, but we had good bit growth overall in the mobile handset part of our OEM business and that was offset somewhat by the fact that we chose not to participate, as Sanjay described, in some of the low-priced business in the white label card and also in the wafer business. So, that impacted somewhat our bit growth there.", "I\u2019ve also mentioned that our bit growth in OEM in the third quarter was also impacted somewhat by the fact that there were some non-memory component shortages early in the third quarter that limited somewhat the shipment of certain handsets. When those handset shipments were limited that also then limited somewhat our sales of NAND into those handsets. We believe that that issue has been solved in the marketplace and that\u2019s not an issue in the fourth quarter.", "Turning to the fourth quarter, in the fourth quarter, we believe that we will strong bit growth both in the retail part of our business and in the OEM part of our business. So, we\u2019re not giving any specific guidance but I think you are thinking about it correctly, as you try to model your bit growths for the year.", "Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA", "Where those bits that you didn\u2019t ship in Q3, the inventory are didn\u2019t go up that much, so I guess my questions is, where are those bits? Are they in inventory at handset manufacturers or are they in inventory someplace else?", "Judy Bruner", "Well, our inventory is lean. It would have been even leaner if we had shipped more in the third quarter and in fact, that is why we think we do need a little bit of non-captive in the fourth quarter and more non-captive in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter.", "Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA", "You would sort of implicitly expect inventory to go down in Q4?", "Judy Bruner", "I don\u2019t know that it will actually go down. It\u2019s possible it could go up some because remember, we are still ramping Fab 4, so we will have more bits coming in from Fab 4 even late in the quarter. Also, just in terms of the dollar value of the inventory, I can\u2019t predict what will happen to the yen over the next three months, but the appreciation of the yen also puts pressure on the dollar value of the inventory.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Kate Kotlarsky with Goldman Sachs.", "Kate Kotlarsky - Goldman Sachs", "A couple of questions if I may. The first question I have is around the Fab 5 and just wanted to ask you guys, you do seem to be pretty bullish on the outlook for NAND demand next year but you sound a little bit cautious on not the Fab 5 RAM, but at least the commitment to Fab 5 and how much you think you might ramp next year, so I was just hoping you can reconcile those two things for us kind of the cautious approach to Fab 5 yet being very bullish on NAND demand next year?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "As we said, we definitely believe in the fundamentals being strong for our business in the Smartphone, the tablets and the rest of the business as well for next year. With respect to Fab 5, we are exercising the discipline and we want to make sure that we assess our demand projections before we really commit to the start of the fab 5 production. Keep in mind that fab 5 is currently under construction and we have lead time available for us to really make decisions regarding the start of fab 5.", "Kate Kotlarsky - Goldman Sachs", "Maybe one another question and this relates to the comment that Eli made earlier about having to have cost declines and ASP declines in order to drive some of the demand in applications like solid state drives and tablets et cetera. Was curious how you guys are thinking between the balance of having to take ASPs down maybe for you guys and for the industry as a whole in order to drive some of these applications. Maybe what kind of ASP declines do you think the industry needs to get to in order to have meaningful content growth in some of these applications like tablets and Smartphones next year?", "Eli Harari", "I think this is a very good question. Price declines, as we know, healthy for industry growth if they are in line with cost declines and if they are too slow with regards to cost declines they start slowing down growth if they are too fast, they create problems for the return on investment on our capacity. I would say in the fourth quarter this year SSD is not where it thought it would be a year ago because of the pricing during this year and SSD we all know needs to have a lower price point and what I said earlier is that the industry and certainly SanDisk has significantly lower cost structure as evidenced by our product gross margin in the third quarter.", "What I\u2019m saying is, it is very important if you\u2019re looking long-term for sustainable growth with profitability and good return on investment, it is very important for us and I can\u2019t talk for the industry but for ourselves to have a balanced not to be overly greedy frankly on the upside so that the downside as we know up cycles in this thing, are much more mild and acceptable. I know I\u2019m not giving any number.", "All I\u2019m saying is that 20% price decline for 2010 has been very important to get the industry back into (inaudible) but the industry has also done very well in terms of cost reductions far exceeding 20% and I think it would be healthy for the industry and I am speaking really for SanDisk to have a balance between maximizing gross margins on one hand and growing our markets for the long term.", "Kate Kotlarsky - Goldman Sachs", "In your view, the 20% is the reduction that we saw this year is probably not enough to drive meaningful content growth next year and that we probably need to see something greater than that, maybe it\u2019s not 50%, but it\u2019s probably not 20%. Would that be a fair characterization?", "Eli Harari", "Yes.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "Eli, you touched on PC adoption for SSDs, I was wondering if you might just look out into the future and give us some idea when you think PC SSD adoption might get to some benchmark level of say around 20%?", "Eli Harari", "It all clinches on really the 24-nanometer and let\u2019s say, the 20-nanometer node. At 24-nanometer, the cost structure is very attractive, I believe, for SSD, particularly if one can deliver SSD with reasonable performance with 3 bits per cell, but even with 2 bits it gets a lot closer to where the mass market develops. At 20-nanometer, I think, the mass markets really begin to take off.", "We didn\u2019t want to two generations I believe of having the right cost structure for end performance, because performance is constantly improving actually at a very nice rate and reliability problems are being addressed very nicely throughout the industry, that I believe within the next one to two generations you\u2019re going to a significant move on the upside for SSD and I don\u2019t mean the enterprise SSD because as we know that\u2019s already taking place because they can tolerate SLC pricing which is, of course, significantly higher per gigabyte.", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "Judy, as I look at the cash CapEx this year, it strikes me that the mix of cash CapEx is far lower than anything I can remember seeing back to 2004, which is pretty remarkable and I\u2019m wondering is the mix of CapEx funding with such a large portion of it coming from joint venture working capital, something that\u2019s sustainable and if it is, then what does SanDisk plan to do with the excess cash that it looks like it will between piling up as we look out to 2011 and 2012.", "Judy Bruner", "I\u2019d tell you that there has been growth, real growth in the cash generation power of the joint ventures, particularly as they have matured and become more depreciated. At the same time, some of the capital investment that we are making this year, such as the Fab 4 expansion in the second half of 2010, some of that will require some cash infusion in the early part of 2011.", "There will be some more cash that needs to be put into the joint ventures in the 2011 timeframe. I think that it\u2019s our business model is a little different obviously than the business model of a company that owns it fabs directly and it makes it a little bit hard to decipher, but you have to keep in mind that instead of seeing the depreciation in our results, you are seeing the operating cash flow of the joint venture themselves. Think that\u2019s natural and we feel very good about the relatively minimal amount of cash that we\u2019ve had to put in this year.", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "Next year\u2019s cash component will increase, but would it increase to levels that are below pass normative levels or would we move back more towards normative levels Judy?", "Judy Bruner", "It will still be better than it has been in the past, but exactly how much cash we have to put in next year is still not known at this point because we haven\u2019t really formulated our capital investment plans for next year, including Sanjay described that we don\u2019t have a ramp plan decided for Fab 5. We\u2019ll have to really provide more details on that in our February Analyst Day.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Bob Gujavarty with Deutsche Bank", "Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank", "Judy, could you rank the relative weights on margin? What\u2019s going to weigh our margins between the ASP declines offsetting COGS, yen appreciation and then finally non-captive? Can you rank them for us on which is most significant and least significant?", "Judy Bruner", "I\u2019m not going to rank them from one to four for you, but I will say that the non-captive is probably the smallest factor in the fourth, and really the two primary factors are that we do expect increased price decline and we do expect a lower rate of cost decline. There is a couple of factors that lead to the lower rate of cost decline, including the timing of the technology transitions and the yen as I described.", "Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank", "Then just a quick follow-up, I mean assuming normal seasonality, would it be fair to say that you\u2019d have less need for non-captive capacity in the first half of the year compared to the second half of the year?", "Judy Bruner", "It\u2019s really hard to predict our usage of non-captive at this point for next year. That might more likely be true for the first quarter in term of typical historical first quarter seasonality. Hard to say for the first half.", "Bob Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank", "Just final quick one, as the yen and dollar stabilize at these levels will the exchange rate be a further headwind in heading into 1Q or I\u2019m just trying to figure out how long the tale is in terms of the exchange rate move?", "Judy Bruner", "If it\u2019s stabilizes at these levels the yen has continued to appreciate, let\u2019s say, over the last month. Yes, there would be a little bit more of a headwind relative to the average wafer cost purchased in Q3 and recognized in the fourth quarter cost of sales. I want to point out, however, though that really the yen has appreciated a fair amount not just in the last quarter but really in the last one to two years and that is all incorporated in our 48% product gross margins this quarter. That\u2019s something to keep in mind in terms of how well we have performed.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to management for any closing comments.", "I just want to say, this has been an incredible 22-year ride with all of you guys and Sanjay and SanDisk have a great absolutely great future. We go here with go SanDisk. Thank you.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Thank you all.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

[Operator Instructions] Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.", "Bob Blair", "Thank you. I want to mention that we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning a number of matters: the total available market for hard drives in the March quarter and in 2011, industry capital expenditures for 2011, our growth rate and growth plan for 2011, our growth opportunities in the medium to long term, our position within the storage industry, our inventory holding and supply and demand balancing in the March quarter, our expected capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization and tax rate for fiscal 2011, our share repurchase plans, our financial results expectations for the March quarter, including revenue, gross margin, expenses, tax rate, share count and earnings per share.

I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investors Section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of this call. I now turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, John Coyne.", "John Coyne", "Thank you, Bob. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me on our Q2 call are Tim Leyden, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wolfgang Nickl, our Chief Financial Officer. Calendar 2010 was a year of tremendous opportunity for the hard drive industry with 651 million drives shipped. That's 330 million terabytes of storage capacity sold into a broadening set of applications and markets. At 16%, this was the industry's strongest full year unit growth in five years. Rotating magnetic storage remains the dominant technology solution for high-volume mass storage of digital content in both the consumer and commercial markets. Full year revenue for the industry expanded by some 13% to $34 billion. However, it was also a year of significant missed opportunity as the industry's supply-demand dynamic deteriorated as the year progressed, resulting in sharply declining ASPs, with the final quarter demonstrating a year-over-year decline in industry revenue of 7% on a unit increase of 4%, and an even sharper decline in profitability. ", "WD again outperformed the industry in calendar 2010. We grew units 23%, revenues by 19% and operating income by 12%. The operating income number reflected the significant challenge of the industry's ASP deterioration that emerged midyear. While we improved our financial performance sequentially in the December quarter, we are far from happy that we failed to monetize our growth throughout the year and generate the kind of return needed to sustain robust investment in technologies and products to improve our customers' future experience. ", "In the coming year, we expect the hard drive volume opportunity to approach 700 million units, representing a storage capacity of approximately 440 million terabytes. Our estimate of the investment required by the hard drive community, including our component suppliers, to support this growth is approximately $5 billion. So the need for the industry to perform well enough to sustain its critical role in the digital ecosystem should be clear to us, to our customers and to their customers. In reviewing how we can improve our future performance, we have identified a misalignment in how our industry typically begins the calendar year from a production standpoint, in contrast with the underlying demand trend of PCs, our largest served market. We are determined to start this year with the benefit of lessons learned from this analysis. And Tim and Wolfgang will elaborate on this approach later in this call. ", "In addressing the calendar year 2011 market opportunity, we expect to continue to grow faster than the overall market by providing greater customer value and satisfaction than competition. We will continue to leverage our cost advantage and our relentless focus on high quality, reliability and availability of product especially in the industry's fastest growing market segments. We believe we can achieve this growth plan while at the same time improving the way in which we approach the supply-demand dynamic from the outset of the year. ", "In the medium to long term, we are focused on multiple growth opportunities in both our core business and beyond. First, as I have said, we intend to continue to grow in our existing hard drive segments by providing superior availability, quality, reliability and value, a proven approach that has established us as a leading supplier in each of our served markets today. ", "Second, we will leverage that same approach into the under penetrated markets for WD of gaming and traditional enterprise. We have recently introduced our second-generation SAS product for the traditional enterprise market, along with our first SAS offering for the high-capacity near-line storage market, and we believe our commitment and measured approach to these important markets will earn significant share as we deliver a succession of outstanding products to customers in the years ahead. ", "Third, we are focused on growing our storage presence beyond rotating magnetic media through our leadership in the embedded SSD space and our planned entry into the Tier 0 Enterprise segment for SSD when that market evolves into a significant and profitable market opportunity. In the context of solid state technology, we also continue to evaluate the opportunity to combine rotating magnetic storage with flash into hybrid solutions. ", "Fourth, as highlighted earlier this month at our analyst briefing at the Consumer Electronics Show, we are expanding our TAM by addressing the connected digital home market with products that integrate and bring to life consumers' personal and premium digital content. The acceleration of digital content creation offers almost unlimited opportunities for those smart enough to feel the pulse of the consumer and provide solutions to address the need to safely store, share and experience this growing mass of content, both private and public. This growth is being driven by relentless innovation in hardware and software, which in turn is enabling and encouraging new usage models, such as social media, which all compound to proliferate content and copies of content throughout the world. At WD, we view every device or system which enables and encourages content creation or consumption, including tablets, as a potential opportunity for expanded market participation, either directly or indirectly. Since fiscal 2004, WD has been at the forefront of the still nascent market for branded storage and connected home products with 85 million WD-branded products sold to consumers, including 2.5 million WD TV Media players. We believe this market has the potential to generate significant growth for WD in the years ahead. We will continue to review opportunities to invest in and expand our presence in these and additional aligned markets in the months ahead as part of our strategic evaluation of how to best create value for our shareholders. We're excited about the changing landscape of the digital ecosystem, which we see filled with opportunity for WD. Managing through changing times is in our DNA at WD. ", "We would like to remind investors that we are entering the fourth decade in the storage solutions marketplace with some valuable experiences and lessons learned along the way. Very early on, we were one of the world's leading suppliers of specialized semiconductors to the calculator industry. Beginning in the early '80s, we were the leading maker of stand-alone storage controllers for the original PC before we entered the hard drive business in 1988. Today, we're the world's unit volume leader in hard drives, having evolved from an exclusively desktop player to a broad-based, vertically integrated supplier to multiple market segments with an established consumer brand. So we have seen change and successfully embraced it throughout our history. ", "We believe there is no one better positioned in the storage industry today than WD. We have a track record of good, crisp decision making and execution, a healthy balance sheet to enable prudent and smart investments and a business model that has generated sustained and consistently profitable growth. We remain focused on extending this trend. Tim Leyden will now cover the operational developments and highlights of the December quarter. Tim?", "Timothy Leyden", "Thank you, John. The December quarter industry TAM came in at 167.5 million units compared with 165 million units that we had forecast. Demand was reasonably linear, and our expectation that industry participants would be cautious about carrying excess inventory out of the December quarter proved correct as we saw a moderation of the overweighting of workweek 13 shipments that had occurred in both the June and September quarters. ", "Looking at our served markets in the December quarter. In the compute space, units increased from 114 million to 118 million. Commercial demand remained strong. And while overall consumer demand was below expectations, demand for hard drives was further tempered by inventory reductions both in the system supply chain and in the distribution channel. While the OEM PC shipments increased by nearly 4% sequentially, HDD shipments increased by only 2%, leading to a reduction in inventory within the PC manufacturers' pipeline. We also saw better matching of billed to true demand in the industry as a whole, which resulted in more linear shipments throughout the quarter and less pressure to ship higher volumes later in the quarter. The near-line enterprise market was down sequentially from 6.1 million to 5.7 million units. We believe this was a reflection of the fact that this segment's demand is driven by large discrete project expenditures, which drives lumpier demand patterns. On a full year basis, this segment grew by 50% in calendar year 2010 and now accounts for around 40% of enterprise shipments and will continue to be a high-growth area of the industry. After a three-year period below its previous demand high point, the traditional enterprise market at 8.3 million units returned close to its prerecession level of 8.5 million, reflecting a continuing recovery in the commercial market. For the first time, shipments of the 2.5-inch platform exceeded shipments of the 3.5-inch form factor, validating our decision to direct our traditional enterprise investments towards 2.5-inch SAS. The HDD manufacturers' TAM in the Branded Products segment was at 14.7 million units, up from 11.6 million units in the September quarter and 11.3 million units in the year-ago quarter, presenting further evidence of continuing strong consumer demand for personal storage. In the DVR market segment, TAM was 12.1 million units, down sequentially from 13.2 million and up year-on-year from 11.3 million units. The balance of the TAM is represented by gaming, automotive and 1.8-inch drives. We shipped 52.2 million units in the December quarter, up 5.5% from the year-ago period and 3% sequentially, while the overall market grew by 4.4% and 2.1%, respectively. ", "Revenues totaled $2.475 billion. We expanded gross margin by 19.2%, and we remain solidly profitable with net income of $225 million. Importantly, we continue to generate strong cash flow from operations of $505 million. We are pleased that the moderating steps that we started in the September quarter relative to pricing, production builds, inventory alignment and capital expenditure achieved the desired result of keeping us within our business model parameters in the December quarter. Combined with a heightened emphasis on cost management, those actions contributed to our results being significantly better than we had guided in our October earnings call. We continue to focus on satisfying customer needs, staying on the industry areal density curve and providing competitive products while at the same time maintaining industry cost leadership. ", "Consistent with the plans that we laid out in our October call, we optimized our profitable participation in the market in the December quarter while continuing to satisfy customer requirements. The adaptability of our business model enabled us to optimize mix and that, together with pricing discipline and tight cost management, including accelerated cost improvements from our recently acquired Singapore media facility, contributed to our better-than-expected gross margin. Despite this, we still fell short of the profitability levels that we would normally have expected to achieve in what has traditionally been ours and the industry's most profitable quarter of the year. This is a direct result of the cumulative impact of higher price declines than normal in both the June and September quarters. As a reminder, based on historical achievements in past December quarters, ordinarily, we would expect that the gross margin percentage would be above the midpoint of our margin model range of 18% to 23%. And we are not happy that our fiscal Q2 gross margin performance at 19.2% is well below the midpoint of that range as we head into the more seasonally challenging quarters of the year. ", "While inventories in the HDD supply chain exiting the quarter were well controlled in each segment, we still believe that despite a reduction of approximately 2 million to 3 million HDDs in the PC supply chain, there is still an inventory excess of some 6 million to 8 million HDD units in the PC manufacturers' pipeline, and this will place additional downward pressure on the HDD TAM in the March quarter. Bearing that in mind, we intend to depart from what has been the industry's typical approach to inventory holding and supply-demand balancing in the March quarter. Historically, over the last decade, PC volumes have shown an average unit volume decline of around 9% sequentially when March quarters are compared to the immediately preceding December quarters. Despite that PC industry historical demand trend, the HDD industry has typically shipped volumes that were down approximately 4% sequentially during the same period as HDD producers attempted to utilize the capacity that had already been put in place to service the seasonally stronger December quarter volumes. The consequence of this mismatch in unit volume trends between the PC and the HDD industries has been to put pressure on March quarter pricing, contribute to an inventory overhang exiting the March quarter and consequently exert further pricing pressure in the June quarter, which has repeatedly seen the weakest seasonal demand profile. Consequently, although we believe that end user demand would be around 160 million units, we are forecasting an HDD TAM of 155 million units for the last quarter as we anticipate some further flushing of excess inventory in the PC pipeline. Additionally, we expect volumes in DVR-Branded products and Enterprise segments to be seasonally flat to down sequentially. Despite this slower start to the calendar year, we expect to see mid- to high-single-digit HDD volume growth in calendar 2011. ", "Now turning to our product lineup. We continue to focus on opportunities in the fastest growing market segments, which remains a key strategy for WD. Since our last report, we introduced new products and software that enable consumers to easily move data and content into, around and outside the home and experience their collection of movies, photos and music as well as premium content on the Internet. We launched the new flagship of our popular WD TV Media Player family of products, the WD TV Live Hub, which centralizes and streams movies, photos and music to any connected screen in the home with its 1 TB capacity, media server capability and seamless connection to premium content services such as Netflix, Blockbuster OnDemand and Facebook. We updated our other WD TV products with premium online services first introduced on WD TV Live Hub. With an update to our WD Photos application, we enabled Android smartphone users with the ability to access all their photos residing on My Book Live, My Book World Edition and WD ShareSpace network drives from anywhere in the world that they can connect to the Internet, a feature also available for the iPad, iPhone and iPod touch. ", "In our core Hard Drive business, we began shipping the WD Scorpio Black mobile drive in 750 GB capacity for the road warrior who needs a 7200 RPM high performance and the capacity to carry an entire media collection while traveling. Earlier today, we underscored our long-term commitment to the Enterprise segment by bolstering our product portfolio with two new drive families. Our second-generation, 2.5-inch 10,000 RPM WD S25 SAS drive for mission-critical, high-performance server and storage applications available in both 450GB and 600GB capacities and a new 7200 RPM WD RE SAS 3.5-inch drive available in 1 TB and 2 TB capacities for near-line applications, a large and expanding market serving IT data centers and cloud computing applications. I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang Nickl for a review of our Q2 financial performance and our outlook for the third quarter.", "Wolfgang Nickl", "Thank you, Tim. I would like to remind you that a summary of financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, which will be updated with our Q3 guidance after this call. Revenue for the second fiscal quarter was $2.475 billion, down 5% from the prior year and up 3% sequentially. Hard drive shipments totaled 52.2 million units, up 5% from the prior year period and 3% sequentially. Revenue from sales of WD TV Media Player, WD LiveWire network kits and solid state drives totaled approximately $57 million, up 21% from the prior year and up 54% from the September quarter. Average hard drive selling price was approximately $47 per unit, down $5 from the year ago quarter and up $1 from the September quarter. Revenue from sales of our branded products, including WD TV and WD LiveWire products, was $546 million, down 4% from the year ago quarter and up 28% sequentially. There were no customers that comprised 10% or more of our total revenue. ", "Geographically, all regions contributed revenue gains with Europe showing the best comparative improvement on a sequential basis. From a channel perspective, OEM declined as a percentage of revenue as we actively managed shipments and inventory and the retail channel increased along seasonal expectations. We exceeded the upper end of our revenue guidance by $75 million, which was achieved through a combination of remixing our product and business segments, improved pricing discipline, resulting in lower like-for-like price declines, higher volume due to a slightly higher TAM and moderate market share gains. ", "Our gross margin for the quarter was 19.2%, down from 26.2% in the year ago quarter and up from 18.2% in the September quarter. And this gross margin exceeded our implied guidance by about 320 basis points. There were three main reasons for this. First, our like-for-like price declines were better than we had modeled. Second, we actively drove changes in our product and segment mix. Last but not least, our relentless effort to optimize our product cost yielded larger than anticipated like-for-like cost improvements, with one factor being that our recently acquired Singapore media facility achieved accretion more quickly than anticipated. We had modeled a 50 basis point dilution for the quarter, but we are now experiencing the 50 basis point accretion that we had built into our acquisition models. ", "Total R&D and SG&A spending was $235 million or 9.5% of revenue. This compares with $214 million or 8.2% of revenue in the year ago quarter and $226 million or 9.4% of revenue in the September quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase is primarily a function of increased investment in our Branded Products business. ", "Operating income was $240 million or 9.7% of revenue. This compares with $473 million or 18.1% of revenue in the year ago quarter and $211 million or 8.8% of revenue in the September quarter. Net interest and other nonoperating expenses were $1 million. ", "Tax expense for the December quarter was $40 million or 5.9% of pretax income. The rate for the quarter reflects the retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit that was signed into law during the December quarter. ", "Our net income totaled $225 million or $0.96 per share. This compares with $429 million or $1.85 per share and $197 million or $0.84 per share in the year ago and September quarters, respectively. ", "Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash conversion cycle for the second quarter was a negative two days. This consisted of 46 days of receivables, 26 days of inventory, or 14 turns, and 74 days of payables. We generated $505 million in cash flow from operations during the December quarter, and our free cash flow totaled $255 million. Capital additions for the December quarter totaled $215 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for the second quarter totaled $151 million. We continue to expect our capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 to be between 7% and 8% of revenue, plus up to $200 million for our 6-inch to 8-inch wafer conversion and some smaller expenditures to optimize the output from our recently acquired media facility in Singapore. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be at about $620 million for the fiscal year. We made $25 million of debt repayment installments during the second quarter, and thereby reduced our debt balance to $350 million. We exited fiscal Q2 with cash and cash equivalents of $3.1 billion, an increase of $252 million from the September quarter. ", "Let me now turn to our expectations for fiscal Q3. As Tim indicated, over the last 10 years, PC shipments have declined on average 9% from the December to the March quarter. Yet, hard drive industry shipments have historically decreased by only 4%. This systematically creates a supply-demand dynamic that leads to significant price declines in this and subsequent quarters as we have experienced this past calendar year. Furthermore, despite the fact that the industry had made progress towards balancing supply and demand in the December quarter, we believe that there still remains an excess inventory of 6 million to 8 million units within the PC manufacturers' pipeline. Also, our sense of the market indicates higher than usual PC inventory levels in both the distribution and retail channels. ", "With the objective of entering the June quarter with a more balanced inventory, we estimate that the hard drive industry TAM for the March quarter is unlikely to exceed 155 million units. We strongly believe that the effect from fixed cost under absorption are of much lesser impact to the bottom line than subjecting the entire volume to significant price declines. Having said that, since we operate in a highly competitive market, we've modeled like-for-like price declines of 5%, in line with pricing trends in prior March quarters. We believe our value proposition will continue to resonate with our customers, and we will maintain focused on ROI through product and segment mix management. We continue to strengthen our investments in R&D and market development to support the significant opportunities in our medium and long-term future. Accordingly, our guidance for fiscal Q3 is as follows: we expect revenue to be in the range from $2.2 billion to $2.25 billion; R&D and SG&A spending is expected to total approximately $240 million; our net interest expense is projected to be about $1 million; we expect our tax rate to be at the upper end of our business model of 6% to 9%; we anticipate our share count to be approximately $236 million; we estimate earnings per share of between $0.55 and $0.65 for the March quarter. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG", "I was just curious on your comments about the TAM and the changes in the March quarter. I mean, I think it's admirable to try to change the dynamics of the industry. But I'm curious what you guys think you can do since the competitive market to really change how people build for the March quarter. And if you've said you think there's excess industry units of 6 million to 8 million in hard drives and some excess PC units, how do you really change the behavior and get people to build to that 155 million TAM as opposed to a higher TAM?", "John Coyne", "Well, Sherri, this is John. I think what we've done is to take a good look at the historical trends in the marketplace and the historical behaviors. We've highlighted that there is a misalignment between the traditional market demand drivers and the traditional behaviors relative to supply, and we have all seen what the outcome of that is in terms of those imbalances driving excessive inventories, which in turn tend to drive significant price declines. We're also looking at current situation in the marketplace, in our read of what inventory levels are currently in place. And we're signaling our intent to do as much as we can in developing our build plans to eliminate those misalignments from the supply-demand dynamic. What our competitors do is entirely up to them. It is and has always been, and I believe will continue to be, a highly competitive marketplace. We will track the market very closely. We will defend our market share through the provision of a compelling value proposition to our customers as we have been doing for many, many years. And we will see how the market turns out. I mean, we have been driving a significant profitable business over the last 10 years on a very, very consistent basis. We've consistently expanded market share, a recognition by our customers of the value proposition we offer, which is based on a cost leadership position in the industry. And we will continue to operate, taking maximum leverage and advantage of the characteristics of our model and of our internal capabilities in the context of the market as we see it.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG", "I mean, I think it's an admirable thing to do in terms of trying to change the behavior if there's extra drives that are being shipped in the first quarter. In terms of build plans, I assume that, that means that you're communicating to your suppliers that you're going to ship less and you're structuring your factories so that you are not employing people to manufacture for as many hours. Maybe you could just comment if I'm correct there.", "John Coyne", "That's correct, Sherri. In the approach to any quarter, we typically have a baseline plan, which we communicate both to our internal and build our internal resources around, and calibrate our supply base around that base plan. Again, I'd remind you that our track record of responsiveness to market change is very swift. And our focus in building our manufacturing model and our supply chain has always been on having a competitive edge in the speed with which we can react to both upside and downside changes around our base plan, and we've demonstrated pretty effectively an ability to do that. So again, we have a base plan that is based on the 155 million unit TAM that Wolfgang and Tim have articulated. And we will observe how the market's progressing through the quarter, and we'll take appropriate actions to ensure that we present our customers with opportunity. And we present our business with the maximum opportunity to optimize our results.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG", "If you feel that the industry is shipping more than it needs to, will you allow yourself to lose share or will you still try to keep share?", "John Coyne", "Well, customers will decide that at the end of the day. But we are a for-profit business. We're not a charity.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.", "Bill Shope - J.P. Morgan", "Can you remind us where you are in respect to determining the appropriate uses of your cash balance? And what factors are you considering as you weigh your options?", "Wolfgang Nickl", "Yes, Bill, this is Wolfgang. Our view hasn't changed from what we have communicated in our October call and at the subsequent conference in November in Boston. Our prime focus is to deploy our cash towards strategic opportunities. You'll have noted the old change that we did in the first fiscal quarter with John focusing a lot of his time on strategic development. And we've also mentioned that we will be very careful with this review to make sure that we invest in adjacent markets where we have competencies. And if we determine after the appropriate amount of time that we can be held [ph] [45:22] to an opportunity that adds shareholder value, we will be engaging in share repurchases. We have repurchased about $330 million worth of shares under our current authorization. We have about $416 million left.", "Bill Shope - J.P. Morgan", "And also on the margin trajectory for this year, I understand supply-demand balance is going to be the key swing factor. But can you help us understand how product cycles may or may not impact margins throughout the year? Are you seeing any opportunities for WD to capture any sustained technology leadership as you look forward?", "John Coyne", "I think we would expect that our relative margins on an equivalent product mix will continue to be the best in the industry. We manage technology deployment, the rate of technology deployment. I think one of our key advantages over the years has been our ability to manage that transition from one technology to the next and to make good choices on which capacity points we serve with new technology and which capacity points we serve with current or older technology to maximize our profitability, maximize our ability to deliver consistent quality and reliability to our customers and maximize our availability and responsiveness. So we think we have a pretty good model developed of how to balance all of those forces and a pretty solid track record indicating that, that model is very appropriate to the marketplace.", "Operator", "Mark Moskowitz with J.P. Morgan.", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I share Sherri's confusion over the guidance. I'm not going to go into those details. I want to try to maybe shift the focus to longer term. Could you maybe touch on, John, how investors should think about your opportunities in the enterprise going forward, particularly if there's so much uncertainty around PCs and tablets, what have you? With the transition with Exchange 2010, enabling folks to use SATA drives versus fibre channels, now you have EMC in primary storage where you're looking at SAS and SATA as a substitute for Fibre Channel, this historically has not been your wheel house. It's been more of Seagate's and Apache's. How should we think about this being the offset to some of these other dynamics you're talking about?", "John Coyne", "I think there's two elements to that question, the first of those being in what has been called the traditional enterprise space, which was SCSI, Fibre Channel and, more recently, SAS, and had been predominantly 3.5-inch 10K and 15K product and has been transitioning to a 2.5-inch form factor 10K and 15K. As Tim highlighted, the movement to SAS as the predominant interface in that segment continues, and the transition from 3.5-inch to 2.5-inch form factor continues with 2.5-inch passing the 50% mark for the first time in the quarter just ended.", "Our investments in that space -- we saw those trends emerging over the last several years. The two interfaces, SCSI and Fibre Channel, converging on SAS, and the 3.5-inch form factor transitioning to 2.5-inch. And therefore, over the past several years, as we began to invest in preparation for entry into the traditional enterprise market as one of the few remaining greenfield incremental growth opportunities for us, we focused in on investment in the 2.5-inch SAS environment. And we announced this morning shipments of our second-generation product in that space. If you look at history, our history and our entry into the 2.5-inch mobile arena, many companies' entry into new segments in the industry over time, typically you're in third- or fourth-generation products before you see significant market share traction. You use the first- and second-generation products to establish your credentials and demonstrate your fundamental capabilities of understanding the market segment. And having satisfied customers of that at relatively low volumes, you then begin to gain traction into a substantial presence. We believe that we're on track to achieve that kind of development within the 2.5-inch SAS traditional enterprise market, which, by the time we gain that traction, we expect that, that form factor and interface will command over 70% of that marketplace total demand. In parallel to that, you have the growth area of near-line storage, which is typically, up till now over the last five years, has expanded using a 24/7 high-reliability 3.5-inch SATA drives, what WD calls its RAID Edition products, and we have generated a substantial market position in that segment. And again, as Tim alluded to, that's about a 5 million unit market that has shown a 50% growth rate year-over-year and represents 40% of the total enterprise environment. And that's being driven primarily by cloud computing applications and, as we just announced this morning, a SAS product to service that market. And that demonstrates our ability to leverage core fundamental engineering investments. And then, once we had developed and launched our SAS interface into the market, now we're applying it to multiple platforms and multiple markets.", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Maybe continuing the theme, though, of longer term and also your measured approach to business, historically, as you just touched upon, WD has always done a very solid job in terms of entering new markets and having great success thereafter particularly over the last 10 years. What insights can you share with investors that has given Western Digital really the courage and the focus here now to talk about the home storage in greater detail, the branded opportunity that were mentioned at CES. And the reason I say this is because there seems to be a lot of other providers like the TiVos of the world who've been trying to dabble in this market previously you think they'd already have some pretty good relationships built out. But can you maybe talk about the momentum you've established or the relationships you're building upon to really allow WD to start talking about this as a new adjacent market opportunity?", "John Coyne", "Again, really in our fiscal 2004, which is the end of calendar 2003, was when we began to put significant resource and attention on the personal storage opportunity of taking component-level drives and by combining them with a stylish enclosure and some software, taking them directly to the consumer to satisfy the need for incremental storage beyond the original content consumption and creation device storage capacity that he had initially purchased. In the early days, the design and the software were pretty minimal. However, as we began to focus on that business, we identified, I believe, some critical success factors. One was the need for  a stylish and identifiable product ID. And we, quite outside our experience to that point, engaged professionals in that arena and invested significant amounts of money in creating the WD My Book and My Passport design style, which, based on market reaction, is quite compelling. We made some small investment in a software company several years ago that provides WD with the proprietary capability that drives the iPhone and Android apps that Tim described a moment ago and the ability to access any WD network-connected device through the Internet or throughout your home or office infrastructure. ", "We have continued to invest in software capability. In our Branded business, our engineering resources are 60% software and 40% hardware. And then, overlaid on top of that has been the development of a very strong channel, both in the brick-and-mortar environment and the e-tail environment more recently, where we have developed very strong relationships with our channel partners. And it's really through those channel relationships that we have identified the opportunity to expand the product offering to solve consumers' total in-home experienced problem of how do you not only safely store the content but how do you then allow the consumer to easily experience that content. And as we explored consumers' expectations, as we explored our channel partners' view of us, we discovered that we had built up quite an amount of brand equity and that we were able to use that linked with the engineering resources and the software development resources that we put into the media players to achieve quite a significant level of success. We think our 2.5 million units so far in that market in just a couple of years is pretty good. And so encouraged by that, we have broadened our view of what the total home experience should be and what kinds of devices and services can enhance that experience. And we're exploring ways to deliver those to our customers. For instance, one of the inhibitors in the home is -- to showing full HD video without jerkiness and without interruption is that in most homes, the networking environment is WiFi. And you can't quite keep up with a full HD, full-motion video in a WiFi environment. Most homes do not have broadly embedded dedicated network wires going to all the rooms. And so we came up with our Livewire products, a networking product that uses the power lines in the home so that in a very convenient way for the user, without any major infrastructure development, they can actually transmit all their high-definition video content to every screen in the home in a very cost-efficient and very simple and consumer friendly way. I mean, it is literally as simple as plugging the network wiring to your router and plugging the plug into your electrical outlet. So we're continuing to look at that opportunity, and we're continuing to broaden out the total product portfolio offering. The essence of it is simplicity. The essence of it is liberating the consumer from closed environments that are specific to one vendor or another and allowing multiple formats from multiple sources to be stored, shared and experienced.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC", "I have more questions than we probably have time for here, so I'll just focus on one area here, the TAM guidance. In years past, especially in recent ones, the first quarter, first calendar quarter has fallen less sequentially also because of emerging market demand, other countries having holidays that aren't ours. There's been other dynamics at work. Is your guidance in some way signaling then perhaps that was false thinking? Any thoughts on what perhaps, x-ing out your view of what is inventory some place in a finished PC or something, what the true decline would have been?", "John Coyne", "Yes, I think all of those patterns that relate to emerging markets and so on, they also affect the PC. And so what we're highlighting is the disconnect between the PC and the hard drive quarter-over-quarter declines, that is systemic, has been in place for 10 years while all these things were moving around and shifting and evolving. But even though we have significant markets outside of PC, DVR, personal storage, which is really more of a linkage to installed base than to the incremental new sales, nevertheless PC is a large portion of our total target market. And therefore, the way that the PC moves up and down, I believe now it's significant that we recognize that an attempt to manage the supply-demand and sync with that while also looking specifically at the other emerging and growing applications for hard drives and layering those on top of the PC-driven demand to get their own specific cadence. And while we haven't talked about that in detail in this guidance, it is underlying this guidance. We've looked at every market segment and formed a view about how it's going to perform and matched our supply plan to the demand that we perceive in those markets. Well, we believe that the fundamental disconnect -- and we can argue whether it's 9% versus 4% or whether it should be 9.5% versus 4%, but the fundamental thesis is that overbuilding against the true demand is a recipe for incremental inventory overhang, creating pressure on the marketplace and that the price we pay in under absorption to moderate our supply to match the true demand profile is a much smaller price than the price we have been paying by maintaining production velocity, increasing inventories and then applying extreme pricing pressure to the entire volumes that we produce.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC", "With the guide then correcting -- well, I guess the question is, does that then correct for the 6 million to 8 million in the first quarter TAM? And then if so, should we reasonably assume that the June quarter would be up as you come to meet where the PC demand actually is?", "Timothy Leyden", "Yes, Rich, this is Tim. We believe that it corrects the 155 million TAM that we have outlined. We believe that it corrects for about 5 million of that 6 million to 8 million. And if you take it from the volume that we have right now and then correct for the difference between PC and HDD, it gets you down to around 160 million, and then there's a 5 million inventory correction, we believe, our PC manufacturers' pipeline correction when we get down to the 155 million. In that sense, if that does happen, then it would mean that the comparatives between the March quarter and the June quarter should be more favorable than what they have been historically.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Just a question on the 6 million to 8 million excess drives. Any more color you can add there? Is that multiple OEMs? Are those drives sitting on a boat right now? And what's your confidence level that there are 6 million to 8 million drives?", "Timothy Leyden", "I mean, it's an estimate on our behalf. We don't really have a great level of particular or very specific insight into it. We did estimate in the September quarter that there were approximately around 10 million excess drives in the PC manufacturers' pipeline, and we bled away about 2 million to 3 million of those during the course of the December quarter, which is where we get the 6 million to 8 million.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "And you had mentioned the December quarter was linear. I guess it's fair to assume that the March quarter is going to be more back-end loaded and hard to know what the TAM's going to be until we get deeper in the quarter exactly.", "Timothy Leyden", "No. Actually, if we look at historical linear demand trends, generally in the March quarter, it tends to be also a little bit front-end loaded because you're dealing with a number of different things. You're dealing with the post-Christmas sales, which drives some consumer demand, some extra consumer demand. You're also looking at the lead up to Chinese New Year, which tends to drive some extra demand also. So then, after Chinese New Year, a couple of weeks after Chinese New Year, the demand tends to adapt to the more seasonal profile beginning in March. And then you'll head into the June quarter, which typically has, on a repeated basis, been the weaker quarter. But there's a certain amount of front-end loading in the March quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Fox with CLSA.", "Steven Fox - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Just one question, which is on mix. Can you just go into a little bit more detail on the mix benefit that you saw in the last quarter? And then any color you can provide on how you're anticipating mix to play out for the current quarter?", "Wolfgang Nickl", "There is two forms of mix. This is Wolfgang. One is the product mix. The mix up in the Christmas holiday quarter is usually strong, and it was strong last quarter. And there's the segment mix between our business segments. We've often talked about our margin hierarchy. And our branded business was about 22% of our revenue, up from 18% of our revenue. So in that sense, the business segment mix helped us as well in the quarter we just finished.", "Steven Fox - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "And so going forward, is there any major mix impacts that we should consider?", "Wolfgang Nickl", "Yes, business mix segment changes throughout the quarters. And branded products is usually strong in January and February and then it tends to go off a little bit. So yes, there are segment mix changes all the time in the quarters.", "Operator", "Next comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I think the TAM discussion has been beaten to death. But what I'd like to ask is on your SSD strategy. And I think for the first time it seems like you guys are open to talking about a strategy that involves hybrid HDDs. So can you update us there, what your thinking is, when we should anticipate without maybe announcing a product, but when we should really anticipate Western Digital to move into that market?", "John Coyne", "Well, I think one of WD's characteristics is that we tend to serve markets which exist and which are substantial. And we kind of do our best work in those markets. And so in our SSD participation today, we participate and are in fact the market leader in the most mature SSD market there is, which is the embedded device market. We've taken a look at and in fact shipped product into the SSD, in the client environment, and we don't find a compelling value proposition there either for manufacturer or for customer because the economics don't work. The cost of the storage/performance is too high. And as we look at that client environment and look at what might be an attractive offering that combine the best of both worlds in terms of the performance of solid state with the capacity of rotating media, at a balance of the two, which provided an accessible price point, as we look out into the future where such a device would be supported by operating system capability, which it is not really supported well today, as we look at that over the next couple of years, we see an emerging opportunity for such a device family to offer performance capacity and value. And then in the Tier 0 SSD space, I think the performance delivery has been demonstrated. The continued development of operating system on our tiered architecture enables that as a value proposition, and we have a live investment engineering program currently underway to support that market.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "The follow up question is on the operating expense line. With revenue and volumes down, can you help me understand why OpEx actually picks up this quarter?", "Wolfgang Nickl", "Yes, this is Wolfgang. Again, we believe this is an inventory correction that depresses the TAM to 155 million, and we believe in the long-term growth of the market. We quoted 9% to 10% before on the long-term volume and 5% to 7% on the revenue line, and we feel it's prudent to continue to invest in our market development activities and in our engineering activities. And hence, the increase from $235 million to $240 million in our guidance.", "Operator", "Shebly Seyrafi with Capstone Investment.", "Shebly Seyrafi - Capstone Investments", "One, on the enterprise, you were down sequentially in the seasonally strong calendar Q4. I just want to know what happened there. And when you answer that question, then I'll let you have the second part.", "Wolfgang Nickl", "In our product, we've had some markets we talked about a couple of quarters ago where we had some market issues that we were working on. We believe that we're working through them, and we're getting back to a point where we'll be able to get back to the cadence that we had previously. But we did talk about that a couple of calls ago.", "Shebly Seyrafi - Capstone Investments", "And the second part for me is, you just basically beat your EPS guidance, I believe it was $0.50 to $0.60 for calendar Q4, by 75%. And you have the Singapore facility now being accretive to gross margins. You're modeling up a normal like-for-like price decline this quarter, and you can do things with mix. I'm wondering, because it seems to imply, your guidance seems to imply a gross margin decline to around, I think, 17% to 18%. Why do you think margins will decline considering you basically have these swing factors going in your favor right now?", "Wolfgang Nickl", "Yes, I think you got the math right. It's somewhere around the 18% or the lower end of our model. We know that we'll reduce the volume, and we know that has certain effects from a fixed cost under absorption. We're managing that early on so that we can tool [ph] in your builds. Smooth some of that out. But we have the assumption in there as well that price declines will for this quarter continue to what they have been, the 4%, 5%. And furthermore, earlier on, we talked that there's a little bit of a channel business segment mix impact in the third quarter. And if you take all of these things in consideration, you have a downward pressure on the margin, and that's why we guided to about 1% to 1.5% down quarter-over-quarter.", "John Coyne", "In closing, I'd like to thank all of you for joining us today. We appreciate your questions and your interest in the company and the industry, and we look forward to updating you next quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. This does conclude the conference.

Welcome to SanDisk Corporation's Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2010 Financial Results Conference. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jay Iyer, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining us on the call today are Sanjay Mehrotra, President and CEO of SanDisk; and Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President of Administration and CFO.", "Before we begin, please note that any non-GAAP financial measures discussed during this call as defined by the SEC in Regulation G will be reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. That reconciliation is now available along with supplemental schedules on our website at sandisk.com/ir. In addition, during our call today, we will make forward-looking statements. Any statement that refers to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future event, including financial projections and future market conditions, is a forward-looking statement. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, including annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2009 and our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. SanDisk assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements which speak as of the date hereof. With that, I will turn the call over to Sanjay.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon, everyone. The fourth quarter was another strong period for SanDisk, reflecting solid execution from every growth in the company driving excellent business results. Secular demand drivers from the mobile markets, coupled with our increasing success in diversifying our customer base, helped us achieve year-over-year revenue growth of 35% in 2010. The scale of our business continues to expand at a rapid rate with overall unit volume approaching the $600 million units per year level. Our technology leadership enabled a 46% year-over-year cost decline, well exceeding the price decline rates, and with continued prudent expense management, 2010 was the most profitable year in the company's history.", "For our industry, the drivers for NAND flash demand has never been stronger. The increasing adoption of Smartphone with the high-capacity flash storage remains a key demand driver for NAND, and this end market will be the primary growth engine for SanDisk in 2011. ", "In addition, the anticipated launch of numerous tablet models from several OEMs is establishing an exciting new product category that relies on NAND flash as its storage solution. Furthermore, we believe Apple\u2019s latest Mac Book Air is likely to re-define the concept of mobile computing and the established view of notebook computers. NAND flash memory is a key enabling storage technology for these thin form factor devices which are designed for better responsiveness, high reliability, lightweight and ruggedness, with long battery life. In addition to Smartphones and tablets, consumer devices such as gaming systems and internet-enabled television are in the early stages of embedding NAND flash as part of their system architectures, and we are very pleased to be deeply involved in those ecosystems.", "Switching topics to supply, the industry began adding wafer capacity starting in the second half of 2010 to meet the growing demand from multiple end markets anticipated over the next several years. For 2011, given third-party estimates for supply growth and the demand growth drivers I previously described, we expect a healthy balance between demand and supply for the industry in 2011. ", "For SanDisk, on our third quarter earnings call, we said that we had not made a decision on the timing of Fab 5 startup. Based on our future demand projections, we have now decided to move forward with Fab 5, and we plan to begin ramping the new facility starting in the third quarter of 2011. Regarding Fab 4, the final phase of capacity expansion is progressing well, and the facility will be operating at its full capacity by mid-2011. SanDisk's combined capacity from the three 300-millimeter facilities, Fab 3, 4 and 5, is expected to provide a big supply increase in line with the industry in 2011. The incremental contribution from Fab 5 to our total wafer output is estimated to be less than 5% for 2011. We view our strategic capacity and technology investment as key to our long-term success, and these investments are vital to generate future returns and to enable continued leadership in our markets.", "Turning to our fourth quarter results, both our OEM and retail channels grew sequentially with OEM accounting for 59% of the product revenue. Within the OEM channel, our embedded business including iNAND remained on a solid growth trajectory, and it more than doubled on a year-over-year basis accounting for about 40% of OEM revenue in the fourth quarter. ", "The design win pipeline for our iNAND product line is in excellent shape, and iNAND is not only gaining greater acceptance in Smartphones but in several tablet models as well. To size the opportunity, more than 200 Smartphones and other devices have already designed in our iNAND solution, and this designed-in volume has more than doubled since last year. ", "Furthermore, the usage mix of our three bits per cell memory in iNAND continues to grow, and we believe we have the distinction of being the only company to be successfully implementing X3 memory in embedded application. With regard to solid state drive, or SSD, we are advancing our product roadmap and have recently strengthened our resources and leadership team in this area. In our retail channel, we are pleased with our overall Q4 results, and we saw a strong sequential growth in North America for the holiday season.", "For the year, we made substantial gains in the Asia Pacific region, particularly in India and China, as many of the initiatives we put in place during 2009 began to pay off. Our retail product line continues to evolve and build upon our long history of providing industry-leading products. Just three weeks ago, we announced a 128-gigabyte SanDisk Extreme Pro CompactFlash card which is the world's fastest high-capacity professional imaging card available in the market today. ", "From a manufacturing standpoint in 2010, our 32-nanometer technology was the production workhorse, and we continued to have high usage of our three bits per cell architecture in a broad array of products. The 46% cost reduction we achieved in 2010 was primarily enabled by these two key technologies, and we believe we have strong cost leadership in the NAND flash memory industry. Looking forward to 2011, our primary cost-reduction driver will be the currently ramping 24-nanometer technology deployed on both 2- and 3-bits-per-cell architectures. Let me quickly update you on our efforts to drive innovation.", "If you recall, we have been working with the mobile network operator (MNO) community for some time to develop product solutions that enhance their subscriber's mobile usage experiences. I'm pleased to report that we are now supplying our service discovery cards, or SDC, to MNO. In particular, on December 20, we announced the card-based secured media solution with network -connected flash memory for Cricket Communication to support its differentiated mobile offering called Muve Music. ", "To summarize, 2010 was an excellent year for SanDisk. Having established a strong foothold, we entered 2011 highly energized, with excellent technology, broad solutions, and deepening customer relationships. Our market share position is growing in OEM and remains #1 in worldwide retail, and you will see us continue to build upon our strong globally-recognized brand. ", "Our focus in 2011 will be to expand further into the emerging economies, drive higher usage of our X3 memory in embedded applications, and address the emerging SSD market, all supported by a compelling technology and product roadmap. I'm confident that our vision, passion and dedicated team of talented employees will help us achieve our goals. We plan to expand further on many of these topics at our Analyst Day meeting in February, and I look forward to meeting you then. ", "With that, I will turn the call over to Judy.", "Judy Bruner", "Thank you, Sanjay. We are very pleased to report record quarterly and annual revenue. Our fourth quarter revenue of $1.33 billion grew 8% sequentially and 7% year-over-year, and came in at the top of the range we estimated in October, benefiting from solid demand in both our retail and OEM channels.  Our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating margin was 29%. And for the full year 2010, we delivered our most profitable year ever, with non-GAAP operating margin of 32% and non-GAAP net income of $1.1 billion, more than 2x the previous high in 2006.", "In Q4, our gigabytes sold increased a strong 30% sequentially, with very similar growth in both the retail and OEM channels. Our ASP per gigabyte declined 15% sequentially with a lower decline in the retail channels and a higher decline within OEM, driven by significant growth in OEM average capacity. Our sequential growth in average capacity was 21% and was higher in OEM than in retail.", "Our fourth quarter retail revenue was up 17% sequentially with the strongest growth in the U.S. region. On a year-over-year basis, our Q4 retail revenue was flat with strong growth in Asia, modest growth in the U.S. and a decline in Europe. We believe the year-over-year decline in our Europe retail sales reflects both the weak economic environment in Europe, as well as SanDisk pulling back from certain low priced deals in that region. ", "Our OEM fourth quarter revenue grew 4% sequentially and 16% year-over-year. And as Sanjay pointed out, we had a strong shift in our OEM mix to embedded solutions. Our 2010 revenue of $4.8 billion grew 35% over 2009 and was made up of an increase in gigabytes sold of 74% and a year-over-year price decline of 19%. Our 2010 OEM revenue grew 75% from 2009 and our 2010 retail revenue grew 8%.", "OEM revenue represented 62% of our 2010 product revenue. Our revenue mix for 2010 by end market was 50% from the mobile phone market, 22% from imaging, 9% USB, 11% from other end markets and 8% from license and royalty. Our non-GAAP product gross margin for the fourth quarter was 40%, inclusive of an $18 million charge related to a power outage experienced in Fabs 3 and 4 in the fourth quarter. This charge includes the cost of scrapped wafers, the costs to bring the fabs back online and the fixed costs incurred while the fabs were down and not producing wafers. Excluding the impact of the power outage, costs were as expected and included an increase in non-captive memory to approximately 5% of our shipments and an unfavorable sequential movement in the yen to dollar exchange rate embedded in our cost of sales.", "Our fourth quarter cost per gigabyte improved sequentially by 3%, including the impact of the power outage, increased non-captive usage and the yen exchange rate. Our full year 2010 underlying cost per gigabyte improvement of 46%, which includes a 7% unfavorable annual movement in exchange rate, as well as power outage and non-captive costs highlights how successful we were this year in our 32-nanometer transition and our consistently high usage of X3 memory.", "Our Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses of $195 million were lower than we had forecasted, primarily due to the timing of certain R&D expenses that are now expected in 2011. For the full year 2010, our non-GAAP operating expenses were 15% of revenue, and we achieved non-GAAP operating margin of 32%.", "Fourth quarter non-GAAP other income of $13 million included $5.4 million of gains from the sale of certain investments. Our non-GAAP tax rate for Q4 decreased to 22.9%, benefiting from certain onetime favorable adjustments, as well as the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the full year 2010 of 32% included slightly more than a one-point benefit from onetime favorable adjustments. ", "I'm sure you've noticed that our GAAP tax rate for 2010 is approximately 11%. This is due to the Q4 release of the valuation allowance we have been carrying against our deferred tax assets since the fourth quarter of 2008. The release of this allowance reflects both our strong profitability in 2010 and our expectations for continued profitability.", "On the balance sheet, cash and short and long term marketable securities increased sequentially by $292 million to more than $5.3 billion. Deducting the maturity value of our convertible debt securities, our net cash stands at $3.2 billion. Our Q4 cash flow from operations was $359 million, and we invested $60 million in the Fab 4 joint venture and $48 million in non-fab capital purchases.", "For the full year 2010, we generated over $1.45 billion of cash flow from operations, more than twice the previous high in 2007, and we generated free cash flow of $1.36 billion. For 2010, our non-fab capital investments were $108 million and our share of joint ventures Fab investments was $944 million, for total capital investment of $1.05 billion. Our Fab joint venture investments required zero net cash investment from SanDisk in 2010, due primarily to the use of Fab joint venture working capital. However, there will be some SanDisk cash contributions required in 2011, related to tools installed in the latter part of 2010.", "I'll now turn to forward-looking commentary. Please note that non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation tables for all applicable guidance are posted on our website.", "For the first quarter, we expect our retail demand to be lower sequentially due to normal seasonality, and in our OEM channels, demand continues to grow. We expect to be supply constrained for the first quarter, in part due to the fourth quarter power outage. We anticipate that price decline in Q1 will be relatively modest, including the impact of moving to higher average capacity. We forecast our Q1 total revenue to be between $1.20 billion and $1.275 billion, including license and royalty revenue similar to the fourth quarter.", "For the full year 2011, we expect our captive gigabyte growth to be in line with industry growth, and we also expect to utilize a modest amount of non-captive supply to meet our customer demand. We are forecasting healthy supply demand balance in the industry in 2011, and we currently expect that that will equate to price decline being somewhat higher in 2011 than in 2010. Our revenue forecast for 2011 is $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion, including license and royalty revenues similar to slightly higher than in 2010.", "Turning to gross margin, for the first quarter, we expect our product gross margin percentage to be similar to the fourth quarter, including the impact of utilizing some non-captive supply.", "In forecasting our gross margins for Q2 through Q4, the key factors include pricing, the ramp rate of our 24-nanometer technology, the level of non-captive purchases, Fab 5 start up costs, and the yen to the dollar exchange rate. In terms of the yen to dollar exchange rate, we have locked in the yen exchange rate for approximately half of our 2011 wafer purchases. Based on those hedges plus our forecast of future rates, we expect the yen to have an unfavorable impact on our costs in 2011 relative to 2010, thus putting some pressure on our gross margin.", "In addition, we will incur Fab 5 start up costs in cost of sales during 2011 with the heaviest period being Q3 and Q4. In terms of non-captive purchases, we plan to continue utilizing these purchases throughout 2011 in order to profitably balance supply to demand, and at the same time, ramp Fab 5 at a prudent rate. We expect this will result in more non-captive purchases in 2011 than in 2010 when we purchased nothing in the first half of the year and very little in the third quarter. Combining these factors, we forecast our non-GAAP product gross margin for the full year 2011 to be in the range of 35% to 38%, which is at the high-end of or above our long-term financial model. Adding in our License and Royalty revenue yields a total non-GAAP gross margin forecast for 2011 of 39% to 42%.", "Our primary operating expense investments in 2011 will be in R&D and will include Fab 5 start up costs as well as technology investment in 1X nanometer NAND and beyond. The Fab 5 start up costs in R&D are expected to be heavier in the first half of the year than in the second half, whereas other technology as well as marketing costs are forecasted to be higher in the second half of the year. ", "We expect that our total non-GAAP operating expenses will be approximately $850 million spread relatively evenly across the year. This puts our 2011 non-GAAP OpEx at the low-end to middle of our long-term financial model of 15% to 17% of revenue, inclusive of the start up costs. We expect our non-GAAP other income for 2011 to be approximately $30 million, spread fairly evenly across the year. This is lower than last year because 2010 benefited from over $30 million of gain from the sale of certain investments, and also because 2011 carries a full year of interest expense on the convertible debt issued in August 2010. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate for 2011 to be 33%.", "Relative to our diluted share count for 2011, keep in mind that from an accounting perspective, we will begin to include additional shares in our diluted share count when the stock trades above the $52 strike price of our recent convertible issuance even though we have bond hedges that are expected to offset dilution below $73 per share upon ultimate maturity or conversion.", "Our 2011 capital investment forecast for Fab and non-Fab purchases is between $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion, including the remaining expansion of Fab 4 and the initial ramp of Fab 5. These investments will be financed through a combination of leases, joint venture working capital and cash. I will provide further details on our capital spending and our funding plans at our February Analyst Day. ", "In summary, our fourth quarter and 2010 results were outstanding, and we believe we are well-positioned for a strong 2011. We will now open the call for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take the first question today from Daniel Amir, Lazard Capital Markets.", "Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "In terms of the guidance, can you give us a little more clarity on the OEM market? It seems like it's reacting much better than seasonal trends. So what are you currently seeing there? I mean, is it in specific end market? Is it more on the embedded side?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "In the OEM market, we are seeing a growth in the Smartphone, as well as for 2011 in the tablet category. And of course, the Legacy market of imaging and USB drives, et cetera, continue to be a stronghold as well. In embedded, particularly in the mobile embedded-led opportunities, we are gaining share, and our products are doing very well. As I indicated, that's becoming a larger part of our overall OEM business.", "Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "And then, one follow-up. In terms of the power outage, what type of impact did that have in Q4 and going into Q1 in terms of the impact on margins and potentially on revenues here as you seem like to be somewhat supply constrained?", "Judy Bruner", "In terms of the impact on the fourth quarter, Daniel, it was really the $18 million charge that I described. It really did not impact revenue in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, our available supply is reduced by something less than 10% relative to the Power outage. And we're making up for some of that with non-captive purchases. But it is a factor in our available supply in the first quarter.", "Operator", "Our next is Daniel Berenbaum from Auriga USA.", "Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA LLC", "Just again looking at the guidance, when you talked about Q1 ASP declines being relatively benign and then looking at 2011 being relatively worse than 2010. Can you help us put a little bit more structure around that? Just put some numbers around that?", "Judy Bruner", "We're not going to put numbers around it, but let me try to give you a little more color. We do believe that the industry in 2011 will be in a healthy supply-demand balance. And we believe that, that translates into a rate of price decline that will be somewhat higher than what the industry experienced in 2010, which was actually a quite benign rate of price decline in 2010.  And so we are expecting that it will be higher in 2011. We think it will be a healthy rate of price decline for the industry that will help stimulate further growth in demand and in new applications. And that is all built in to our guidance for revenue growth and for margins for 2011, which we think are very strong.", "Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA LLC", "So then tying into that, I mean, do you imply that -- or it seems that you think that your cost reduction is going to be a little bit less than price declines since it looks like gross margin is going down just a little bit, and I'm sorry, I just haven\u2019t worked through all the math. Is that the right way to think about it? And then you had talked last year, you talked about your long-term cost reduction per byte roadmap being 25% and 35% annually over the course of the next last couple of years. Is that still the right way to think about it?", "Judy Bruner", "I think you're thinking about it correctly, Daniel. In terms of the all in cost reduction, we believe we'll continue to be a cost leader in 2011 and that we will have very strong cost reduction. But when we factor in all the various moving parts such as the yen exchange rate and the Fab 5 start up costs and some increased usage of non-captive, those all factored into the cost reduction would result in an expectation for cost reduction to be a bit less than price decline, which then is factored into the gross margin guidance that we provided.", "Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA LLC", "So if we were just looking at your -- or if we are excluding those external factors and just looking at your cost reduction, do you think that would be ahead of price declines?", "Judy Bruner", "You know we're not going to give that kind of specificity, but we do believe that our cost reduction capability is very strong in terms of our underlying cost reduction. And the gross margin that we're arriving at is at the higher end or above our long-term financial model.", "Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA LLC", "And then one last question along those lines, something I didn't understand in the prepared commentary. You talked about ASPs being down partly due to increased shift to OEM or to higher density in OEMs. Could you give a little more clarity around that? I thought OEM was better ASPs, or what didn't I understand there?", "Judy Bruner", "Really, what I referred to was a higher growth rate in the average capacity of our OEM products. And as you move up in terms of average capacity, ASP per gigabyte does not move up exactly in correlation. It tends to be at a lower rate at the higher capacities. And so that, without an actual price decline, contributes to a somewhat lower ASP per gigabyte.", "Operator", "Our next question today comes from Craig Ellis, Caris & Company.", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "Sanjay, can you talk a little bit about the 24-nanometer transition? What some of the key milestones will be in 2011 as you go to that lower number?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We started production of 24-nanometer at the end of last year. During 2011 we will continue to ramp up 24-nanometer, convert from 32-nanometer production to 24-nanometer in our Fabs. By end of this year, we expect to be fully converted, by the December timeframe, to 24-nanometer, except for any 32-nanometer requirement that we still may have related to certain customers.", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "And then just going back to something that's very topical. On the subject of tablets, can you talk about how meaningful tablets are to the revenue stream now and as you look at the design-in pipeline, when do they begin to become much more meaningful? Is it steadily through the year, or are there any particular step-ups as we think about the next three or four quarters?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So we have a very strong engagement with leading players in the tablets market. We look at tablets as a very strong growth opportunity for us in 2011. You saw at [indiscernible] that scores of models of tablets got announced, and several of these will be heading into production over the course of first half of the year and then probably new product introductions will continue during the course of the year as well. So we really look at this as an opportunity that will be continuing to build up for us during the course of 2011.", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "And then lastly if I could Judy, you might have mentioned it in the prepared comments. if you did, I did missed it. But could you specify what the range would be for your second sourcing for this year?", "Judy Bruner", "I'm sorry, you cut out. For our what?", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "What percent of mix would be second sourced this year?", "Judy Bruner", "I did not say specifically, but I would tell you that it's probably something around 10% or less.", "Operator", "Next up, we'll hear from Uche Orji, UBS.", "Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank", "Sanjay, you talked about Fab 5 contributing 5% of capacity this year. When it is fully ramped, what will that be in terms of contributions to total capacity for SanDisk?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So what I mentioned was that Fab 5 will contribute less than 5% total wafer output for 2011 on the basis of our existing Fab 3, Fab 4 capacity. So less than 5% of our total output from Fab 3, 4 and 5 in 2011 will be coming from Fab 5. And with respect to the capacity specifically. By the end of this year, we will be reaching at our Fab 5, adding approximately 10% to our total Fab 3, Fab 4, Fab 5 capacity.", "Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank", "Just in terms of equipment availability, I know you are going to be ramping into later part of second half of this year. Are there any concerns we may have around your ability to ramp it up by equipment availability or should we just assume this is fully all locked in?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We work very closely with the equipment suppliers. And SanDisk and Toshiba together worked closely with the equipment suppliers, and we believe the equipment is available to meet our capacity NAND's requirement in Fab 5.", "Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank", "Judy, in terms of the margin structure within the embedded, as we are seeing more and more of true embedded, I have two questions here. One, is can you just kind of rank order for me the margin contribution across the various product segments? That's one. And then two. Sanjay, if you can just talk about what really -- it looks like iNAND is getting more and more traction. Did I hear you correctly say you had -- how many Smartphone did you mention? I'm not sure I heard it correctly. And if you can just talk what you bring especially into the market space that has allowed you to be ramped in the last, I would say, in the last six months, probably what I've been monitoring. It looks like something to have clicked in terms of your ability to ramp this. So anything can be helpful here.", "Judy Bruner", "Let me start out. What I would tell you is that in recent periods, the gross margins of our Retail business have outstripped the gross margins of our OEM segment of our business. And that is primarily because we have such high usage of our X3 memory in the retail part of our business. In OEM, usage of X3 to date in the embedded part of our OEM business has been relatively lower, but we are making progress and penetrating the embedded solutions with our extreme memory and we expect to continue to make progress across 2011 in using X3 in embedded solutions. But we really managed our gross margins in terms of the overall blended portfolio, and we're very pleased with the overall gross margin performance for 2010 clearly, as well as with our guidance for 2011.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So regarding your question on Embedded Products and our success and the key factors in that regard. Let me first point out that our Embedded Products include iNAND, as well as other components. And these Embedded Products are certainly going into Smartphone, but categories such as tablets and other mobile devices as well. What I referred to in my prepared remarks was more than 200 models of various mobile devices that our Embedded Products are designed in. Not only Smartphone, but other mobile devices in the ecosystem of consumer devices as well. Regarding iNAND, we have spoken to it  for a long time that our systems strength of having really the controller expertise, together with the flash memory, really comes into strong play for embedded opportunities because it helps us understand the user application, the usage models in the end device platforms and tweak, if you will, our iNAND products to really optimize the performance of the storage solution in the end application. We have spoken about Adaptive Flash Management techniques in the past, and basically, those helped us really then several of these designs because we are able to deliver high-performance, as well as high quality and reliability with our solutions. So we believe that eMMC 4.41 in the iNAND product is really a leadership product and best of specifications in the market. And of course, we continue to engage on an ongoing basis with the chipset vendors, as well as the handset providers in the mobile ecosystem and other device manufacturers as well in the ecosystem to continue to look at the next generation opportunities and to continue to advance our product offerings to gain further on these designs and momentum.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tristan Gerra, Robert Baird.", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "You mentioned that outsourcing will be around 10% or less for the whole year. Is there any quarter where it's going to be above 10%?", "Judy Bruner", "We're really not going to guide to that on a specific quarterly basis at this point. Our usage of non-captive across the year will depend upon demand trends as they unfold across the year. Our current expectation is that we'll use something up to 10%.", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Could you provide a breakdown on the gross margin for yen exchange, fab outage, and long types of usage through the quarter?", "Jay Iyer", "Tristan, I think you should repeat the question, we didn't catch it.", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "I may have missed it, but did you provide a breakdown on your gross margin for the quarter as well as yen exchange and all also the fab outage?", "Judy Bruner", "I did say that the power outage resulted in an $18 million charge to the fourth quarter. So you can calculate that, that is close to a 1.5 point impact on the gross margins. And in terms of the yen exchange rate, I didn't mention that, but I'll tell you that the underlying yen exchange rate in our cost of sales in the fourth quarter moved an unfavorable approximately six percentage points, relative to the third quarter. I'm talking six percentage movement in the yen exchange rate, not in the gross margin percentage.", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "And are you able to provide the rules of guidance in terms of the iNAND as percentage of your Embedded business? Have you had any kind of high-level target?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "INAND is a strong mix of our total Embedded business but we are not going to break out iNAND versus the other components. I did provide you that our Embedded Products contributed 40% of our OEM revenue in the fourth quarter as well as the increased from 30% in the third quarter.", "Operator", "Next up is Bob Gujavarty, Deutsche Bank.", "Bobby Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank AG", "I just had a question about the non-captive capacity. Given some tightness and balanced supply and demand, do you anticipate any difficulty in getting as much non-captive as you like or is that already kind of arranged?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We have strong [indiscernible] in place for procuring non-captive supply. Of course, we manage it during the course of the year as we determine our needs, but we are pretty confident that we will be able to procure the non-captive supply to meet the requirements that Judy earlier mentioned.", "Bobby Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank AG", "And Judy, can you just remind me, isn\u2019t a yen about a 10% move and the dollar yen is about a one percentage point impact to gross margin? Is that the correct ratio, or do I have it wrong?", "Judy Bruner", "No, the impact is more than that. What we've typically said is that a five percentage move in the yen can cause about a two- to three-point movement in the gross margin percentage.", "Operator", "Atif Malik, Morgan Stanley has the next question.", "Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley", "Can you tell us the Toshiba shutdown? How much did it affect your own shipments in Q4?", "Judy Bruner", "You're talking about the power outage?", "Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley", "Right.", "Judy Bruner", "It really did not affect our revenue in the fourth quarter. And as I said, we think that it will have an impact on -- or it does have an impact on, our available supply in the first quarter of something less than 10%.", "Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley", "And then what would've been the cost-reduction excluding the outage?  You said including it was like 3% cost reduction?", "Judy Bruner", "Yes, it would have been something like around 5% cost reduction. But of course, that is also impacted by the yen exchange rate. So a lot of different moving parts in the cost per gigabyte reduction in the fourth quarter, as well as next year.", "Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley", "And what was MLC/TLC mix exiting last year?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "For 2010, our X3 3-bit per cell mix was more than 50%.", "Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley", "If I look at your history of cost reduction in the last three years, you have been very strong and you've always up sided your cost reduction targets in the 3-bit per cell or technology migration. But just according to physics, if you scale 32-nanometer wafer to a 24-nanometer, you should be able to get a 45% kind of cost reduction just doing the 24-square over 32-square. And then you have a knob of 3-bit per cell just getting embedded in OEM applications. So I mean why should we believe that the cost reduction should be less than 40% this year?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Let me just provide you some help here. When you look at scaling the technology, it is not only about scaling the flash memory cell, it is also about scaling the periphery transistors, the circuits, inside the chip. And those two tend to scale at somewhat of a different rate. When we look at 32-nanometer to a 24-nanometer, wafer comparison adds mature yields. The 24-nanometer can give you a benefit in the range of 30% to 40%. Again, at the wafer-level, with maturing on both the 32-nanometer wafer as well as 24-nanometer wafer. However, for our yearly cost reduction, as Judy pointed out, there are many factors. One of them is certainly 24-nanometer ramp up. We will be ramping up 24-nanometer during the course of the year. And other factors, of course that play a role in our overall cost reduction are the non-captive supply, as well as Fab 5 related start up costs and impact of exchange rate.", "Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley", "Should we model a linear kind of a ramp for 24-nanometer for this year?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Yes, the 24-nanometer ramp will be fairly linear during the year.", "Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley", "And Wi-Fi will start with 24 or 18?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We are not disclosing the plans for Wi-Fi at this point. As I said, the 1x technology will start late this year. Wi-Fi will start in August timeframe with production in the Q3 timeframe.", "Operator", "Next up is Hendi Susanto, Gabelli & Company.", "Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "How do you set the non-captive pricing? Like how much influence do Japanese yen and market spot price have on your non-captive  purchase? And furthermore, on an apples-to-apples basis or per gigabyte of capacity, how much impact does non-captive purchase have on the gross margin?", "Judy Bruner", "In terms of non-captive pricing, there are certain formulas available for non-captive pricing for us in our non-captive supply agreements. But I really can't go into how the yen plays into that and of course that plays into any non-captive purchases that we might make from Toshiba, but not necessarily from other suppliers. And I'm sorry, what was the second part of your question?", "Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Like on an apples-to-apples basis or on a per gigabyte of capacity, what is the difference in the gross margin between the captive and the non-captive?", "Judy Bruner", "It can vary quite a bit from period to period, but there is a substantial difference in the cost per gigabyte or the gross margin between our usage of our captive supply and our non-captive. I have said in the past that there can be up to 20 to even 30 percentage points difference between the gross margin for captive versus non-captive.", "Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "And my last question in the embedded applications, are there new markets that you are planning to pursue in 2011?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Yes. We see emerging markets for IP TV, the connective TVs for gaming devices, and these are new opportunities emerging for embedded flash solutions.", "Operator", "Next up, we'll hear from Hans Mosesmann, Raymond James.", "Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates", "Just an industry comment regarding SLC demand, which looks like it's going to be pretty strong this year on enterprise dynamics. What are the implications of stronger demand in SLC in terms of your business, which is the 2-bits-per-cell and 3-bits-per-cell and then would you consider getting into that business in some way?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So we will continue to focus on MLC and 3-bits-per-cell. That's where we have leadership, especially with solutions related to using the controller. In the enterprise market also, it's an interesting opportunity for us, and we will certainly continue to evaluate it. But a lot of the enterprise market also is starting to use MLC now as well.", "Operator", "And Kate Kotlarsky, Goldman Sachs, is up next.", "Kate Kotlarsky - Goldman Sachs", "I wanted to ask about your bit growth expectations for this year. Sanjay, I believe you had mentioned that assuming you only utilize your captive supply, you would be relatively in line with the industry average. Could you share with us what that number is in your mind? Is it something around 80%?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "I'll share with you is the number that's available from the third-party sources, and that number points to, for the industry supply growth, in the range of high 70s to high 80s.", "Kate Kotlarsky - Goldman Sachs", "So we should think of that number as being sort of the minimum of what you expect to grow this year from a bid growth perspective?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We are not providing any specific guidance, but we will be in the range as well.", "Kate Kotlarsky - Goldman Sachs", "And then can I also ask what your current plans are for 4-bits-per-cell or X4 going forward?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "In 24-nanometer, as well as in 32-nanometer, all of our production has been and will be 2-bit per cell and 3-bit per cell technology. We are not producing 4-bits-per-cell in these technology nodes. But of course, a lot of the techniques that we learned from 4-bits-per-cell we are able to apply them to 3-bit-per-cell products, and those are some of the techniques that actually end up giving our 3-bit-per -cell products superior performance and functionality and application compared to others 2-bits-per-cell products.", "Kate Kotlarsky - Goldman Sachs", "I was wondering if you could tell us what percentage of your OEM business this quarter was white label in the Wafer business? I know that it was a minimal amount in Q3, and I believe that was expected to increase this quarter. So I was just hoping you could share that with us.", "Judy Bruner", "Kate, no, we're not really going to break out that level of granularity on our OEM business. As we've said, 40% of our OEM business was embedded, and then the rest of it would be Card business as well as some Wafer and Component business.", "Operator", "Next up is Vijay Rakesh, Sterne Agee.", "Kate Kotlarsky - Goldman Sachs", "Just wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on the 24-nanometer side. How do you see that ramping here now that it is starting to ramp there?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Regarding 24-nanometer, it could be ramping during the course of the year. And we started it late last year, and it will complete transition by the end of the year. And as I said before, if we complete it by the end of the year except for any 32-nanometer that we will acquire for certain OEMs.", "Kate Kotlarsky - Goldman Sachs", "So should we assume it's more like a -- between 15%, 20% range in the first quarter and then kind of grow linear into the year?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "The transition will occur linearly during the course of the year.", "Kate Kotlarsky - Goldman Sachs", "On the TLC, on the 3-bits-per-cell, what proportion of your output is on 3-bit now?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "In 2010, we had more than 50% of our bit production on 3-bits-per-cell. Similarly in 2011 as well.", "Kate Kotlarsky - Goldman Sachs", "And on the Toshiba Fab 4, will it be fully subsidized by end of Q2, is that right?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Yes, we have said before that, that Fab 4 will be fully facilitized by mid this year. Yes.", "Kate Kotlarsky - Goldman Sachs", "And how much capacity does that add in the first half from Fab 4?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "What we have said before, it still applies. Which is once Fab 4 is fully facilitized, our total production output from Fab 3 and Fab 4 combined will be at the rate of 2 billion wafers per year.", "Operator", "There are no further questions in the queue.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you. Thank you, Lisa. We want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. As a reminder, our 2011 Financial Analyst Meeting will be held on February 24, and we hope to see you then.

Welcome to Western Digital's Third Quarter Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2011. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.", "Bob Blair", "Thank you. I want to mention that we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments in response to your questions concerning benefits expected from our planned acquisition of Hitachi GST, industry conditions in the June quarter including the total available market for hard drives, customer demand, supply constraints, capacity mix, average selling price and cost of components, our presence in the traditional enterprise market, our expected capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2011.", "The terms of and our ability to syndicate our new credit facility to be entered into in connection with our planned acquisition of HGST, and our financial results expectations for the June quarter including revenue gross margin, expenses, tax rate, share count and earnings per share. ", "These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on January 28, 2011. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events, and you should not assume later in the quarter that the comments we make today are still valid. ", "In addition, references will be made during this call to historical non-GAAP financial measures as well as forward-looking estimates of non-GAAP financial measures that give effect to our planned acquisition of HGST. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures in our press release and investor summary, included as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, respectively for the Form 8-K, we have furnished to the SEC today. Copies of which can be found under the SEC filings link in the investors relations section of our website. ", "The forward-looking estimates of non-GAAP financial measures that give effect to our planned acquisition of Hitachi GST exclude acquisition-related expenses that we expect to incur in connection with the transaction. And following the closing of the transaction. Because these acquisition related items will not be known to us until on or after the closing of the transaction, we are unable to provide information about or reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures. ", "Finally, as a reminder, until our acquisition of Hitachi GST closes, WD and HGST remain independent companies, so we will not be taking any questions about HGST's business nor its financial performance. I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the investors section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of this call. I will now turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, John Coyne.", "John Coyne", "Thank you, Bob. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me on our Q3 call are Tim Leyden, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wolfgang Nickl, our Chief Financial Officer. ", "First and foremost, we were pleased to determine in early March that Western Digital employees in Japan, as well as those of Hitachi GST were all safe after the tragic events of last month. Those personally affected by these events continue to be in our thoughts. ", "Like many technology companies, we have been busy dealing with the disruptions resulting from the events in Japan. We are also proceeding on plan with our acquisition of HGST and have made significant progress on that front. We are in the approval process with all required regulatory agencies. Our integration planning is well underway and we have successfully syndicated the loan financing associated with the transaction. We remain very excited about the potential of this acquisition. ", "Industry shipments came in at 160 million units for the March quarter, slightly above our original expectation of 155 million units. As customers accelerated product purchases in the last 3 weeks the quarter due to supply concerns as a result of the Japanese earthquake. Analyzing the effects of the events in Japan, on the technology industry generally, there were, and remain a number of supply chain challenges, which are impacting both demand and supply visibility in the June quarter and beyond.  ", "Tim will describe these in more detail. But I am pleased that the WD team with strong support from our suppliers, has mitigated the initial impact on our ability to support pre-earthquake customer share awards for the June quarter. We have now turned our attention to responding to customer upside requests for this quarter, which we believe are driven by unresolved supply chain issues at competitors and to fully supporting customer needs in the September quarter. We believe end customer demand for the June quarter in all markets for HDDs is tracking to seasonally normal patterns. ", "However, there is uncertainty around the ability of our customers and the HDD industry to fully satisfy this demand due to supply chain challenges. In uncertain times like these, we believe a highly flexible and responsive WD business model is especially well-equipped to perform and deliver value to our customers and shareholders. ", "I will now turn the call over to COO, Tim Leyden, who will describe the operational challenges and highlights in the March quarter in greater detail. Tim?", "Timothy Leyden", "Thank you, John. Entering the March quarter, we aligned our business with the 155 million unit TAM that we have forecasted in the January earnings call. Responding to the unexpected increase in TAM, triggered by the series of uncertain supply in the last few weeks of the quarter, our adaptable model enabled us to react rapidly to the upturn in demand and satisfy the actual TAM of 160 million units. ", "Price declines for the quarter were broadly as we had expected. Overall product capacity mix was relatively flat with tight cost management enabled us to come in at the high-end of our implied gross margin guidance. We shipped 49.8 million units in the March quarter, down 4.6% sequentially and 2.5% from the year ago period. While the overall market declined by 4.8%, and 2.3%, respectively. ", "Revenues totaled $2.25 billion. Gross margin was at 18.2% and we remain solidly profitable with net income of $146 million. We generated strong cash flow from operations of $313 million. ", "Now turning to the overall market. In the compute space, units decreased sequentially from 116 million to 112 million. And decreased year-on-year from 119 million. We believe that the softer demand in the March quarter was driven to some extent by the late supply of CPUs to PC ODMs. Commercial demand strength continued, while consumer demand remained subdued. ", "Against this backdrop, WD shipped 36.3 million units into the compute space in the March quarter, compared to 37.8 million units in the December quarter, and 38.5 million units in the year ago quarter, as we maintained essentially flat market share in all three periods.", "And the airline enterprise market was up sequentially from 5.4 million to 5.6 million units, and up from 5.2 million units year-on-year. Driven by the expansion of cloud computing, this market continues to offer further growth opportunity. The traditional enterprise market at 8.3 million units remained flat with the December quarter, and was up year-on-year from 7.4 million units, reflecting the continued strength of the commercial market. ", "The shift to 2.5-inch SaaS continued, as a percentage of total market represented by this platform has now advanced to around 54% of the TAM. WD shipped 2.3 million units into the combined enterprise markets in the March quarter. ", "Essentially flat with the December and year ago quarters. We continue to put the building blocks in place to increase our presence in the traditional enterprise space, and we're shipping out second-generation SaaS product to a limited customer set, and we continue to work on our third generation product. ", "The HDD manufacturers TAM in the branded product segment came in at 13 million units. Seasonally down from 14.7 million units in the December quarter and up from 10.7 million units in the year ago quarter, presenting continued evidence of strong demand for personal storage. ", "The seasonal cadence of this market is such that sell-in exceeds sell-through during the December quarter. In order to have adequate inventory in place for the holiday and post-holiday sales, whereas sell-through exceeds sell-in during the March quarter as distributors and retailers lighten up on inventory in preparation for the seasonally weaker June quarter. ", "WD shipped 6.4 million units into this market in the March quarter, down from 7.4 million units in the December quarter and up from 5.6 million units in the year ago quarter. We continue to compete strongly in this market segment where our brand equity, product lineup and differentiating features have earned us the leading position. ", "In the DDR market segment, the TAM was 13.5 million units, down sequentially from 14.3 million, and up from 12.1 million in the year ago quarter. WD shipped 4.7 million units into this market in the March quarter, essentially flat with the December quarter and up slightly from 4.6 million in the year ago quarter. WD's product capabilities resonates with customers in this segment, and we continue to see growth opportunities as HDDs offer the best value proposition to store and enjoy video content. ", "The remaining balance of the TAM is represented by gaming, automotive and 1.8 in strides. Inventories in the HDD supply-chain exiting the quarter were below historical run rate levels in each segment. ", "Now turning to the June quarter. We believe that in an environment absent the impact of the Japanese earthquake, that the true demand for HDDs in the compute space would follow a seasonal demand patterns, and would be flat to down from the March quarter. However, given the likely impacts, we believe that HDD TAM in the June quarter will be supply constrained. Shortages at this point appear to be more acute in 2.5-inch drives but we expect the product will also be short in the 3.5-inch form factor. ", "Assuming that customer demand is not impacted by an inability to get other components that they need to build their systems. There are multiple levels of the supply chain at which availability problems may occur, from base chemicals up to final district components. And issues at each levels are still being worked by us, our suppliers, and our customers. ", "In the meantime, our customers are ordering what they can in order to reduce the number of their individual supply concerns. We are planning around a normal June quarter demand, and we have underpinned supply to satisfy that level of unit volume. We are now looking to support our customers with upside supply in response to their request as they try to bridge shortages from other HDD suppliers. ", "As John indicated, it is in uncertain times like these that WD's flexible and responsive models and our consistency and execution enable us to serve our customers well. In our other served markets, we expect volumes in DDR to be up seasonally, branded products to be down, and enterprise segments to be flat. ", "Now turning to our product line-up. We introduced new capacities for users of consumer network storage and high speed direct detach storage. We began populating our industry-leading My Book external drives with our 3 terabyte hard drives. Creative PC professionals and MAC enthusiasts, now can utilize the 6 terabyte My Book Studio Edition II storage systems to support their ever increasing production of HD content. This 2 drive storage system has 4 interfaces, including eSATA and FireWire 800 for the fastest transfer speeds, rate capability, and Apple Time Machine compatibility. ", "Our fast My Book Live network drive with a total capacity of 3 terabytes now centralizes more media than ever before in consumers' homes. We also added functionality to our WD TV Live media players, including CinemaNow, which provides users access to new release movies and TV episodes. New Netflix features, including the ability to search for movies and get recommendations directly on users' HDTV, as well as support for enhanced audio with Dolby Digital Plus. ", "I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang Nickl for a review of our Q3 financial performance, and our outlook for the fourth quarter.", "Wolfgang Nickl", "Thank you, Tim. A summary of financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, which will be updated with our Q4 guidance after this call. Our Q3 actual results was slightly above the upper end of the guidance range we provided during our January investor call.", "Revenue for the third fiscal quarter was $2.25 billion, down 15% from the prior year and 9% sequentially. Authorized shipments totaled 49.8 million units, down 3% from the prior year period and 5% sequentially. Revenue from sales of WD TV media players, WD Life Wire Network kits and solid state drives totaled approximately $50 million, up 8% from the prior year, and down 12% from the December quarter. ", "Average hard drive selling price was approximately $45 per unit, down $6 from the year ago quarter, and $2 from the December quarter. Revenue from sales of our branded products, including WD TV and WD LiveWire products, was $441 million, down 6% from the year ago quarter and 19% sequentially. There was no single customer that comprised 10% or more of our total revenue. ", "Geographically the regions contributed roughly the same relative percentage of revenue as in the December quarter, with Asia's sales continuing to represent the majority of our revenue. From a channel perspective, retails percentage of revenue declined along seasonal expectations, while our OEM percentage increased slightly. Our gross margin for the quarter was 18.2%, down from 25.2% in the year ago quarter, and 19.2% in the December quarter. ", "The quarter-over-quarter reduction of gross margin by 100 basis points is a function of a seasonal decline in our branded products business and some cost of under absorption of our manufacturing assets due to a reduced build plan. Total R&D and SG&A spending was $252 million, including $10 million of expenses related to the planned acquisition of HGST. Excluding these acquisition-related expenses, R&D and SG&A would have totaled $242 million or 10.7% of revenue. This compares with $224 million or 8.5% of revenue in the year ago quarter, and $235 million or 9.5% of revenue in the December quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase is primarily a function of increased investments in new product development and higher incentive accruals. ", "Operating income was $158 million or 7% of revenue, including $10 million of acquisition-related expenses. Non-GAAP operating income was $168 million or 7.5% of revenue. This compares with $441 million or 16.7% of revenue in the year ago quarter and $240 million or 9.7% of revenue in the December quarter. ", "Net interest and other nonoperating income was $1 million. Tax expense for the March quarter was $13 million or 8.2% of pretax income. Our net income totaled $146 million or $0.62 per share, including $10 million of acquisition-related expenses. Non-GAAP net income totaled $156 million or $0.66 per share. This compares with $400 million or $1.71 per share and $225 million or $0.96 per share in the year ago and December quarters respectively. ", "Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash conversion cycle for the March quarter was a positive 2 days. This consisted of 47 days of receivables, 28 days of inventory, or 13 terms, and 73 days of payables. We generated $313 million in cash flow from operations during the March quarter, and our free cash flow totaled $138 million. Capital expenditures for the March quarter totaled $175 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter totaled $151 million. ", "We have lowered our forecast for capital expenditures and depreciation. We now expect our capital spending for the current fiscal year to be between $775 million and $800 million, including approximately $100 million for our 6- to 8-inch wafer conversion and some smaller expenditure to optimize the output from our Singapore media facility we acquired last year. ", "Depreciation and amortization is now expected to be about $610 million for the current fiscal year. For fiscal year 2012, we are planning carryover spending of up to $100 million for 6- to 8-inch wafer conversion in Singapore media facility optimization. We made $25 million of debt repayment installments during the third quarter and thereby reduced our debt balance to $325 million. We exited fiscal Q3 with cash and cash equivalents of $3.2 billion, an increase of $120 million from the December quarter. ", "Before I talk about our Q4 guidance, let me update you on the progress we made on the debt financing related to our planned acquisition of HGST. The cash portion of the purchase price will come from available offshore cash and new debt. Our existing term loan will be repaid from available cash balances. The new debt will not be rated but will have terms similar to investment rate debt and covenants that are very similar to what we have now.", "The new credit facility will consist of a term loan of up to $2.5 billion, and a $500 million revolving line of credit. We've fully negotiated the definitive loan documents with the Syndicate members and subject to customary closing conditions, including completion of the acquisition in accordance with its terms, we fully expect all of the Syndicate members to be part of the final lender group. ", "The term loan and any amount drawn under the line of credit will carry an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin that is based on our leverage ratio. We currently expect that margin to be 200 basis points. ", "Undrawn amounts on the revolver will carry a commitment fee of about 35 basis points, which will also vary according to our leverage ratio. The debt will not be funded until the acquisition closes. But we will be paying ticking fees on the $3 billion commitment at an annualized rate of 35 basis points between now and then. The loan will have a 5-year term with half of the principal being paid quarterly over that period and the other half being paid at maturity. ", "Let me now turn to our expectation for fiscal Q4. Absent the impact from the earthquake in Japan, we believe demand would have been flat to slightly down in line with historical seasonality. However, there are several factors that could alter that pattern, including our belief that hard drive suppliers will struggle to meet customer demand. Customers are still in discovery mode to establish which components may limit their ability to service their system-level customers. ", "If hard drives prove to be the bottleneck, we will be able to ship everything we can build. We estimate significant progress stabilizing our supply, and are confident that we can supply our customers what we committed to them prior to March '11. We expect better than seasonal capacity mix-up, moderate price declines and some cost increases", "for parts substitution and expedite charges. ", "Despite the fact that we're currently above our OpEx model, we continue to invest in our branded products portfolio, solid-state initiatives and fundamental technology capabilities. Our guidance does not include acquisition and financing related costs. ", "Based on these assumptions, our guidance for fiscal Q4 is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range from $2.2 billion to $2.25 billion; R&D and SG&A spending of approximately $245 million, excluding acquisition-related expenses; we expect our tax rate to be in the middle of our business model range of 6% to 9%; we anticipate our share count to be approximately 238 million; we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $0.60 and $0.65 for the June quarter, which excludes acquisition-related expenses. ", "Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC", "Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen. So just a couple of questions for me. I guess first, when it comes to the Hitachi acquisition, I haven't been able to find a signed purchase agreement. Is that out there today? Is it something that we need to wait for, or am I just missing it?", "John Coyne", "It will be in the 10-Q, Rich.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC", "Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then, in terms of obviously Seagate's announcement about Samsung, do you expect this in any way to change how you talk about the deal with regulators? Or any comments on that?", "John Coyne", "Basically, no. We developed our transaction based on our belief that it will enhance our ability to provide value to customers through enhancement of the basic technology that's required to continue to deliver a high-quality, high reliability product portfolio, enables us to expand that product portfolio. The scale of the combined operations generates cost leverage and efficiencies, which we intend to share with our customers, and so we continue to be convinced that the acquisition of HGST is a very positive thing for WD's customers, for WD's employees, suppliers, and shareholders.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC", "Okay and then the last question for me, just on Intel. Intel talked last night, continuing to refute some of the industry analysts' forecast on PCs. Saying that they still expect low double-digit growth for the entire industry. Do you have any revised color on what you're seeing or your discussions with the OEMs relative to that?", "John Coyne", "I think, Rich -- I think I mentioned in the last call my belief that the drive industry got a little ahead of itself in calendar year 2010 and shipped more product than the actual end demand consumer and commercial user level justified. And that likewise the PC industry also put a little too much inventory into the channel, particularly in consumer in the latter half of 2010. And that consequently, while the drive industry had 18% growth in 2010, over 2009, that I expected mid single-digit to high single-digit growth in the current year. And if you balance those two numbers, you would get a 2-year growth rate in the 10% to 12% level. I think that commentary is still valid. We believe that true end consumer demand, whether commercial or personal, continues to be in the range that Intel are reflecting in their commentary.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks. Good afternoon. Your OEM customers have obviously seen the news of the HGST asset purchase. What insights, if any, have you garnered from the conversations you've had with your customers about being able to maintain market share of the combined business once the deal is done? Obviously you maintained compute shares this quarter, so it doesn't seem like there's been a disruption to date.", "John Coyne", "Yes, generally, our customer reaction in our conversations with customers immediately after we announced the acquisition of HGST has been very positive. I believe that the compelling value that they see in the deal is our ability to underpin the technology on a go-forward basis. Our ability to continue to innovate in terms of products useful to their future directions and the increased scale that will allow us to generate further cost benefits, and our willingness that we've exhibited over the last 10 years and will continue to do so to share those cost reductions with our customers to enable them to grow their markets. So very positive reaction.", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Just one follow-up on your commentary about March and June, given your customers are already coming to you and asking for upside, can you help us understand what WD's typical strategy is in those discussions? Do you plan to offer that incremental product at a higher price? Do you ask them for guaranteed orders for the back half of the year? Are there any concessions that you can get from your customers given your ability to supply them the upside this quarter?", "John Coyne", "Obviously, we have been working with customers over many, many years to develop strong partnership relationships and a significant and key value that WD has brought to that table is our flexible and responsive model, and the consistency of our ability to overcome challenges and consistently deliver a high-quality product in a timely manner. That is one of the key values that has driven the WD share growth over the last 10 years. And our posture is to continue to deliver that value. Obviously, where that requires incremental cost, like all good partnerships, we want that to be a 2-way thing. Continuous price reduction in the marketplace is an ability we have to reduce prices is driven by an ability to consistently reduce cost. So where cost reduction takes a backseat to securing availability such as securing more expensive components, being involved in more expensive transport costs to expedite, paying expedite fees, those kinds of things we share with our customers typically. And they value our ability to deliver the product. And are therefore, willing to address those cost issues.", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "John Coyne", "That's as much color as I can give you.", "Operator", "Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Hi guys, thanks very much. I had a question on inventories and the implications. What do you think the OEM inventory status is of hard drives at present? And if you mention that folks are trying to catch up here, what do you think it implies for sequential growth patterns as supplies free up presumably in the September quarter? But how should we be thinking about a little further out in the June quarter in terms of the TAM growth as we look at September. Thanks.", "Timothy Leyden", "Okay, Keith, this is Tim. When we exited on the December quarter, we estimated that the OEMs had about 8 million to 10 million units in their inventory. Then during the course of the quarter, as we went through the CPU shortage, we think that they had reduction down to around 6 million to 8 million units. And then as we got into the March portion of the quarter, we believe that they built that back up to around 8 million to 10 million units as they got a bit concerned about supply. So we think that they finished up pretty much where they started at the beginning of the quarter. And then, when we look at the profile for the balance of the year, we believe there will be a supply constraint in both June quarter and in the September quarter. We think that in the December quarter, we'll be able to supply pretty much what the industry -- what the customers demand. So we think that the comfort level as far as inventory in the pipeline will not be able to be reached again until this quarter next year, the March quarter of next year.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "So you think you'll be supply-constrained all the way to the end of December?", "Timothy Leyden", "We think we'll be supply-constrained in June and September, and then we think we'll be pretty much on equilibrium basis relative to what the customers want and what we can supply in the December quarter.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Fair enough. And then I'll sneak one more and if I can, against that -- you had some discussions about what you thought the TAM would be for calendar year '11 as we exited calendar year '10, I was just wondering if you might update us on thoughts there about what you think the TAM then looks like for calendar year '11?", "Timothy Leyden", "Yes, I think given what I just said. We had 160 pretty much 160 in the current quarter. I think the next two quarters will be somewhere around 155 each. And then we think that probably around 185 or so in the December quarter, so we think that given that profile, it'll be a supply constrained TAM and it'll be about 655 versus what the 650 in the last calendar year.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, I will see the floor. Many thanks, guys. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Rob Cihra with Caris & Company.", "Robert Cihra - Caris & Company", "Thanks very much. Two quick questions, if that's all right. The first, just that $10 million non-GAAP expense in the quarter, was that all in SG&A or was that in any of that in R&D?", "John Coyne", "Yes, it was all in SG&A.", "Robert Cihra - Caris & Company", "All SG&A. Okay, thanks. The other question would be just if you look at your, without getting into specifics of timing or anything, but to look at your sort of call it 1 terabyte per product [ph] desktop and 500 gig notebook and your cycles or industry cycles this year, is there any reason to think that those roadmaps change or impacted by either Japan and/or your HGST deal? Thanks.", "John Coyne", "Given the information that we have right now, we don't believe so.", "Robert Cihra - Caris & Company", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Scott Craig with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Scott Craig", "Yes, thanks, good afternoon. A couple of questions. Wolfgang, maybe can you talk a little bit about the gross margin for the quarter. When you look at it on a quarter-to-quarter basis, I know you guys don't provide official guidance but if we backed into it for last quarter, you come out with a midpoint you upside a surprise versus your guidance essentially so maybe talk about the moving parts there. And the second part of my question is, as you're looking at the CapEx priorities and you've taken it down a little bit, what are the odds of that having to come a little bit lower, and where are you taking CapEx out of specifically, it's obviously not on the 6- and 8-inch wafers or the Singapore media, but maybe a little bit of color around that?", "Wolfgang Nickl", "Yes, Scott. The sequential decline of gross margins from 19.2 to 18.2 are indeed a little bit better than what we had implied in our guidance. We pretty much saw the decline exactly how we had forecasted them, and again, mainly came from a segment mix, the branded businesses seasonally a bit down. And we had some absorption cost to deal with because we built fewer units in the March quarter than we did in the December quarter. And pricing overall probably came in a little bit better than we expected. I think we said on the call that we had like-for-like price declines in the model of 5%, and I would say they came in closer to 4.5%, so that's probably where the pickup came from. In terms of the CapEx, our priorities have not changed. Our capital is geared first and foremost towards ensuring our flexibility to service the market, our technology advancement, risk mitigation, and then we sold for incremental capacity. And we try to do the latter in as much as a just-in-time fashion as we can. And since volumes have come down a little bit, we're trying to be very prudent and try to invest as realtime as possible in capacity as we can.", "Operator", "Jayson Noland with Robert Baird.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Yes, thank you. Two questions. First Wolfgang, the guidance seems soft relative to the commentary about your ability to supply current OEM demand strength. Is there something I'm missing there?", "Wolfgang Nickl", "Historically, gross margin is down quarter-over-quarter in the June quarter over the March quarter. Like we said, we believe that we have underpinned the volume that we have committed. We believe that the pricing potentially driven by the swap markets is a little bit better. Price climbs are a little bit more benign than we have historically seen. So our implied margin is flat to slightly up, so we believe that is better than what we've historically seen, and our cost decline are somewhat limited because we have some increase cost due to the part substitutions that we have to do and expedite charges that we have to pay.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Okay, thank you. And last question, John, a question on Toshiba. In your opinion, are they willing and able to make significant investments?", "John Coyne", "Well, I can only refer you to their public utterances and they did put out a press release immediately after our announcement of the HGST acquisition, which indicated their belief that, that offered them significant opportunity to grow and expressed their willingness and desire to invest to accomplish that.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yes, thanks. Couple of questions, so going back to your TAM assumptions for the full year, now it's 655, I think you were previously at 700 million, can you bridge the difference in those two numbers between the effects of Japan relative to be it a slowing PC environment or any other metrics that are in that?", "Timothy Leyden", "Well since it's all supply constrained as I indicated, I indicated that we were thinking we would be supply constrained or the industry would be supply constrained, in June and September. And then only able to satisfy pretty much what the demand was in December with no inventory pipeline filling, and that indicates that it's all Japan related.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay, thank you. And then the second question, I know last quarter you guys talked about or you've been reiterating 7% to 8% of revenue for CapEx spend. Now you're saying 775 to 800, can you tell us how much of a reduction that looks to be and I guess on top of what looks to be a $100 million push-out in the spending related to the wafer upgrade?", "Wolfgang Nickl", "Yes, I think again in the 775 to 800 million units, you will have 100 million included for the 6 to 8-inch wafer conversion and for the upgrade of our Singapore facility to optimize the output there. If you would roughly take this over a Street consensus revenue, excluding the onetime wafer, we're probably more towards the 7%, which is a function of the lower volume output and our just-in-time investments there. And then part of the 6-to 8-inch investments are moving into next year and it could be up to 100 million there.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And final question from me. I know we talked a little bit about where you though OEM levels where for inventory. Can you talk about the pull from a distribution perspective for the final few weeks of March? And compare that relative to what a historical trend has been, and where we've exited the March quarter as far as channel inventory levels?", "Timothy Leyden", "General industry levels are below the 4- to 6-week target -- are bends that we normally talk about. And actually within that, both of the individual components of that, which is the distribution and the retail are well below their individual metrics. So in very good shape.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And can you talk about demand pull at the final couple of weeks for the quarter relative to what normally the demand looks like?", "Timothy Leyden", "They were very strong. I mean, and there were two things that drove that from an OEM viewpoint, there was when you looked at the information out of Taiwan for the ODMs they indicated that they had very strong March because the fact that the CPU, the lateness of the CPU delivery, enabled them or it required them to be able to catch up. And then we had the concern about the Japanese earthquake which drove very strong pulls from all channels in the last several weeks of the quarter.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Again not to push you, but I mean were we 20% higher than we typically are, 30% higher? I'm trying to just understand what \"really strong\" means.", "John Coyne", "Well, I think if you look at it, we believe that while February -- January tracked to the 155 guidance we gave in the last call for TAM. January tracked, February was weak. And we believe March, CPU delivery-driven demand would've delivered the quarter on track at 155. And we believe the incremental 5 million is response to the earthquake.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays.", "Eric Sterling", "Hey, good afternoon. This is actually Eric Sterling for Ben Reitzes. I just had a quick question on your pricing expectations, for the remainder of the year.", "Wolfgang Nickl", "Again like we said, we're just providing color on the quarter that we've just started. We believe it is the price declines quarter-over-quarter are slightly below the historical norm. There are price declines because we had some pre-committed pricing in pre-3 '11 events and the swap markets have firmed up a bit as a function of supply demand, but it's way too early to tell what the pricing outlook would be for the remainder of the quarter. Our focus is on reducing our cost so that we continue to provide value to the marketplace.", "Eric Sterling", "Right. And just in terms of the pending acquisition, are the long-term gross margin targets I believe they were 19% to 24% are those still intact?", "John Coyne", "Yes.", "Eric Sterling", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG", "Thank you. You mentioned on the call that you think you'll be able to meet your commitments to the OEMs this quarter and now you're working on upside. So I'm curious, with other suppliers potentially having supply constraints this quarter, do you think you'll be able to gain share in the quarter? What is your expectation?", "John Coyne", "We'll see when the quarter is done. Our focus is on ensuring that we give the best support we possibly can to our customer needs.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. And then for the second half of the calendar year, do you plan to add capacity to support additional volumes in the second half?", "John Coyne", "As Wolfgang indicated, in response to a CapEx question, typically, we track the market very closely and we do just-in-time investment into capacity. And to Tim's point, we think there's going to be a component supply constraint throughout the industry through the September quarter. We then see an uptick in December from a demand perspective. We will plan to support that, but not over support it.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay, so based on -- I know you guys have a history of bringing on capacity just-in-time. Should I assume that you're not currently adding any capacity right now?", "John Coyne", "I think that's encompassed by the capital guidance we've given for the full year.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Joe Yoo with Citi Investment Research.", "Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc", "Thank you. My first question is on the Samsung, Seagate deal. Obviously it's looked upon as being positive for the over-all industry, from a pricing perspective, but one of the concerns coming out of this is that TDK's incentive to be in the drive business could wane over time if Toshiba does not execute. How big of a concern is this to your company given that they are a critical component supplier?", "John Coyne", "We think that the -- our primary focus of course is on our acquisition of HGST, which we believe provides value to our customers and shareholders through our ability to enhance our technology, product portfolio and scale. We did indicate in our go forward strategy that our external, critical technology suppliers would continue to be a substantial and very important part of our go forward strategy. We've not worked our way through all of the implications of the Seagate, Samsung deal as it may relate to Seagate's choices post-combination as to their external sourcing strategy. And if that were to change substantially what that impact might be on TDK. But our focus is on working with our critical technology suppliers to ensure that they have viable, underpinned, go forward strategies for technology, quality and availability and competitiveness. And we're certainly very focused on working with those suppliers to ensure that, that continues.", "Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc", "Thank you. The second question is on the gross margins towards the back half of this year. It doesn't seem like the new products will have a meaningful impact to margins in 2012. And obviously it seems to be that you'll have some supply issues as well. Based on these challenges, is it unreasonable to expect gross margins to get back to at least the midpoint of your normal target range?", "Wolfgang Nickl", "Too early to tell. The model is 18% to 23% and typically in the latter half of the year you're in the upper end of this but it's really too early to tell.", "Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc", "And then my last question is on the PC food chain overall. You've put out there concerns about certain components for PCs potentially being a bottleneck. I mean how big of a concern is that relative to the ability of HDD suppliers to provide the drives in the second half?", "John Coyne", "Well, I think there's still some discovery in that area. I mean, it's a relatively multi-tiered supply chain with not only the components we normally think about like finished semiconductors, but all of the subcomponents and materials that go into that. We do know that there are some concerns in the semiconductor world about silicon wafers, about semiconductor packaging materials in the printed circuit board world about some of the chemicals and metals that go into making circuit boards. So there's -- then there's an issue of the continuing rolling blackouts in Japan, I mean there are a whole series of uncertainties. We're not fully convinced that they're fully understood yet. And you just need one thing that cannot be sourced that is essential to system build to alter the landscape. So I think there's going to be some uncertainty throughout the balance of this quarter because remember, most people are currently operating on parts in pipeline that were already in place prior to the earthquake. And so, the real true impact, I think, will begin to be much better framed as we get towards the end of May.", "Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Kaushik Roy with Wedbush.", "Kaushik Roy - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "Did you notice that distributers and OEMs started allocating more to your competitors specifically Seagate after the HGST announcement?", "John Coyne", "You were very faint, but I think the question is had we noticed any reallocation of business away from WD and the post acquisition announcement phase?", "Kaushik Roy - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "Correct.", "John Coyne", "We have not. It's hard to tell whether that's driven by availability or whether we're continuing to do as good a job for customers as we've been doing up until now. That's certainly our objective. ", "So I think that's all the questions we've time for. Operator, I'd just like, in closing, to thank all of you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in the company and in the industry. And we look forward to seeing you again in another quarter. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. This does conclude the conference. You may disconnect at this time.

As a reminder, today's presentation is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jay Iyer. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Doris, and good afternoon. Joining us on the call today are Sanjay Mehrotra, President and CEO of SanDisk; and Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President of Administration and CFO.", "Before we begin, please note that any non-GAAP financial measures discussed during this call, as defined by the SEC in Regulation G, will be reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. That reconciliation is now available along with supplemental schedules on our website at sandisk.com/ir. In addition, during our call today, we will make forward-looking statements.

", "With that, I will turn the call over to Sanjay.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I provide a review of business results and activities, I would like to spend a few minutes on the recent events in Japan, as I know the topic is of key interest to you. ", "On March 11, Japan suffered a major earthquake and a series of significant follow-on events. Our prayers go to those impacted by these events. Fortunately for SanDisk, our employees and their families in Japan were unharmed. In addition, our joint venture wafer fabs in Yokkaichi were relatively unaffected, as they were approximately 500 miles from the quake's epicenter. The earthquake halted normal fab operations for less than a day. The fabs have not been subject to rolling power outages or blackouts. We have been working closely with Toshiba as well as other business partners in Japan to minimize the impact to our NAND flash wafer production. ", "Based on our current assessment of the entire wafer fab-related supply chain, there are no immediate constraints of key materials, chemicals, gases or other consumables. Where we have identified potential future shortages, we have been actively working to find, qualify and implement effective solutions, including alternative sources. Judy will provide an estimate for the total costs we incurred in the first quarter from the earthquake, as well as from an unrelated power outage that occurred in March due to a maintenance issue in Fab 4. ", "We did suffer a modest loss of supply due to the downtime from the power outage and earthquake. In addition, we expect some earthquake-related delays in tool deliveries from certain suppliers in Japan that will affect our expected 2011 captive supply growth. Overall, we project a slight reduction in plant captive supply growth from the mid-80% range we estimated previously for 2011. We continue our efforts to maximize captive output and evaluate prudent use of non-captive supply.", "Aside from our captive flash memory vehicle production in Japan, the rest of the supply chain related to the products we sell is operated out of Taiwan and China through our vehicle foundry suppliers for memory controllers, our own assembly and test factory in Shanghai as well as our subcontractor partners outside of Japan. We acted quickly to identify potential shortages and secure and qualify replacement materials. ", "Through collaborations with partners in the supply chain, we currently have no concerns for meeting our future back-end production requirements. I'm proud of our entire manufacturing operations team, particularly SanDisk employees at the wafer fabs in Yokkaichi, Japan, as well as our partner, Toshiba, for promptly assessing and addressing earthquake-related production issues. I'm thankful for their dedication, around-the-clock hard work and excellent team spirit to minimize any impacts to our business in this difficult period for Japan.", "From a captive capacity perspective, we completed the expansion of Fab 4 in the first quarter, and that facility is now operating at its full capacity. We expect minimal delay in the timing of the ramp of Fab 5. And the new facility should begin augmenting our overall captive supply in the second half of this year. From a demand standpoint, we have not seen any customer pullbacks in the near term, and we are monitoring order trends very carefully. We have been in close contact with our customers to keep them abreast of earthquake-related supply issues, and we appreciate their collaboration and support during this period in helping us qualify replacement materials so that we can fulfill their demand. Based on the strong demand trends that we see in our markets and combined with our supply expectations, we expect to be somewhat supply constrained for the remainder of the year.", "Turning to the first quarter, we delivered strong results through solid planning and execution. OEM demand grew sequentially and the retail channel exhibited normal seasonality. Total unit sales of our products grew a very strong 11% sequentially, reflecting a robust market environment, as well as successful execution of our diversified product and channel strategy. Our OEM business continued to be propelled by the mobile end markets and the products that drove the unit growth for iNAND, other embedded solutions and removable microSD cards. ", "Total unit sales of mobile products grew nearly 40% on a year-over-year basis. The smartphone market remains as vibrant as ever, with more than 250 new models expected to launch in 2011 alone, according to industry analysts. And this bodes well for our mobile product lineup. Tablet customer activity remains strong for us, and we are seeing requests for 16 gigabyte and higher capacities of our embedded solutions for this market. We continue to make good progress on our modular SSDs, the unit shipments increasing nicely, driven by the growing ultra-thin portable computer market. ", "Our retail business posted good revenue growth on a year-over-year basis, driven by demand from all key regions except Europe, which continues to be impacted by macroeconomic factors. In the BRIC countries, our unit sales have grown approximately 75% on a year-over-year basis. This reflects both our market share gains and rapid growth in demand for our products. ", "On the product front, we began shipments of the SanDisk Extreme Pro SDHC cards that are based on the new SD 3.0 UHS specification. These high-performance cards are geared to support the increasing adoption of the 1080p full HD resolution video in both cameras and digital camcorders. ", "We see the full HD video recording feature increasingly moving not only to more attractively priced digital SLR but point-and-shoot cameras as well, and that should drive a greater demand for high-performance and higher-capacity cards. We also started shipping USB flash drive products with the SanDisk SecureAccess software, which protects files against unauthorized access by creating an encrypted password-protected folder or vault on the USB flash drive.", "Switching gears to manufacturing. The 24-nanometer technology, utilizing both 2-bits-per-cell and 3-bits-per-cell architectures, continues to ramp well, and we expect it will account for the majority of our captive output in the second half of this year. We don't anticipate the recent events in Japan to cause any meaningful changes to the schedule of the ramp of 24-nanometer or 19-nanometer technology, which we announced yesterday.", "At our Analyst Day in February, we presented our floating gate NAND roadmap extending to 1x, which is now 19-nanometer, and then to 1y nodes. We are also simultaneously exploring further scaling approaches for NAND beyond the 1y node and other possible future technologies. In the first quarter, we made an incremental strategic technology investment with Toshiba that covers a variety of technologies, including a 3-dimensional NAND architecture known as bit cost scalable, or BiCS, which Toshiba had been developing independently. We believe that SanDisk and Toshiba joining forces to codevelop BiCS will allow us to further build on our fast decade of successful development of multiple generations of NAND flash technologies. ", "BiCS, if successfully developed and commercialized, can leverage the storage NAND tool sets in the wafer fabs very well, thereby extending the useful life of fab equipment. We expect BiCS to enable further memory cost reductions beyond the future 1y or subsequent-schemed NAND until 3D Read/Write memory, which remains our ultimate goal, is fully ramped into high-volume production. ", "Speaking of 3D Read/Write, joint development work with Toshiba is progressing well and as also mentioned at the Analyst Day, we believe it will require extreme ultraviolet, EUV, lithography for future volume production. The extreme ultraviolet lithography equipment and technology are in early stages of development and the timeframe for commercial deployment is yet to be determined. Our 3-pronged approach to R&D collaborations with Toshiba in the areas of NAND scaling, BiCS and 3D Read/Write should position us well for continued technology and cost leadership in the coming decades. ", "In closing, we are pleased with the strong start for the year. We continue to manage the impact of recent events in Japan, and on taking advantage of secular growth markets for NAND flash. Overall, we continue to experience a healthy environment for our business, and we are driving hard and executing well on all fronts. ", "With that, I will turn the call to Judy.", "Judy Bruner", "Thank you, Sanjay. We are pleased to report a strong first quarter, with revenue up 19% year-over-year, non-GAAP operating margin at a robust 28.5% and non-GAAP EPS of 8% year-over-year. Our gigabytes sold grew 7% sequentially, while ASP per gigabyte declined 8%. And on a year-over-year basis, gigabytes sold increased 78% and ASP per gigabyte declined 32%.", "Our sequential price decline of 8% was modest for a first quarter and was influenced by mix, with OEM growing to 66% of sales from 59% in Q4 and USB mix increasing seasonality within retail. And both of these mix shifts lead to a somewhat lower ASP per gigabyte. As Sanjay mentioned, our retail business exhibited normal seasonality, down 19% sequentially, and we were pleased with the year-over-year growth in retail revenue of 10%. ", "Year-over-year retail sales growth was good in both the Americas and APAC, with particularly strong growth in the fast-growing regions of China, India and Latin America, where we also believe we are gaining share. Our EMEA retail sales were down slightly year-over-year, with economic weakness in Europe, partially offset by solid growth in the Middle East and Africa. Our OEM sales grew 9% sequentially and 29% year-over-year, with the clear driver of growth being our embedded products. We were also pleased with the sequential growth and sales of our modular SSDs and our gaming products. ", "Our non-GAAP product gross margin for the first quarter was 39%, inclusive of a $25 million charge for the combination of a power outage in Fab 4 and the Japan earthquake. A maintenance issue occurred in Fab 4 on March 8 which resulted in a power outage that brought equipment to a stop. Fab 4 was in the process of returning to normal output when the March 11 earthquake occurred, which of course impacted both fabs. And both fabs recovered fully by March 13. ", "The $25 million charge, or 2 points of product gross margin, includes the cost of scrapped wafers, fixed costs associated with lost wafer output and costs to bring the fabs back online. Q1 product gross margin was also negatively impacted by the yen-to-dollar exchange rate, with the sequential impact being about 1.7 percentage points. However, unlike the power outage and earthquake, the yen impact was anticipated in our forecast as the rates experienced in our cost of sales are largely determined by purchases in the previous quarter.", "Our non-captive memory usage was approximately 5%, similar to the fourth quarter. Our first quarter cost per gigabyte improved sequentially by 8%, inclusive of the $25 million charge, the unfavorable yen movement and our non-captive usage. ", "First quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $189 million, less than we had expected, primarily because of the timing of certain Fab 5 R&D start-up costs, which we now expect to incur in Q2 instead of Q1. Other income and expense was income of $5 million, lower than Q4 by approximately $8 million, primarily because Q4 benefited from approximately $5 million in gains on the sale of investments and because of foreign exchange fluctuations. Our non-GAAP tax rate for Q1 was 33% as expected, and our GAAP tax rate was 32.3%.", "On the balance sheet, cash and short- and long-term marketable securities increased sequentially by $164 million, bringing gross cash to $5.5 billion and net cash to over $3.3 billion. Our Q1 cash flow from operations was $399 million, reflecting strong profitability and positive contribution from both receivables and inventory. Our accounts receivable collections were excellent and our inventory reflects 6 turns measured in dollars and more than 7 turns measured in petabytes.", "Cash used for CapEx-related investing included a loan of $214 million to the Fab 4 Flash Alliance venture, a return of capital of $85 million from the Fab 3 Flash Partners venture and non-fab capital investments of $34 million, all adding to a total net capital cash investment of $163 million. ", "Our total capital investments during Q1 were approximately $200 million, with the difference between this and the $163 million cash outlay funded by joint venture working capital. We also invested $115 million in technology and other assets, including the investment in technologies that Sanjay described. Our off-balance sheet lease guarantees for fab equipment stood at $739 million at the end of Q1.", "I'll now turn to forward-looking commentary. Please note that non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation tables for all applicable guidance are posted on our website. For the second quarter, our captive memory supply has been reduced by the fab downtime in Q1, and we do not believe we can fully make up the shortfall of non-captive supply due to lead-time constraints and mix considerations. Our assessment of demand is that it continues to be strong, and we believe we will be somewhat supply-constrained for the second quarter. ", "Our estimate of the industry-pricing environment for Q2 is stronger than in our original forecast for the year, and this partially offsets the impact of a supply constraint. We forecast Q2 total revenue to be between $1.3 billion and $1.35 billion. The Q1 fab events also lower our full year estimates of captive supply. However, we expect industry price decline for the year to be more moderate than we had originally estimated, and we remain comfortable with the revenue estimate that I provided at our February Analyst Day, at which time I indicated increased confidence in the upper half of the $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion range provided in January.", "We forecast Q2 gross margin percentage to be similar to the first quarter, which is better than our original estimates due to the pricing environment. Compared to Q1, our second quarter gross margin forecast is positively impacted by the expectation that there will be no fab downtime charges and negatively impacted by our plan to use a higher proportion of non-captive memory in Q2 than in Q1.", "For the full year, we are raising our non-GAAP product gross margin range to 37% to 40%, compared to the previous range of 35% to 38%, and raising the total non-GAAP gross margin range to 41% to 44% compared to the previous range of 39% to 42%.  ", "Our non-GAAP operating expense forecast for the second quarter is $215 million to $225 million, with the most significant increases in R&D, largely driven by the impact of Fab 5 start-up costs and the new technology investments we began in Q1. Other income for Q2 is expected to be similar to Q1, and our non-GAAP tax rate forecast remains at 33%.", "We remain on track for a 2011 capital investment in fab and non-fab equipment between $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion. The estimated cash requirement for these investments remains at $800 million to $900 million, of which we utilized $163 million in the first quarter.", "In summary, we produced strong results in the first quarter, and our outlook for the year is intact or better. We will now open the call for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Daniel Amir with Lazard Capital Markets.", "Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks a lot. Thank you for taking my call. A couple of questions here. First of all, on the captive versus non-captive, can you give us any sort of visibility? How should we look at the non-captive here going forward? It was 5% in Q1, it's increasing as the year progresses. And what type of visibility could you see of maybe meeting the demand in the market by going to non-captive sources? And then I have 1 follow-up.", "Judy Bruner", "Daniel, I'll take that. At our Analyst Day, I had indicated that we expect to use up to 10% non-captive supply in our mix for 2011. And our estimates for this year remain in that range. We do expect that we will utilize a higher mix of non-captive in the second quarter than in the first quarter where it was 5%, but we remain in the 10% or less range for the full year. And we really make these decisions on non-captive usage on a month-by-month basis as we go and as the year progresses.", "Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. My follow-up question is on bigger picture on kind of the industry. I mean, there's capacity coming onboard in the second half of the year by some of your competitors. I mean, how do you view kind of the rest of the year in terms of the industry side? It seems like SanDisk might be capacity-constrained, but in terms of the industry, what's the view on kind of the next 6 to 9 months in terms of the industry capacity? Thanks.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We feel that the environment for demand is strong in 2011 and beyond. And particularly, when you look at the secular demand trends, the markets for our products in the mobile phone, the tablets and SSD opportunities continuing to emerge as well. So when you look at third-party industry studies, they show that this growth, even with new capacity coming on from our various suppliers, including ourselves, is in the range of high-70s to high-80s. And in our case, we had indicated that our total supply for the year is somewhat impacted. So all in all, I think we continue to see healthy demand and supply environment in our industry, including in the second half. And really, this is particularly because the demand trends continue to be strong.", "Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Atif Malik with Morgan Stanley.", "Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks for taking my question. And a good job on the quarter and the guidance, given the limitations that the company was facing with the Japan earthquake. Question on the cost reduction. Judy, at your analyst event, you said cost reduction of 30% for the year, that includes 7 to 9 percentage points of then kind of onetime charges, including the yen. Can you talk about the loading of this cost reduction, 8% cost reduction in 1Q? Should we model it linearly through the year? Or can you just talk about the trajectory of the cost reduction?", "Judy Bruner", "I would tell you that our 24-nanometer transition, which is the key driver of cost reduction during 2011, is progressing across the year. I can't give you real specific projections on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but that transition started in the fourth quarter of 2010 and is progressing across 2011. So we should see cost reduction across the year.", "Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley", "And the 19-nanometer announcement was baked into that 30% cost reduction that you gave at the analyst event.", "Judy Bruner", "The 19-nanometer is really starting later in the year and is really more a cost-reduction driver for 2012.", "Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley", "Got it. And second thing, inventory. Can you talk about the inventory at your OEMs? Obviously, there's a concern that non-Apple tablets might not sell well. I mean, if you can talk about the inventory at OEMs for NAND.", "Judy Bruner", "We believe that the inventory levels in the channel and held by our customers are fairly normal. We're not aware of any real issues in terms of inventory out there.", "Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks.", "Operator", "We'll go next Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thank you for taking my question. As you're looking out along those lines with the inventory being fairly normal, is there any change in the, I guess, the demand from different sectors? Are you seeing any change from tablets to SSD or more in the -- you mentioned the higher-performance flash.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "In terms of demand, let me just address it between retail and OEM. As you mentioned, on the retail side, we see significant increases in our demand in the emerging markets area, particularly the APAC area. And that's really due to the growing demand in that region, as well as our market share gains in the region. And Europe, and particularly certain pockets of Europe, do continue to be somewhat weak as we indicated in the prepared remarks. And on the OEM side, the demand driver really is very much from the smartphone market as well as other mobile phones. And the tablet market is certainly picking up nicely. And we are engaged with all the leading players in the smartphone as well as in the tablet market. And that positions us well to ride the opportunity going forward. And of course, the SSD market, there for us, at this point, it's more in the thin form factor devices, the ultra-thin notebooks. Our very low-profile packages such as our pSSD are doing well in that marketplace. So SSD is certainly still in very early stages, but building up as a nice opportunity for the future.", "Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. How about any change in the demand for 1-bit-per-cell or 2-bit versus 3-bit?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So all of our production, as you know, is really pretty much between 2-bit-per-cell and 3-bit-per-cell memory, and our mix of memory in Q1 was approximately 50% for X3. And this is because the embedded part of the business on the OEM side is growing rapidly. And that part of the business as we had indicated at the Analyst Day, is still X2-based, although we are making nice progress in continuing to increase quarter-over-quarter in terms of utilizing more X3 bits in that part of the business as well. For the full year, we expect our X3 bits to be more than 50%.", "Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We'll go to Daniel Berenbaum with Auriga USA.", "Ada Menaker - Auriga USA LLC", "This is Ada Menaker for Dan Berenbaum. Could you provide some additional granularity on SSDs? Are you seeing any, from your customers, any request for 2-bit-per-cell on enterprise SSDs? Or are those also 3-bit-per-cell?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "With respect to our SSD products today, they are really all 2-bit-based products. We certainly look at 3-bit-based products as an opportunity for us in the future timeframe. Not for 2011, but maybe sometime beyond that. Regarding the enterprise space, there is some SLC utilization in enterprise. But SanDisk is really not a player in the SLC market. But even the enterprises space is converting to 2-bit-per-cell memory technology.", "Ada Menaker - Auriga USA LLC", "Thank you. And for my other question, could you maybe provide some detail on your royalty revenue?", "Judy Bruner", "The license and royalty revenue is down very slightly sequentially from Q4 to Q1, and that's really a factor of the licensable revenue of our license fees during their fourth quarter, which is translated into our first quarter.", "Ada Menaker - Auriga USA LLC", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go to Hendi Susanto with Gabelli & Company.", "Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Thank you for taking my call. Great results. My first question is how much cost advantage does the new 19-nanometer process technology offer? And can you refresh our memory also on the cost advantage of 24-nanometer versus 32-nanometer?", "Judy Bruner", "So let me just repeat, Hendi, because you cut out a bit. Are you asking for the cost advantage of 19-nanometer versus 24-nanometer?", "Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Yes. And then 24-nanometer versus 32-nanometer?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So regarding the 19-nanometer, as Judy indicated and we have indicated in our prepared remarks as well as the press release, that will go into production in the second half of the year. So we will really provide more detail regarding the cost benefits of 19-nanometer at that time. With respect to 24-nanometer, basically, of course, the cost reduction, purely on wafer level between the 24-nanometer and 32-nanometer. Just doing simply apples-to-apples comparison without taking into consideration any exchange rate effects or any yield affects and assuming mature yields, the benefit there is in the range of 30% to 40%. But that's just at the memory level. Keep in mind that our ultimate cost reduction has multiple factors in it. Our ultimate cost reduction that we discussed on a year-over-year basis has multiple factors. Those being the ramp-up of 24-nanometer, the exchange rate, the fab-related, Fab 5-related start-up costs, as well as non-captive usage. So I just don't want you to mix the 2 numbers. The technology benefit or in terms of cost versus our overall cost reduction year-over-year.", "Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "And what is the split between spot price and contract price in your OEM retail and overall?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "I can't -- we really do not supply, not at least directly to the spot market. And the split between spot market prices and contract prices, I mean, to the extent that it is out in the public, you can look at it, it's quoted on the DRAMeXchange. But that's really for the industry.", "Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Uche Orji with UBS.", "Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank", "Thank you very much. So Judy, let me start by asking since you provided us an update on revenues and margins for the full year, how should we be thinking about costs for the full year? Is it still roughly $850 million?", "Judy Bruner", "Expenses?", "Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank", "Expenses, yes.", "Judy Bruner", "Right. At this point, we believe that the full-year estimate of $850 million for OpEx is still our best estimate.", "Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay, great. Let me ask you a different question. Sanjay, on the power outages, this is the second quarter in a row where we've had a power outage, 1 in December and 1 even before the earthquake. What are you doing to make sure that this doesn't constantly reoccur? I mean, among all the major fab operators, this seems to be more reoccurring with you than others. Secondly, in terms of how we should think about the impact, thanks, Judy, for giving us the cost impact, but when something like this happens, what should go through our minds in terms of what is affected within the factory network within the process, just so that we can calibrate it quickly enough without having to wait until the end of the quarter to be told by Judy?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Okay. So with respect to the power outage in the fab, in the Q4 timeframe of last year as well as Q1 of this year, let me elaborate on that. First of all, the power outage that occurred in Q4 was really an occurrence on the infrastructure, the power infrastructure in the area. Basically, a glitch in power supply in the area generated at the power supply company. And that glitch actually was of a very short duration, slightly above 100 milliseconds, and that impacted some of our equipment in Fab 3, and actually Fab 4 at that time, survived that okay. And Fab 4 is newer construction, and we have actually upgraded some of our equipment with the power structure in the fabs to improve that in that area. So the Q4 power glitch was created by -- I mean, the Q4 power outage was created by a glitch on the power company side. In terms of the Q1 glitch, this really occurred only in Fab 4, and this occurred due to an operator error. And basically we have taken actions, corrective actions in terms of process control. So really 2 very different reasons. The Q4 reason, not in our control, even though we have improved the fab tolerance to any power glitch in the future. And Q1 reason, human operator error, and we have taken corrective actions in terms of training, et cetera, with the fabs. And let me actually correct myself, the Q4 glitch occurred in both the fabs, Fab 3 as well as Fab 4, and the Q1 glitch, the Q1 power outage was impacted by human error in Fab 4 only.", "Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay, great. Let me just ask you 1 last question, please. In the embedded business, you seem to be making some significant progress there. Can you talk about what you see as a potential opportunity for the iNAND and the modular SSD businesses this year? And at least for this year, where are you in terms of monetizing these 200 design wins you had last year? Who is shipping and how much more upside should we expect potentially, even if we didn't have supply constraints? Just for us to gauge how much is coming from that. And also, what kind of margin should we anticipate going forward with the OEM business? It seems to have been dilutive to gross margins overall. Are we at a point where that should stabilize at least?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So with respect to the OEM business and iNAND design wins, the ones we had talked about at the Analyst Day, actually many of those design wins are already getting into production and that's what is really resulting in strong growth of our OEM business as well as the embedded business in particular. So the embedded business total overall in Q1 was over 40% of the total OEM business. And keep in mind that many of these design wins that we had discussed are also multi-year opportunities for us. So we are really doing well with our iNAND design wins. And you asked about pSSD. We are doing well there as well. It's a small part of our revenue in Q1, but we expect it to be growing nicely in the quarters ahead. And I think Judy can comment on the OEM margin question.", "Judy Bruner", "Right. I mean, keep in mind, as Sanjay just said, that the embedded business was more than 40% of our OEM business in the first quarter and we had strong gross margins in the first quarter. Of course, the iNAND business today is more X2 than it is X3, and we want to continue to improve that X3 mix, and we're making progress on that. And so that will be positive for margins as we continue to expand the X3 mix within the iNAND business.", "Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the private investor, Arthur Bechhofer [ph].", "Unknown Speaker", "Thank you for taking my question. I'm looking at the amount of cash that you have and in relationship to the total shareholder equity, and the relationship looks very, very high. Could you explain just a little bit more, give us a little bit better idea of why the cash is so high?", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. Keep in mind that our cash on a net basis, net of the maturity value of our convertible debt instruments, is between $3.3 billion and $3.4 billion. And as you know, we're a very capital-intensive business. And in fact we have a major fab, Fab 5, that is going to be ramping over the next several years and will require capital investment. So we are comfortable with the amount of cash that we are holding relative to the capital investment that we need to make and ensuring that we continue to have a very strong and a very flexible balance sheet, including flexibility for other investments that we may choose to make over time.", "Unknown Speaker", "Do you see any possibility of a dividend in the near future?", "Judy Bruner", "I would say not in the near future. We've never paid a dividend. I don't anticipate that, given the capital investment we have in front of us over the next several years.", "Unknown Speaker", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go to Greg (sic) [Craig] Ellis with Caris & Company.", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "Thanks for taking the question. Nice job in that tough environment, guys. Judy, you mentioned that the company's outlook for pricing had changed and become more favorable. Can you give a little bit more context in terms of when you all felt comfortable starting to take a different view of the market's pricing? And can you quantify specifically how much the view has changed?", "Judy Bruner", "Well, we saw a fairly favorable pricing environment across Q1 and into Q2 so far. So I can't pinpoint an exact time when our view changed, but we have become more comfortable that the pricing, the price decline for the year will be more moderate than we had originally anticipated in our estimates. The expectation for price decline for the year is still a bit higher than our estimate of cost decline because our product gross margin guidance of 37% to 40% is still a bit lower than the product gross margin last year. But we've not quantified the specific pricing estimates or the specific cost reduction estimates. And keep in mind that in that cost reduction, we still have the impact of the 3 factors that I spoke about at length at our Analyst Day, namely the yen exchange rate and Fab 5 start-up costs, as well as the non-captive mix.", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "As well as now the power outage issue in the first quarter, right?", "Judy Bruner", "Clearly, yes. And that puts, of course, some pressure on the cost reduction for the full year.", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "Okay. And then just a clarification, you mentioned that there was fab start-up expenses in the quarter, but it sounds like not as much as expected. Can you quantify what the impact was to 1Q and what you're expecting for Q2?", "Judy Bruner", "I'm not going to give a specific breakdown by quarter. But the Fab 5 start-up costs that we've incurred so far have been predominantly in R&D. And my estimate of the total R&D Fab 5 start-up costs for the year is still about $50 million in R&D and about $75 million in cost of sales. And that $50 million in R&D is anticipated in Q1 through Q3, with the heaviest period in the second quarter.", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "Okay, very good. And then lastly, Sanjay, I'm wondering if you can just talk a little bit about the product side of the business from a mix standpoint. This is the first time in a couple of quarters, at least, that I remember the company really talking about SSD. So when do you think the SSD business can become a material percentage of revenue percentage?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "I think, again, in the small form factor SSDs, such as pSSD, the business is continuing to grow, although for this year it will remain small. We expect this to become a bigger part of our business next year and going forward, beyond that. Regarding the high-performance SSDs, we plan to have products in the second half of the year. And I would expect there to start becoming a growing opportunity for us next year onward as well. So overall, for 2011, SSD will remain a small revenue contributor, relatively small revenue contributor for us, but it becomes a larger opportunity for us from 2012 onwards.", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "Good luck. Thanks.", "Operator", "We'll go to Bob Gujavarty with Deutsche Bank.", "Bobby Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank AG", "Thanks. I was curious in this kind of constrained environment, are you in a position to kind of optimize your product mix in terms of just perhaps shifting more Extreme cards at the expense of your blue label cards, those kind of things? Or is that further potential upside in terms of mix and margins?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So in this kind of constrained environment, we definitely do manage the mix of our products. And if we take into consideration various factors, such as short-term revenue and profit opportunity, as well as longer-term strategic customers, strategic consideration for our customers as well. But absolutely, I mean, we do have opportunities to mix our products to drive optimally our business forward.", "Bobby Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank AG", "Great. And just a follow-up, I don't know if you can speak about Toshiba to this extent. But my understanding is Toshiba is a conglomerate and they do have a nuclear power division. Have you noticed any distraction at Toshiba in their NAND operations relative to some of their other exposure and their other businesses?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Not really. As I said in my prepared remarks, we really are very thankful to Toshiba and certainly, to our people in Yokkaichi as well. I mean, our NAND operations, both in terms of R&D and manufacturing, are really driving full speed ahead.", "Bobby Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank AG", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.", "Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Thank you for taking my question. On the 19-nanometer announcement, and congratulations for the execution on that, I think you said previously you'd start to ramp 1x at the end of this year. In your press release, you said second half of this year. And so it seems like the ramp may have gotten pulled forward by a few months. I'm just wondering, do you expect a larger mix of 1x this year versus what you showed at your Analyst Day?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "No, we don't expect larger mix. It will be relatively small. Part of our production output this year. 1x is in qualification stages and development stages, and we plan to begin production in the second half.", "Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. And then on the product side, again at your Analyst Day, the team spent quite a bit of time discussing the opportunities in the enterprise markets. It's a potentially big opportunity for SanDisk. Wondering when are we going to see the team bring specific products targeting enterprise applications to the markets. Any inputs here would be greatly appreciated.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "As we said at the Analyst Day, we really do consider enterprise as a growing and exciting opportunity for the business, for the NAND industry. We are evaluating our participation in that marketplace. There are a couple of different ways to participate in it. 1 is definitely sell our high-quality flash components for enterprise SSD storage, and of course, other way is to partner and have product offerings in the SSD space as well. So we are currently assessing our options here. It's an important area for us for the future.", "Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. And just 1 last question, Sanjay. I know you talked a little bit about managing the materials and chemicals and the disruptions there. But can you specifically address the 12-inch starting wafer -- 12-inch wafer supply and your ability to procure those wafers as you look out to the remainder of the year, given some of the disruptions by some of your suppliers?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So regarding the 12-inch wafers for Yokkaichi production, our supply needs are addressed for the next few months through our own inventory, as well as our supply mix from various suppliers of 12-inch wafers to the fabs. We actually have multiple suppliers of 12-inch wafers on the fabs, and as is well known, a certain supplier was in the impacted area. But our teams moved very quickly to secure supply from other suppliers as well. So between our inventory and between somewhat of a shift in mix of the wafers from different suppliers, our needs are met for the next few months. And beyond that, we think we will be fine because these suppliers are expected to come up going forward as well.", "Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. Thank you very much, Sanjay.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And Mr. Iyer, there are no further questions at this time, sir.

", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Sanjay.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to report record revenue in Q2, representing 17% year-over-year growth. This revenue achievement reflects the continued progress in our channel and plus our diversification strategy and brand leadership. ", "Our joint venture fabs in Japan operating at high-efficiency levels, coupled with the benefits of the 24-nanometer transition enabled excellent cost reductions, which drove our strong second quarter profitability. The mobile market, which accounted for 57% of our business, grew 40% year-over-year, primarily due to a fix forward increase in iNAND revenue. Design paradigm for iNAND is excellent, and we believe it now the captures a large majority of the high-capacity, embedded designs in a wide variety of mobile devices. ", "We broadened the iNAND portfolio with the launch of the high-performance iNAND Extreme. Together with the iNAND, iNAND Ultra and other embedded solutions of our embedded product portfolio is now well segmented to address the needs of all mobile and consumer electronics market from feature phones to high-end tablets, and from e-book readers to connected television, set-top boxes and Blu-ray players.", "INAND products utilize Adaptive Flash Management that increases system responsiveness for faster application loading, web browsing and multitasking. SanDisk works closely with the major mobile OEMs, chipsets and operating system vendors to ensure tight integration between host and storage devices. This engagement is crucial to achieving a more enjoyable user experience, and it is a key reason why we believe iNAND ranks among the leading embedded solutions in the market.", "Our retail revenue grew year-over-year driven by strength in Latin America, Middle East and Asia. We are pleased with the robust growth in sales of our imaging cards, particularly with the mix shift we realized toward Ultra and Extreme products. These high-performance cards have a powerful brand appeal and they work very well with advance features of the latest digital camera models, and additionally, they command a pricing premium in the market. We also saw a year-over-year revenue growth from USB drives. Looking forward to the second half of the year, our retail teams are busy preparing for the upcoming back-to-school and holiday seasons, and we believe we are well-positioned in our key accounts.", "On May 25, we announced the completion of our acquisition of Pliant Technology, a leader in enterprise-class SLC and MLC solid state drives. Pliant has now become SanDisk's Enterprise Storage Solutions business, and we welcome the Pliant team to the SanDisk family. The integration of the 2 businesses is progressing well. Our Serial Attached SCSI or SAS, protocol-based SSDs using both SLC and MLC NAND flash have gained very good traction with enterprise customers.

The new drives position us as an industry leader in performance predictability and reliability in enterprise-grade SSD. I'm proud to point out that the new SAS drives have been qualified and integrated, and each piece qualified storage drive offerings and volume shipments have already begun.", "According to industry analysts, SAS-based SSDs are estimated to account for the biggest segment of the approximately $4 billion enterprise SSD market in 2014. And our recently acquired capabilities in this space bode well for our future prospects.", "We are also developing our first PCIe protocol-based SSDs, another large SSD market opportunity. And you will hear more from us on this front in the coming months.", "SanDisk's entry into the enterprise business is an exciting new endeavor, and it's why it's the new, high margin growth opportunity for us over the next several years.", "As we focus on executing and advancing our enterprise storage product roadmap in close collaboration with our customers, I'm pleased to note that this business is in the initial stages of what we expect will be a fast revenue ramp.", "In the client SSD segment, our modular solid state drives continue to do very well in our [indiscernible] notebook products and in tablets. Our modular SSD revenue more than tripled on a year-over-year basis. We believe that our 19-Nanometer flash will enable an attractive price point for the consumer, which is for rapid SSD option in high-performance PCs in 2012. SanDisk is well-positioned to benefit from this trend with a broad line up of consumer SSD products and a supply chain that can lead to high volume and flash requirements of this market.", "We are excited about the opportunities that the enterprise and client storage markets provide for our SSD business in the coming years. We believe that leadership in these markets will favor those who provide higher volume, high-quality and low-cost advanced NAND Flash. SanDisk is well-positioned to deliver on all these trends given our NAND Flash cost leadership, leading-edge flash manufacturing capacity, deep system expertise in fundamental IP, all powerful elements that we have built over the last 2 decades.", "Last week, along with our joint venture partner, Toshiba, we opened Fab 5, our third 300-millimeter wafer Fab in Yokkaichi, Japan. Production has begun, and we expect first wafer output from the new Fab in August. As we have said before, we expect Fab 5 to increase our current captive wafer supply by no more than 10% by the end of 2011. We have not made any decisions to expand Fab 5 beyond our current commitments within Phase 1, and future expansion needs will be driven by our assessment of our customers' demand profiles. The opening of Fab 5 is a significant event for us and we expect the facility to provide us with high-quality, cost competitive supply to drive our growth in diversified end markets over the next decade.", "Turning to the industry, we expect the supply and demand environment to be balanced for the second half of the year. For SanDisk specifically, we believe we remain slightly supply-constrained for the third quarter.", "In closing, our first half 2011 performance was strong, and we are pleased to report record Q2 revenue. We continue to solidify our position as a globally recognized franchise in both retail and OEM channels. We broadened our growth prospects with the formation of the Enterprise Storage Solutions business, adding yet another market segment and a new set of customers to our portfolio. The fundamental drivers of our business remain vibrant, and I believe SanDisk is uniquely positioned to address and benefit from the growing need for flash-based storage solutions.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Judy, for her financial review.", "Judy Bruner", "Thank you, Sanjay. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong top and bottom line results, with record revenues of $1.375 billion, up 17% year-over-year, and non-GAAP operating margin of 29%. Our gigabytes sold grew 14% sequentially, while ASP per gigabyte declined a modest 7%. And on a year-over-year basis, gigabytes sold increased 72% and ASP per gigabyte declined 31%.", "The OEM mix of our business grew to 68% of product revenue, up from 66% in the first quarter. Our retail business increased 2% sequentially and 9% year-over-year, with growth coming primarily from emerging markets where our teams have successfully been increasing our market presence and share.", "In terms of end markets, our sequential retail growth was concentrated in the imaging market, and year-over-year retail growth came primarily from the mobile market. Our OEM business increased 8% sequentially and 22% year-over-year, driven by our embedded mobile products for phones and tablets, as well as by solid state drives. Our license and royalty revenue grew sequentially and year-over-year to $93 million.", "Our non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter improved sequentially by 2 percentage points to 41% for our product business and 45% in total. There were 4 key factors that impacted our sequential gross margins, 2 of them negative and 2 of them positive. Gross margins were negatively impacted by Fab 5 startup costs, which moved from R&D to cost of sales in early June, and also by an increase in our non-captive usage. The 2 key factors sequentially improving gross margins were: first, the absence of charges related to the Q1 earthquake and power outage; and second, and even more impactful, our underlying cost reduction exceeding price decline. With all of these factors included, we generated a sequential cost per gigabyte improvement of 10%. On a sequential basis, the Japanese yen rate had a very small impact on our gross margin.", "On a year-over-year basis, our non-GAAP product gross margin declined by 1 point, while the combined negative impact of the yen exchange rate, Fab 5 startup costs and increased non-captive usage was approximately 8 points of margin. The negative impact from these 3 factors highlights how strong our underlying cost reduction has been relative to price reduction over the last year.", "Our non-GAAP operating expenses in Q2 were $220 million, in the range we expected, and up $32 million sequentially. Most of this increase was in R&D, driven by Fab 5 startup costs, investments in BiCS and other technology development projects, and the inclusion of one month of Pliant expenses. The sequential increase in G&A expenses reflected deal costs from the Pliant acquisition and increased spending to scale various G&A functions.", "In summary, our business model remains very strong, with Q2 non-GAAP operating margin increasing to more than 29% of revenue. Our non-GAAP tax rate for Q2 came down to 32.5% from 33% last quarter due to one-time favorable items.", "On the balance sheet, cash and short- and long-term marketable securities decreased by $228 million to $5.28 billion. Our Q2 cash flow from operations was a positive $269 million, and our investments during the quarter included: $153 million in the Fab 4 Flash Alliance venture; $18 million in the Fab 5 Flash Forward venture; $28 million in non-Fab CapEx, and a net $303 million cash outflow for the Pliant acquisition.", "The total cash paid for Pliant, net of the cash they had on hand, was approximately $324 million, including a $15 million loan provided in Q1, which has been reclassified on our year-to-date cash flow statement, and $6 million of payments that were recorded in Q2 operating cash flow.", "For the first half of the year, our Fab and non-Fab CapEx investments totaled approximately $460 million, and our net cash outlay was $361 million, with the difference funded by joint venture working capital. Our off-balance sheet lease guarantees for Fab equipment totaled $738 million at the end of Q2.

We expect the mix of non-captive memory to be higher in Q3 than in Q2. And if the Japanese yen remains at current levels, this will also put some sequential pressure on our margins in the second half for the portion of our wafer purchases that is unhedged.", "Our Q3 non-GAAP product gross margin is forecasted at 38% to 40%, and total non-GAAP gross margin, including license and royalty, is forecasted at 42% to 44%. Currently, our gross margin expectations for Q4 are similar to Q3, leading to overall second half gross margin forecast higher than our previous expectations.", "Our non-GAAP operating expense forecast for the third quarter is $230 million to $240 million, with the increase coming primarily from a full quarter of Pliant expenses and certain increases in sales and marketing spending.", "For the full year, we now expect total non-GAAP operating expenses between $875 million and $900 million, up from our original guidance for 2011 of $850 million, due primarily to the acquisition of Pliant and the technology investments that we entered into with Toshiba in Q1. We expect Q3 other income of $5 million to $10 million, and a non-GAAP tax rate of 33%.", "Our estimate of 2011 capital investment in fab and non-fab equipment remains unchanged at $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, and the estimated cash requirement for these investments remains at $800 million to $900 million for the year, of which we have spent $361 million in the first half.", "In summary, we are extremely pleased with our second quarter results and our outlook for continued revenue growth and robust profitability in the second half of the year.", "We will now open the call for your questions.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Anthony, can you open the floor for questions, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "I was wondering if you could provide a little bit of an update about pricing trends you're seeing, in general, for the market overall right now. Maybe give us an update on what percentage of your shipments were TLC NAND and what relative differences you're seeing between TLC and MLC pricing now.", "Judy Bruner", "Let me start with the pricing. First, I want to point out that there was a fair amount of variability in pricing during the quarter really starting at the end of Q1 in response to the earthquake tragedy in Japan. And so in response to that, there was actually somewhat of a surge in pricing and then pricing began to normalize later in the second quarter. And if you look at various pricing indicators that are published out there and look at them on a year-over-year basis, the price decline on a year-over-year basis is not out of line with the cost reduction that the industry is able to generate. So we believe that, that is indicative of the industry being in relative supply-demand balance.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "As regarding X3, the utilization of X3 for our business continues to be slightly above 50% in terms of our total bed utilization. And as we have always said, SanDisk, through its deep system expertise built over last 20 years, is really able to utilize X3 across multiple product platforms and get it to deliver the reliability and the performance specifications that others may be delivering with X2 memory in the industry. So really, when we sell our X3 in the marketplace, our X3 products compete very well with the X2 products from others and we hold pricing power with our X3 products. Certainly, in some cases, particularly related to certain, let's say, embedded product platforms et cetera, we may have situations where as part of the incentive for the customer to move towards X3, which is our competitive advantage, we may have some sharing of the benefit there.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And then as a follow-up, post the Pliant acquisition, can you talk a little about how you see the SSD ramp for you from here, when SSDs' shipments might be more than 5% of revenues? And then as you look out a couple of years, how big as a fraction of your total sales it might be?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So we are not going to break out the specifics in terms of exact timeframes of when it exceeds certain percentage of the revenue. For 2011, while we are making great progress with SSD, particularly related to our modular SSD and thin palm [ph] factor platforms, and now with the acquisition of Pliant, the SSD opportunity really is building up nicely for us in the enterprise storage as well. But for 2011, it remains a relatively small portion of our revenue, although an increasing portion. And we certainly look at building this into a meaningful, strong revenue base for the company in the future. And we expect a broad set of SSD product offerings to start driving growth of SSD revenue in a more meaningful way for us in 2012 and beyond.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Daniel Amir with Lazard Capital Markets.", "Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "A couple of questions here. First of all, Judy, can you give us of any idea on current -- in terms of the gross margin guidance, how should we look at kind of the different parts that are impacting the margins here in Q3? And also kind of the take how you kind of raised your Q4 gross margins as well from your previous expectation. Is that really related more to the captive, non-captive mix or the Fab 5 starting costs or anything else?", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. As we look at the Q3 gross margin, as I indicated, we will have a full quarter of Fab 5 startup costs in the third quarter relative to just one month in the second quarter. So that's a key factor. And then also, we would expect that our non-captive usage will likely increase in the third quarter relative to the second quarter. And I'll let you know that in the second quarter, our non-captive was between 5% and 10% of our overall mix and it probably will be closer to 10% in the third quarter. And then I also mentioned, of course, that about half of our wafer purchases are unhedged, that's a strategy that we entered into and that we communicated at the beginning of the year. And so there is potential variability there in the second half as well based on the yen to dollar exchange rate. So those are the key factors. Of course, sort of the key unusual factors. Of course, there's also our underlying cost decline, which is being driven primarily by the 24-nanometer transition and then of course, price decline. And as I indicated, we believe that the industry and ourselves are in relative balance in the second half, in the third quarter in particular. And then you asked about the fourth quarter? And generally, we will still continue to have Fab 5 startup costs in cost of sales impacting gross margins in the fourth quarter. At this time, I don't want to be too much more specific about the other factors for the fourth quarter.", "Daniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Great. And one other question. In terms of kind of the outlook on the retail market, it looks like the retail business has kind of possibly -- I've seen a strong quarter here in the June quarter following a year where it's been a bit challenging. Are you seeing now a turnaround in the retail business? Is it really driven by emerging markets? I mean, if you can give any commentary around the retail business, that would be helpful.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "I think certainly, emerging markets are contributing to strong growth of our retail business. In fact, on a year-over-year basis, the retail business in the emerging markets grew faster than the rest of the business, and it contributes about 20% of our total retail business at this point. And we are doing really very well in terms of gaining shares in the emerging markets. And as I said in the prepared remarks, China, India, Brazil, Middle East, a lot of markets that are developing nations where SanDisk is doing well, we are well entrenched in terms of our sales and marketing efforts and channel penetration in those regions. And the gains in our sales of retail are also coming from nice mix shift toward our high-performance cards. Our Ultra and Extreme products are doing very well, in general, across all markets. So even in those pockets, where, let's say, consumer sentiment is somewhat weak and not fully bad, like North America market and certain parts of Europe, SanDisk really continues to do well in terms of market share. And so some of the key factors also include our brand premium, our brands commands a premium in all geographies as well. So we are very pleased with how we are driving our retail business, how we are maintaining and growing our shares in the regions of the world, as well as the complete product portfolio of mobile, of imaging cards, USB flash drives that's continuing to do well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Daniel Berenbaum with MKM Partners.", "Ada Menaker", "This is Ada Menaker for Dan Berenbaum. Could you go over some of the puts and takes in demand drivers for the remainder of the year? What could make things better, what could make things worse?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So on the demand driver side, certainly, mobile phones and tablet categories will continue to drive majority of our demand in the second half of the year. SSD revenue, as we said, will continue to grow nicely for us as well. We continue to see that demand for our modular SSD and with our enterprise SSD as well now, in enterprise storage with customer design wins and increasing customer penetration will continue to do well as well. And we will expect typical seasonality in the retail business in the fourth quarter as well.", "Ada Menaker", "And for the follow-up, could you talk about the progress TOC [ph] is making in embedded?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Embedded, as we have said, we have strong design wins on the embedded side. And embedded business particularly the iNAND business, is growing very well for us and we expect this to continue to be a strong driver of our revenue base in the future as well. And again, for embedded, either we have design wins in mobile platforms and tablets and of course, we are doing well there, but there's even other applications and that includes -- like connected TVs, set-top boxes, e-book readers, et cetera. We are actually driving on all fronts and getting momentum on embedded there with our leading-edge eMMC products.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Atif Malik with Morgan Stanley.", "Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley", "I have a series of simple questions. The first one, what percentage of your business is commodity and what percentage of your business sticky or application-specific? And the reason I ask the question is Hynix reported yesterday and they had a pretty similar OEMs-to-retail mix, 70:30, similar to yours, but they showed a more significant price decline of 19% in the quarter. So what percentage of your product business you consider as commodity and what is more sticky or application-specific?", "Judy Bruner", "Well, I'm not going to give you a specific percentage in terms of commodity or non-commodity, but let me point out that our embedded business within our OEM channel, as you know, has grown significantly over the last couple of years, and is definitely now over 40% of our OEM business. And so embedded definitely has a lot of stickiness with our customers. And also, we do a very good job of really differentiating our products in terms of performance level. So we have our good, better, best, and we've had that for a long time in retail, that's part of what gives us our price premium in retail. And now, we've really taken that strategy to other parts of our business, including our embedded business, as Sanjay pointed out. So really, I think those are 2 key areas of differentiation for us. Also, keep in mind, we've really diversified our customer and channel base over the last couple of years, and that allows us to really optimize where we sell our product in any given period.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "And I'll also point out that we definitely continue to focus on increasing differentiation and value-add of our products, particularly with respect to content. We do have product offerings that you, for example, heard about Cricket, Muve Music, you've seen our Service Delivery Cards doing well in that area. Of course, these are small, and these kind of trends take a long time to really build up into a meaningful opportunity. But we really continue to engage with all the leading key players in the ecosystem to continue to drive increasing differentiation. Of course now, the enterprise storage business will be meaningful and strong, highly differentiated, high-margin opportunity for us going forward, because this really requires very high level of quality, requires you to have good control of flash memory technology and manufacturing, and a product roadmap that meets the customer requirements, very demanding enterprise customer requirements, and they put you through long cycles of qualification. So that's another large differentiated opportunity that's building up for us, which is definitely by no means is commodity, and we are well positioned for growth in that market.", "Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley", "Great. And Judy, just a quick follow-up. Thanks for providing the color on the margins for the fourth quarter. So if I assume everything and all else being equal, cost reductions are in line with price declines for next year, what kind of improvement in product gross margins can you get from the one-time event this year reversing into next year? Basically, where will we be at the end of the year in terms of the negative impact from one-time events except -- minus the yen impact?", "Judy Bruner", "It's clearly too early to give any specific gross margin guidance for next year, and I don't pretend to be able to predict the movement of the yen for next year. But the other factors, Fab 5 startup costs should be a favorable trend for us in 2012. There may be a little bit of Fab 5 startup costs that continue in the first quarter in gross margins, but largely, they should go away next year. And so that will be favorable for us. And then, non-captive, of course, is another thing that's difficult to predict at this point in terms of our non-captive usage for next year, in part, because we've not made any decision as to further expansion of Fab 5 beyond the initial phase of expansion that we're doing within Phase 1 of Fab 5. So there's a number of unknowns at this point in order to predict any kind of gross margin. But the Fab 5 startup costs should be a favorable trend.", "Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley", "Good. And one last one. There's some investors, Sanjay, that are confused at offerings like iCloud by Apple will lower the amount of NAND content that you need on your storage devices like smartphones and tablets, but with Apple MacBook -- with the new MacBook Series, is actually increasing the amount of NAND content in this MacBook Air. So I just want to get just your thoughts on these offerings by Google and Apple, what impact will this have on the growth of the NAND content?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We really look at the cloud as a win-win for SanDisk. When you look at clouds, as there are more connected smart devices across the globe, you need -- there will be more content on the cloud, and certainly, it will require faster access to that content on the cloud, which means increasing opportunity for flash storage on the cloud. Because flash is what, ultimately, can really deliver the high-performance, as well as all the other benefits related to power, et cetera, and high reliability that flash is known for. So first of all, with respect to cloud, we look at it as a great opportunity for flash on the cloud. As the cloud gets bigger, flash opportunity will get bigger, and with our recent acquisition of Pliant, we are really excited about addressing that proportionately. And now regarding the mobile devices, we believe that mobile devices will also continue to require an increasing amount of flash in order to really give you, deliver you the experience that consumers have come to expect. Because as there are more smart, connected devices and more data content on the cloud, there will be more mobile Internet traffic, which will create bandwidth limitation from the network where storage in all the mobile device will play a key role in really making your access of content fast from anytime, anywhere. Specifically about iCloud, let me just point out that iCloud actually helps you really update your data in all of your devices, particularly Apple devices, your iPhone, your tablet, your Mac, it helps you update the data. It really helps you do it effortlessly and seamlessly. So we look at it as a duplication of flash between the multiple devices you own. So that obviously drives higher capacity, higher requirement for flash in the mobile devices. And this feature of being able to update your latest content in your mobile devices also means that creating content and sharing content becomes easier and simpler to use, which will also mean that you will have -- you'll be generating more content and driving even higher need for flash storage. So we really look at these trends as very positive from the point of your flash on the cloud, as well as flash in the mobile devices, and we see increasing trend of flash utilization on both fronts.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Win Cramer with Avian Securities.", "Win Cramer", "A couple of questions. I believe last quarter at the Analyst Day, you talked about cost savings for the year being roughly 30%, but it looks like you're tracking ahead of that. Has that since changed?", "Judy Bruner", "Actually, the cost savings is still in that range. You're right, I did talk about a range of 30% plus or minus 3 points for the year. And our first half is basically in that range of 30% year-over-year cost reduction. I would point out that actually, we're in that range and doing well against that metric despite the fact that we had the earthquake and power outage in Q1, which, of course, was not known or predicted at the time that I gave that range. So we feel quite good about our cost reduction this year.", "Win Cramer", "As my follow-up, could you possibly break out, as a percentage of your OEM business, what is going towards tablets in Q2 and possibly Q3?", "Judy Bruner", "Really, we aren't breaking that out. And I would tell you that it is difficult to break that out because many of our products, iNAND as an example, get used in either a phone or a tablet from the same customer. And sometimes also go through distribution, and it's not known which end-phone or which end-tablet they go into. But we are designed into a large number of tablets, and tablets is actually, we know, a very big driver of the growth in our mobile business, which is now 57%, as Sanjay pointed out, of our total revenue.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Bob Gujavarty with Deutsche Bank.", "Bobby Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank AG", "Just a quick one on Pliant. Are you able to source the NAND for Pliant products internally? And the second part of that question is, if not, could it potentially be a gross margin additive once you transition those products to your own NANDs?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So we use, currently, non-captive memory for Pliant products, and over time, we do plan to transition to our own flash memory. And obviously, that will definitely provide benefits to the gross margin of the enterprise products. And that is one of the key synergies of this deal, of the Pliant acquisition. It really gives us the benefit of being able to produce very high reliability and lowest-cost flash and apply it to our benefit on the enterprise products.", "Bobby Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank AG", "Great. And just a quick follow-up. This maybe a little bit, maybe too long a question for this forum, but it's a bit more strategic. SanDisk traditionally has been kind of a branded products company. You pursued price elasticity to drive unit demand of your own branded products. And that made sense. But in this world where the OEM business is perhaps growing in importance, you're price elasticity doesn't drive necessarily your unit demand because the OEM determines the final price of the product. So my question basically is, does your pricing strategy change given the shift from retail to OEM where perhaps you need to be a little less focused on price elasticity because of those different dynamics?", "Judy Bruner", "One thing that I would point out is that you're talking about price elasticity with respect to unit demand and there is a link there and a factor, but keep in mind that price elasticity is often really referring to the average capacity of the product in response to declines in ASP per gigabyte. And we believe that the elasticity factor in terms of growth in average capacity is strong in both the retail and OEM segments of our business. But clearly, in terms of our pricing strategy, we are managing our pricing very carefully to try to maintain our margins and try to pass on, over time, the benefit of the cost reductions that we're able to generate for our products.", "Bobby Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank AG", "Fair enough, maybe just to -- maybe to put it more simply, though, if an OEM -- if you pass along a price decline to a retail customer in a SanDisk product, the customer receives that benefit directly. If you pass along a price decline to an OEM, the customer may not see it. The OEM may just pocket it. So how do you -- how does your strategy change in that environment? It's fundamentally a different channel and a different customer base.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We definitely continue to drive for higher value for our products. And pricing strategy is definitely determined, of course, by competition as well, and our desire to continue to grow the applications for flash memory, create new market opportunities as well. So really, where pricing strategy is a fairly complex topic, and we certainly not going to get into discussions on how we approach it, and there are many fundamentals that influence pricing, competition, industry environment, but we are always focused on driving profitable growth of our business.", "Operator", "We'll take your next question from Doug Freedman with Gleacher.", "Doug Freedman - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "Judy, you mentioned that while we don't know what's going to happen to the yen next year, we're now halfway through the year, and you did have a pretty meaningful hedge on this year. Any thought on putting on a hedge for next year and when would you make that decision?", "Judy Bruner", "Actually, that's something that we're studying right now, and we'll be making the decisions sometime in the second half. I can't say exactly when, but that is something that we are focused on evaluating currently.", "Doug Freedman - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "Okay. Great. If I could, I understand what's happening in the consumer SSD space. You guys made some pretty bullish comments about expecting it to be a very nice growth market. Can you talk a little bit about what you think the shape of that curve might look like from a demand perspective? Is this something that -- are we going to reach a certain price per gigabyte delivered to the consumer that will cause a rapid shift in the percentage that OEMs will move rotational drives towards SSDs? Or is this something that you think is going to move a few percentage a year? If you could give us some color on the conversations you're having with your customers that would be helpful.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So as we had said before, based on our interactions with customers, we believe that flash needs to enable a-dollar-a-gigabyte price point to the consumer in order to begin to accelerate the SSD demand on the client side. And we believe the technology advancement and the cost reductions will help enable to get there next year. And of course, as in the future, there is continued price benefits, enabled by cost reductions from technology advancements. It will continue to drive increasing adoption of SSDs in the years beyond 2012 as well. So I think it really is more about getting to a-dollar-a-gigabyte and delivering the specs and attractive capacity point, which we believe will start happening on the notebook, PCs, et cetera, starting next year, where you're going to start seeing greater rate of replacement of hard disk drives by solid state drives.", "Doug Freedman - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "Is there any way I can get you to help us on what percentage you think next year's replacement rate might be?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "What I can point to is third-party reports, which say that in the client PCs by 2014 or 2015 timeframe, 20% of the disk drives will be solid-state based. Of course, this will continue to depend on the pricing environment of the NAND flash in the years ahead as well.", "Operator", "We'll hear next from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel Nicholas.", "Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I'm just wondering on Fab 5, as those new wafers come out, what's the qualification process? Are these -- will these die already be qualified to go into SSDs or will they be sold more on a retail level?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So as the Fab 5 production starts, we will work on qualifying the products in both of our end products. Yes, initially, a lot of the products do tend to go into the retail side, but we really very quickly move it over to OEM side of the business as well. Regarding SSDs, over time, we definitely plan to use Fab 5 supply in SSDs as well.", "Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Can you give us an idea of the timeframe? Is that, when you say it's short, is that 3 months or 1 month or...", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So these are our competitive details here. But the point is that we have enough capacity from Fab 3, Fab 4. And as you can see, we are somewhat supply constrained, and as Fab 5 output begins to come, we will definitely be utilizing that Fab 5 output across the product platforms. At the end of this year, the Fab 5 output will still be no more than 10% of our total output. So I would expect that through the remainder of this year, SSDs will primarily be using Fab 3 and Fab 4 output.", "Kevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I see. And maybe if you could just give us an idea of what the decision process will be for Phase 2 of the buildout, and how much lag time do you need to know before you make the decision?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Regarding Phase 2, we will make a decision based on our continuing assessment of customer demands. And again, when we say Phase 2, I want to be, actually, clear here to avoid any confusion. Right now, we are expanding capacity in Phase I. And as Judy pointed out, that even within Phase I, we have still lot of available space where we have not put in place plans for further capacity expansion yet. So we have plans in place for capacity expansion only in part of the Phase 1 at this point. And once the current plan of capacity expansion in Phase 1 is complete, we'll be less than 50% utilized in the Phase 1. So the second part of Phase 1, the decisions related to capacity expansion, will likely be made sometime this fall. And again, they will be made based on our assessment of customer demands. Fab 5 has been -- the building of Fab 5 will be in 2 phases: the Phase 1 and Phase 2. And what we call the Phase 2 of Fab 5, the building has not yet started construction. So I hope I am clear in terms of the Phase 1 aspect and Phase 2 aspect. What we call Phase 2 at Fab 5 has not started construction of the building yet. Within Phase 1, we have partial expansion started in and committed to, and the remainder of the expansion within Phase 1, we have not decided on the timing of it yet. We expect to make the decision sometime this fall.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ryan Goodman with CLSA.", "Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets", "Longer-term question, just curious if you think that NAND is becoming less commoditized going forward, just giving increased complexity of the technology. And if you do, I'd be curious how do you differentiate in tomorrow's market? And on top of that, how do you monetize the differentiation and impact the P&L? And then finally, do you think the industry could see some consolidation down the line for those vendors who may fall behind in the technology?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So regarding differentiation with NAND, as we have talked about before, Adaptive Flash Management techniques are really key competitive for SanDisk that we have pioneered here over the course of last few years. And those are really the techniques that are giving us meaningful penetration and strong position on the embedded side of the business. These are the techniques that actually allow you to understand the customer's application and tweak, if you will, the features of the NAND Flash memory or NAND Flash solution to really ultimately help the customer deliver the best experience to their devices as well. So we really feel very good about our continued roadmap of advancements in the Adaptive Flash Management techniques so that's one example of how we are driving differentiation and strengthening our position on the embedded side. Other examples, of course, our opportunities related to content and certainly, opportunities on the enterprise side, also leveraging in the client SSD side, thin form factors, that we have been utilizing. So I think our strategy of continuing to drive differentiation is working well. Regarding second part of your question, on consolidation, et cetera, I mean, clearly, flash will become more difficult to produce in the future and system expertise will be an important part. And I think that will clearly help determining relative position of different peers in the marketplace in the future. We feel very good about our position in that regard with our strong system expertise.", "Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets", "And then just on monetizing the differentiation. So the Adaptive Flash Management, should I be thinking of -- and other thing along those line, should I be thinking that this is going to be more of a share gain tool? Or is this something that could slow price declines where you can get paid more for your ASPs? Or should I be thinking more in the historical sense that, I guess, keeping up with the technology is more of a cost saver than helping on the revenue line?", "Judy Bruner", "I would just add that I think the differentiation that Sanjay has been talking about does have the ability to help us on the share side in terms of stickiness, and also help us on the margin side in terms of maintaining that higher and more consistent margins over time. So those are clear goals for us as we try to further increase the differentiation of our products through all the different avenues that Sanjay just described.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "And again, we have several value-add product techniques and product portfolio. So it really depends from product to product, as well as from customer to customer in terms of how we position it in terms of share gain, pricing power, et cetera.", "Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets", "Okay. And then, just one other question, quick follow up on the royalty business. I saw that went up a little bit this quarter, and then going kind of flattish for a couple of quarters. Can you just give some color on that? Like what -- I don't know if you can give an exact percent, but about what portion of that is tied to revenue trends versus just being fixed licensing payments and how we should be thinking about that in terms of growth over the next few years?", "Judy Bruner", "I would tell you that the majority of it is tied, over time, to revenue of our licensees. And so generally, there's a large portion of it that will vary with revenue in the industry.", "Operator", "We'll take your next question from Hans Mosesmann from Raymond James.", "Brian Peterson - Raymond James", "This is Brian Peterson filling in for Hans. Just a question on the guidance. It's a little bit lower than I would've been looking for. Can you maybe size how much of that is due to constraints?", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. You're talking about the revenue guidance, I assume. As we said, we do believe that we are supply constrained, and we are purchasing more non-captive or utilizing more non-captive in the third quarter than we did. And so that has factored into our guidance. Keep in mind that we did, as we indicated last quarter, lose some supply in the earthquake and power outage at the end of the first quarter. And that is impacting us. It has caused us to lower our estimate of our bit growth, our captive bit supply growth this year from what we had indicated early in the year in the mid-80% range to now closer to 80%. And so that is a factor in our guidance.", "Operator", "Next question will come from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.", "Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "On the Pliant acquisition and products, along the same lines as the prior caller, do you plan to bring the controller design in-house or are you going to continue to use the ASIC partner? And as you've rolled out your 6-gig SAS drives, what has been the key differentiator on why these drives are gaining more traction versus competitive solutions out there in the market? I mean, my understanding is that, for example, firmware is key for these enterprise drives. I'm just wondering if that's one of the kind of key differentiators.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So regarding the 6-gigabit SAS drives, and we recently announced the HP win there. Certainly, we are leading the industry with those. And yes, I mean, there are several key differentiators. The SAS drives' firmware is a very important factor, and in fact, the Pliant's team has tremendous amount of firmware expertise, not just related to the flash management, where SanDisk brings a lot of value as well, but also, related to the host application and the customer requirements and understanding of the workloads of various enterprise applications and helping the customer tweak the solution and really deliver reliability and performance and the prediction of performance, which are very, very important in enterprise application. So yes, firmware plays a very key role there, and Pliant has tremendous amount of expertise and experience of the several leading team players of many, many years of experience there. Also, on the ASIC side, some of the other enterprise storage solutions hardware, they have PDAs. Pliant uses it's solution with its own ASIC and that, again, is the competitive advantage in that space. And now, with the -- our acquisition of Pliant, certainly, our deep understanding of the future roadmap of flash memory and the technology constrictions associated with that, and being able to apply those early enough in the enterprise storage cycle, will be yet another strong benefit for us.", "Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Just one follow-up, and I apologize if you articulated this earlier in the call. But can you just give us an update on the 19-Nanometer qualification? And is the team still on track to ramp towards the back half of this year?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So 19-Nanometer is on track, and we will be starting production of 19-Nanometer in third quarter. The volume of 19-Nanometer used for this year will be relatively small, and it will be small toward the end of the year as well, 24-nanometer will remain the vast majority of our output toward the end of the year. And we are in the process of very early stages of 19-Nanometer and the internal qualifications, et cetera.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Uche Orji of UBS.", "Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank", "Just a few really short questions. Judy, your cash level has been building quite steadily. I'd just like to understand how you plan to deploy that cash and whether buyback is something that you have looked at as with the use of cash, just given where, from a violation standpoint, it's orchestrating?", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. As I've indicated before, we're a very capital-intensive business, and we have a fair amount of capital expenditures ahead of us as we build Fab 5 over the next several years. So capital use for our capacity is the #1 use of that cash. And then in addition, we, from time to time, do make strategic investments in other areas and the Pliant acquisition is a good recent example of that. And there can be other kinds of technology investments, such as the technology investment that we made in the first quarter with our partner, Toshiba. So those are the primary intended uses of our cash, which is at a comfortable level. In terms of buybacks, we have done buybacks from time to time, and I don't rule out that, that's something that we could do in the future. We do not, at the present, have a buyback plan in place.", "Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank", "All right. If I look at the -- your ASP future decline, and what we see is around minus 7%. How much of that was from -- whether mix of OEM and embedded versus actual price dilution in retail? And as I look at all these new demand drivers you are talking about, should we start to conclude that it's possible that the ASP will fall less aggressively with cost? I mean, it sounded like there's a lot more product that you have -- getting designed into, which would suggest that it should be less of a commodity in that sense. So I just want to understand how would we should think about how does the pricing volatility for your business should track with this expanded areas of activities for SanDisk.", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. No, I absolutely believe that the diversity of our customers and our channels and the broad range of products that we now offer to our customers helps us to better manage that price decline over time and to minimize the impact. And so yes, I believe that all of that is contributing favorably to our pricing and our profitability.", "Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank", "And then the final part of my question is how much of the amount of the percent is from the mix versus the retail?", "Judy Bruner", "I would tell you that we don't break it out specifically, but the retail decline is oftentimes less than it is in OEM.", "Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And then finally, just on inventories are up 6 days -- approximately 6 days, how much of this was from Pliant? This was your product, you would have given comment while being supply constrained.", "Judy Bruner", "I'm sorry, Uche, I couldn't quite [indiscernible].", "Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank", "You're inventories are up about 6 days, I just want to how much of that increase was from Pliant versus you building out products into the third quarter. I'm just trying to reconcile...", "Judy Bruner", "The inventory -- you're asking about inventory. Yes, right. So the dollar increase in the inventory, you're right, but some of it is the Pliant inventory, and some of it is getting some recovery in terms of Fab output that came relatively late in the quarter and will be used in Q3 in the second half. As I pointed out, our inventory is actually quite lean in terms of our business model and our vertically-integrated business model.", "Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank", "Sure. All right. And then just finally, Pliant, how much was the revenue contribution in Q2 and the estimate for Q3?", "Judy Bruner", "Yes, we're not going to break out the Pliant revenue. And keep in mind that Pliant was only part of SanDisk for 5 weeks during the quarter.", "Operator", "Your last question will come from Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.", "Brett Piira - Caris & Company", "This is Brett Piira for Craig. On the cost reduction side, can you quantify how much it will be in 3Q and 4Q, just similar to 2Q or more or less? Give us the direction.", "Judy Bruner", "Well, I indicated a little earlier that I believe we're still on track for the overall cost reduction for this year that I guided to at our Analyst Day of -- in the range of 30% plus or minus 3 points. And we are at approximately 30% year-over-year for the first half.", "Brett Piira - Caris & Company", "Okay. And then on the embedded side, with handset tablets, just generally speaking, have any programs been pushed out unusually or still on track with -- given the macro backdrop?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "There are many models of smartphones, tablets, et cetera, that are out there. And as we all know, that certain models are successful in the marketplace, others sometimes may not. And we are really engaged with major OEMs on the plethora of model designs with our embedded products. So from time to time, this does happen that certain model launches, et cetera, do get pushed out, but this is really something that we manage on an ongoing basis, all the time throughout the quarter, working closely with our customers to understand their demand trends and making any adjustments that we may need to fulfill their requirements. And this is where definitely the flexibility of having a diversified set of customers, really helps us manage our demand and manage our business as well.", "Judy Bruner", "Craig, I want to just go back to your question on cost reduction to make sure that I clarify that when I say that our cost reduction for the year and also for the first half is expected to be about 30%, and it was about 30% year-over-year in the first half. But that is in -- on an all-in basis, meaning including the impact of Fab 5 startup costs, non-captive purchases, the yen exchange rate and the charges related to the earthquake and power outage, right? So our underlying cost reduction is clearly stronger than that. But all in, our guidance still stands, and we still feel good about it for the year in terms of approximately 30%.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Craig. And I think that brings us to the conclusion of the call. We want to thank everyone for joining us today, and I apologize, it went into overtime. The webcast replay of today's call should be available on our Investor Relations website shortly. Thank you, and have a good evening.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's conference call.

Welcome to Western Digital's Fourth Quarter Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2011. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.", "Bob Blair", "Thank you. I want to mention at the offset that we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning industry conditions in the September quarter, including the total available market for hard drives, customer demand, supply constraints, capacity mix, average selling price and cost of components, expected benefits from and the timing of completion of our planned acquisition of Hitachi GST, growth in the near-line enterprise market, our product offerings in the traditional enterprise market, our position in the branded products market, our expected capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2012, our investments in new products and markets and our financial results expectations for the September quarter, including revenue, gross margin, expenses, tax rate, share count and earnings per share. ", "These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 2, 2011. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events, and you should not assume later in the quarter that the comments we make today are still valid. ", "In addition, references will be made during this call to historical non-GAAP financial measures, as well as forward-looking estimates of non-GAAP financial measures that give effect to our planned acquisition of Hitachi GST. Investors are encouraged to consider the reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures we provide during this call and those that are included in the investor information summary posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. ", "The forward-looking estimates of non-GAAP financial measures that give effect to our planned acquisition of Hitachi GST exclude acquisition-related expenses that we expect to incur in connection with the transaction and following the close of the transaction. Because these acquisition-related items will not be known to us until on or after the closing of the transaction, we are unable to provide information about or a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures. ", "Also as a reminder, until our acquisition of Hitachi GST closes, WD and Hitachi GST remain independent companies. So we will not be taking any questions about HGST's business or financial performance today. ", "I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investors section of WD's website immediately following the conclusion of this call. ", "I now turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, John Coyne.", "John Coyne", "Thanks, Bob. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Tim Leyden, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wolfgang Nickl, our Chief Financial Officer. ", "In the June quarter, we saw stronger-than-anticipated demand with the hard drive industry shipping over 165 million units. This 4% quarter-on-quarter increase contrasts with historical seasonal patterns of 1% to 2% sequential contraction. We believe that the stronger demand was driven by increased adoption of sea freight in the PC supply chain, which creates a long-term leveling of seasonal demand patterns, as well as supply continuity concerns in the aftermath of the Japan earthquake. ", "The industry grew fiscal year volumes 4% to 657 million units, while WD again grew faster than the market at 6%, shipping 207 million hard drives for the year, a 1% share gain reaffirming customer preference for WD's value proposition. ", "This was a tough comparison year for the PC and HDD industries, coming off the recession snapback year of 2010, combined with the slowdown in consumer spending and increased competition for share of consumer spend from devices like smartphones and tablets. ", "We believe that 2012 could be a stronger period for the industry and for WD for several reasons: An acceleration of the commercial PC refresh as part of an overall macro reinvestment cycle; the potential for better consumer confidence translating into stronger discretionary spending; the planned launch of redesigned, feature-rich PCs enabled by Windows 8 and our continued favorable standing with customers as one of the preferred suppliers of the world's most cost-effective storage solutions for the massive amounts of content being generated on the client and in the cloud. ", "In this context, it's important to consider some history. Throughout fiscal '11, we operated close to the bottom of our business model range. Others in the industry struggled even more, reporting results below their published models. Historical cycles show that prolonged periods of below model performance are typically followed by a return-to-business model parameters as suppliers and customers alike recognize the need for industry profitability to drive needed investment in both technology and capacity. WD has repeatedly outperformed as these cyclical corrections occur. ", "Furthermore, upon completion of our acquisition of HGST, we will have a stronger position in the traditional enterprise market, an improved solid state drive lineup and further cost advantage. Thus far, in the regulatory review process, to complete this transaction, we have received clearance from Brazil, Taiwan and Turkey, and we continue to work closely with the remaining agencies. As previously announced, we currently expect the transaction will close in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2011 and our integration planning activities continue on schedule. ", "I will now turn the call over to COO, Tim Leyden, who will describe the operational highlights for the June quarter. Tim?", "Timothy Leyden", "Thank you. As John indicated, demand in the June quarter was stronger than we originally anticipated, with industry unit volume exceeding 165 million hard drives, generating 4% quarter-on-quarter and 6% year-on-year growth, primarily driven by strength in OEM demand. We believe there were 2 main factors behind this. ", "Margin focus across the PC market where lower financing and inventory-carrying costs encouraged increased use of ocean freight, leading to pull-ins of built schedules versus historical seasonal patterns. And fear of supply disruption from the Japan aftermath led to pull-forwards by OEM customers to create inventory buffer on the basis that it is better to be looking at it than looking for it. We now see an industry TAM for calendar 2011 of roughly 670 million units, with the September quarter in the range of 170 million to 175 million. ", "Now turning to WD's performance. We shipped 53.8 million units in the June quarter, up 8% sequentially and 8.2% from the year-ago period, as we work successfully with our supplier partners to overcome post earthquake challenges, again, providing superior availability and value to our customer base. Moderation in ASP declines delivered revenue growth of 7% quarter-on-quarter and 1% year-on-year for the June quarter. ", "Gross margins improved by 130 basis points to 19.5%. However, we need to make further progress on profitability as this margin level continues to be below our business model midpoint and is some 300 basis points below the same period last year. ", "Price declines for the quarter were broadly as we had expected and were less than the seasonal norm. Average product capacity was up only moderately, but higher volumes, tight cost management and improved utilization enabled us to come in above the upper end of our implied gross margin guidance. ", "Revenues totaled $2.4 billion, net income was $158 million and cash flow from operations improved sequentially from $313 million to $447 million. ", "Now turning to market segment performance. In the compute space, units increased to 117 million from 113 million in the March quarter and were up from 111 million in the year-ago quarter. WD shipped 39.2 million units into the compute space in the June quarter compared to 36.3 million units in the March quarter and 37.1 million units in the year-ago quarter. And we grew market share by approximately 1% both sequentially and year-on-year. ", "The near-line enterprise market was up sequentially from 5.6 million to 6.4 million units, and up from 5.1 million units year-on-year. Cloud computing continues to spur growth in this market. The traditional enterprise market, at 8.3 million units, remained flat with the March quarter and was up year-on-year from 7.1 million units as demand in the commercial market remained robust. WD shipped 2.5 million units into the combined enterprise markets in the June quarter, up from approximately 2.3 million in both the March and year-ago quarters. ", "In the traditional enterprise space, we are servicing a limited customer set with our first- and second-generation SAS products, and we are on plan to bring our third-generation product to market within the calendar year. ", "The HDD manufacturers' TAM in the branded product segment came in at 12 million units, down from 13 million units in the March quarter and up from 9.8 million units in the year-ago quarter, as a sequential TAM reduction followed typical seasonal patterns. Year-on-year TAM unit growth in this segment was strong. WD shipped 5.7 million units into this market in the June quarter, down from 6.4 million units in the March quarter and up from 5 million units in the year-ago quarter. Competition is particularly intense in the branded segment, as competitors seek to improve their share positions, and we continue to compete strongly through differentiating product features and strong brand equity. ", "In the DVR market segment, the TAM was an estimated 14.4 million units, up sequentially from 12.9 million in the March quarter and up from 13.2 million in the year-ago quarter. WD shipped 6.5 million units into this market in the June quarter, up from 4.8 million in the March quarter and up from 5.3 million in the year-ago quarter. WD's product capabilities and ability to respond quickly to customer needs helped us grow in this segment where HDDs offer an efficient and cost-effective solution for storing and retrieving video content. ", "The remaining balance of the TAM is represented by gaming, automotive and 1.8-inch drives. Inventories in the HDD supply chain exiting the quarter were below historical run rate levels in each segment. ", "Now turning to the September quarter. The market visibility is cloudy both from a demand and supply viewpoint due to the supply uncertainty and the pull forward of demand that I mentioned earlier. In contrast to the HDD supply chain inventory status, we believe that inventory levels continued to build in the PC OEM supply chain as the switch from air freight to sea freight continued in an effort to save transportation costs. OEMs continued to pull product on the basis of concerns about supply and their historical extrapolation of demand expectations for back-to-school and the holiday season. ", "In our other served markets in the September quarter, we expect typical seasonal patterns, which are: A branded products volume increase; a DVR volume reduction and flattish volume in the Enterprise segment. ", "Now turning to our product lineup. We are now shipping the WD Scorpio 1 terabyte, a 2-disk, 2.5-inch drive, the first in a range of products that utilize our 500 gigabytes-per-platter technology. In our Branded Products segment, we continue to lead the industry in volume shipments of USB 3. In our Consumer Electronics segment, we released WD AV versions of our 2.5 terabyte and 3 terabyte SATA hard drives. ", "I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang Nickl for a review of our Q4 financial performance and our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Wolfgang?", "Wolfgang Nickl", "Thank you, Tim. A summary of financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, which we will be updating with our Q1 guidance after this call. ", "For the June quarter, revenue was $2.4 billion, up 1% from the prior year and up 7% sequentially. Hard drive shipments totaled 53.8 million units, up 8% from both the prior-year period and the March quarter. ", "Revenue from sales of WD TV Media Players, WD Livewire Network Kits and solid-state drives totaled approximately $33 million, up 23% from the prior year and seasonally down 34% from the March quarter. ", "These results are above the upper end of the guidance we provided during our April investor call due primarily to our ability to meet unexpected customer demand during a period of uncertain industry supply capabilities. ", "Hard drive average selling price was approximately $44 per unit, down $3 from the year-ago quarter and $1 from the March quarter. ", "Revenue from sales of our branded products, including WD TV and WD Livewire products was $382 million, down 4% from the year-ago quarter due to an aggressive pricing environment, as well as a continued shift from 3.5- to 2.5-inch products. Revenue was down seasonally by 13% from the March quarter. There was one customer, Dell, that comprised 10% or more of our total revenue. ", "Geographically, demand in Asia was particularly strong this quarter as we grew to 60% of revenue from 54% in the March quarter, while Americas and Europe each declined. ", "Our decision to strongly support OEM customers in the aftermath of the Japan earthquake resulted in OEM sales representing 55% of revenue, up from 47% in the March quarter, while the distribution and retail channels each contributed lower percentages of revenue. ", "Our gross margin for the quarter was 19.5%, down from 22.5% in the year-ago quarter and up from 18.2% in the March quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in gross margin by 130 basis points is a function of firmer pricing in the client compute market, coupled with increased utilization of manufacturing assets due to higher volume. Like-for-like price decline was approximately 2% for the June quarter. ", "R&D and SG&A spending totaled $297 million in the June quarter as compared to $242 million and $252 million in the year-ago and March quarters, respectively. The June quarter included $32 million for acquisition-related expenses and unrelated litigation accruals, whereas the prior-year quarter included $27 million for litigation accruals and the March quarter included $10 million of acquisition-related expenses. ", "Excluding these items, R&D and SG&A would have totaled $265 million or 11% of revenue in the June quarter, versus $215 million or 9% of revenue in the year-ago quarter and $242 million or 10.7% of revenue in the March quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase is primarily a function of increased investments in new product and technology development and higher incentive compensation expenses. ", "Net interest and other nonoperating expense was $2 million, including $2 million of acquisition-related debt commitment fees. Excluding these fees, net interest and other nonoperating expense would have been 0. ", "Tax expense for the June quarter was $12 million dollars or 7.1% of pretax income. ", "Our net income for the June quarter totaled $158 million or $0.67 per share as compared to $265 million or $1.13 per share for the year-ago quarter and $146 million or $0.62 per share in the March quarter. The June quarter included a combined $35 million for acquisition-related expenses and litigation accruals, whereas the prior-year quarter included $27 million of litigation accruals, and the March quarter included $10 million of acquisition-related expenses. Excluding these items, non-GAAP net income for the June quarter totaled $193 million or $0.81 per share, as compared to $292 million or $1.24 per share in the year-ago quarter and $156 million or $0.66 per share in the March quarter. ", "Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash conversion cycle for the June quarter was 0 days. This consisted of 46 days of receivables, 27 days of inventory or 13 turns and 73 days of payables. We generated $447 million in cash from operations during the June quarter and our free cash flow totaled $294 million, reflecting strong sales linearity and tight asset management.

Capital expenditures for fiscal '11 totaled $778 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal '11 totaled $602 million. ", "For fiscal '12, we expect capital expenditures will be at the upper end of our business model range of between 7% and 8% of revenue as we complete the 6- to 8-inch conversion of our wafer fab facility.

As Tim mentioned, we forecast a total available market of between 170 million and 175 million units, which is below historical seasonality as OEMs have built some extra inventory in Q4 fiscal year '11 to ensure security of supply and optimized transportation costs.

Our guidance does not include acquisition-related expenses. ", "Based on these assumptions, our guidance for fiscal Q1 is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range from $2.425 billion to $2.525 billion; R&D and SG&A spending of approximately $250 million, excluding acquisition-related expenses. We expect our tax rate to be in the middle of our business model range of 6% to 9%. We anticipate our share count to be approximately 238 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $0.90 and $1 for the September quarter, which excludes acquisition-related expenses. ", "Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC", "I guess, the first thing I wanted to ask is, I guess, just on the rare earth issue. Obviously, you guys, did a better job of offsetting somehow or absorbing the costs than Seagate did last night. Can you talk about some of the dynamics, I guess, that have allowed you to do that seemingly in the June quarter and the September quarter guidance? And I know you're not giving December quarter guidance. If you could give us any sense of the degree to which sort of those levers might be able to sort of continue through the balance of the second half of the year?", "John Coyne", "Yes, Ananda. This is John. On an overall basis, the rare earth materials that affect both the magnetic components in our drives and the processing of substrates for our media are -- have 2 issues. One is overall availability and consequent to that, the price for that availability. The market -- about 30% of the reserves exist in China. About 95% of the production is in China. 15 years ago, that was roughly 1/3 China; 1/3 U.S.; 1/3 rest of world. The year-on-year reductions in allocation quotas for export from China have been significant over the last 3 years and the trajectory looks to continue. As the price has risen, there's more interest in the rest of the world in terms of reopening mines and processing plants to bring further supplies to the market. We continue to work very closely with our suppliers, multi-tier in our supply chain to secure supply and to manage cost. We continue to focus on the controllables, that we manage the design of the product and therefore, the usage of these materials. The processing in the supply chain, to manufacture the components where you acquire and so we're working there on process efficiency and reutilization of scrap materials and so on. And through those various means, we've worked with our supply chain to moderate some of the influence of the raw material increases. We have not fully countervailed those pressures, and so we've gone to our customers and we've sought their help in reflecting, in our pricing, the cost increase which we could not offset in other areas. And we'll continue to do that as we march into the future here. We'll continue to try to manage down usage, to improve efficiency and utilization throughout the chain and find other means within our overall control to continually address cost improvement, which is quarterly order of business, daily order of business here. And should all of that not successfully drive down the cost of a hard drive, we'll work with our customers to ensure that we continue to provide a very fundamenta,l, effective technology to the marketplace that enables the revenue streams of all of our companies.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC", "Okay, that's helpful. If I can just ask one clarification, if I could, John. Any -- I guess, would you care to give us any sense of how much of a headwind, gross margin headwind the rare earth might have been this quarter? And is it too early to get any sort of sense of, I guess for, sort of for the December quarter -- I mean, it sounds like you feel like you have pretty sound principals around working with the suppliers and with your customers in offsetting some of the costs. Is there any chance that we can get surprised, I guess, by any meaningful degree as we move through the fall in the degree to which you're able to work with the suppliers in those processes and [indiscernible]?", "John Coyne", "Well, I think the issue here is there's always a certain time lag in this process. And the vulnerability is to a very rapid increase in pricing of the materials. And recognize in these kinds of situations, there are 2 issues. One is the price rise that relates to the demand versus the supply equation. And we think we were helped last quarter by the disarray in the Japanese automotive industry, which reduced demand for magnets in automotive temporarily. But that will come back, as the supply chain to the automotive industry in Japan recovers on the semiconductor side, primarily, that will enable recovery in the automotive build numbers, which will place an increased demand on the available magnetic materials. So that's one driver, potential driver of cost. The other is typically, when any traded commodity goes short, we get financial interests that jump into that pool and attempt to make the commodity even scarcer and make a profit by driving up that price. And while the fact that this is a Chinese government-controlled quota system may help in that regard, there's always vulnerability to that effect as well. And we're working to try to manage all of that. And I think our customers fully understand that supply chain and those issues and fully understand the vital contribution of our technology to their businesses and we'll work it out.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "A couple as well. First question, there's a debate out there with regard to what the TAM looks like for the September quarter. I notice you guys have laid out 170 million to 175 million. You clearly pointed to a lack of good visibility through the full quarter. Can you tell us what your assumption or what underlying assumption you're making with regard to trends into the month of September relative to historical trends to get at that guidance where you're at -- that you've laid out?", "Timothy Leyden", "Yes, this is Tim. What we believe is that the inventory that's being carried on the ocean, people have made a call on that on the basis of historical extrapolation of demand. And they are continuing to put product on the ocean. They will wait until back-to-school season in order to see whether back-to-school meets their expectations. And on the basis of that, if it meets the expectations, they'll continue to put product on the ocean for the holiday season, we believe. If the back-to-school season is less than their expectations, they will more than likely switch to -- they'll watch for demand and then they'll switch probably to air freight in order to be able to satisfy the needs of the market. And that will happen in either direction. So based upon that, we believe that the inventory that was there at the beginning of the June quarter is still in there. We think that there was a slight build, if anything, during the course of the June quarter. So consequently, we think that there is that extra inventory out there, which is more a change in the way people are managing, the way customers are managing their inventory than anything else. They're basically taking advantage of low financing rates and, of course, they're trying to avoid the air transportation costs. So consequently, we think that with that in mind, there normally would have been -- what we would anticipate on a seasonal basis with historical trends, probably be up somewhere in the region of 10% to 12%. And under this scenario, we believe that some of that inventory buffer that's in there would allow the growth that we are looking at, which is somewhere in the region of about 5% or so.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay, that's helpful. And then coming off the heels of your competitor last night, I'd be curious of where you guys stand. I know you've made some announcements this week with regard to -- when you guys make announcements, 500 gig-per-platter, 2.5 and then also 1 terabyte, 3.5-inch, can you update us exactly where you're at and whether or not you've seen similar challenge as far as time to maturity or time to cost effectiveness, if you will, on those platform ramps?", "John Coyne", "I think -- this is John again. The WD approach to the deployment of new technology is to focus primarily on deploying that technology, where it serves a specific need in the marketplace, such as a new capacity point that has been previously inaccessible or, as in the case of our announcement last night, a -- the 1 terabyte in the 9-millimeter form factor, which is restricted to 2 disks. And therefore, deploying the advanced technology in that product enables us to offer a 1-terabyte capacity into the notebook environment, which is restricted to the 9.25-millimeter form factor. We then -- we tend to manage our large-scale deployment of the technology, which is purely to address cost on existing capacity points. We manage that very much on the metrics, and we pace the introduction of that technology and the ramp of that technology to return the maximum financial advantage to the company. And I think you've seen how we've managed that over the last 5, in fact, 10 years. It's a very effective, proven formula, and we continue to prosecute that formula.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay, great. And then final question from me and I'll cede the floor. On the pending acquisitions, I know you've talked about some regulatory approvals you've gotten. How do we think about timing of other key regulatory approvals? I mean, is there's a specific time frame -- October, November that we should be looking for as kind of driving this to that close of Q4?", "John Coyne", "I think based on the published time frames for each of the agencies, the U.S. process is moving along a track that's going to be in the September time frame. And the European process is moving along a track that looks like the October time frame. And we expect all regulatory agencies reviews to be complete within the calendar year.", "Operator", "Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC", "Just a couple questions. We've seen increasing shipments by ocean freight from the OEMs for a number of quarters now. And so it seems to be here to stay. Can you estimate in any way what the industry's total volume that might be shipped by ocean freight is today? Is it a substantial amount such that it creates enough confusion about what inventory is actually out there? And then secondly, if ocean freight does continue, what is the new normal for seasonality as it seems to level out to quarters? I mean, can then -- can you keep your CapEx different than it has been in the past because of that?", "John Coyne", "Good questions, Rich. We're working on trying to understand the split, the air-ocean split. I think it's above 20% today, maybe in the 30% range and rising. In perspective, the PC industry ships over 1 million units a day. So -- and you consider a 4- to 6-week difference in the supply chain, air versus ocean to -- from Asia to Europe and the U.S. So if you go on the 4-week delta and take 10% movement between air and ocean, you're talking 4 million or 5 million drives. So we're looking, I think we mentioned at the end of March that we thought there were about 8 million drives out there, a mismatch between PCs sold through and drives sold in, I think we've added a couple of million units during the course of the last quarter. So you're probably looking there at a couple of weeks worth at the 20% level. I do think it's -- provided interest rates don't go crazy, and in the context of the current maturity of drive technologies relative to drive prices quarter-to-quarter and the system configurations and relative to the price points being hit in the market and the potential for significant price degradation quarter-to-quarter. I mean they are the things that influence the decision on air-ocean. And so I suspect it is here to stay for -- at least for a while. And the advantages, it tends to level the seasonality, which allows us to ship the full year on a lower capital investment, so that's positive for everybody in the chain from a cost and efficiency utilization perspective. The negative is that it reduces visibility and typically makes reaction to downside a more severe, short, sharp, shock thing. As Tim described our thinking on the upcoming quarter, we see July and August pretty much locked in because people are building pre-back-to-school on the assumption that it will be normal and that therefore, the holiday will be normal. Once we see in August what the back-to-school is shaping up like, then that will either continue to plan or they'll put the brakes on build, allow the ocean to flush through and then use air to catch up on any of these minor miscalculations, right? So we're a little cautious about September depending on the outcome of back-to-school.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC", "Okay, great answer. And just one last question on consumer electronics and branded. Obviously, everyone's been concerned about the low-end PC market, the Consumer segments, the notebook side. But your Branded and Consumer business actually hasn't been that bad. It hasn't fallen as much as, perhaps, the PC side. What would you attribute that to? Do think that the consumer market is buying these backup drives, for example, for existing PCs, and there's just a recognition that they should be backing up? Or are you able to gain share? Or -- there isn't a whole lot of visibility into that market, so any color you could provide would be helpful.", "John Coyne", "Well, our research into that market tells us that we still haven't effectively publicized or proselytized the backup story. There's still way, way too many people out there totally exposed in terms of backup. What we have seen is the deployment of what I call the personal cloud, where the continuing appetite for consumption of rich content, whether that be on PCs, on tablets, is leading to a significant level of sales for personal storage to expand the storage available in the home. And parallel to that, we're seeing expansion of storage in the cloud, which is driving the growth in the nontraditional enterprise space. And so, the growth of outside the PC storage is reflecting the huge growth in petabyte demand and the creation of content, which is you're driving that 40% year-over-year growth in petabytes of storage demand. And one place it shows up is in the external storage. Now if we can do an effective marketing job of convincing people that not only do they need that incremental storage, but they need to back it all up, then we have an even brighter future out there to go turn that opportunity into financial performance.", "Operator", "Mark Miller with Noble Financial.", "Mark Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc.", "I'm just looking at trying to compare, it looked like you had a similar ASP decline percentage-wise to your competitor, but it looks like your cost per drive unit was significantly better. Was there any product mix or any difference in sourcing of components externally, say, heads and media? Or could this difference be explained by your better management of the rare earth material issue?", "Wolfgang Nickl", "No, we had moderate price declines as we mentioned. I think you need take into consideration the increase in volume as well. We had good utilization of our assets, and we had decent cost declines. And as Tim mentioned, our channel and business segment mix was pretty much as expected.", "Mark Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc.", "So better operational performance. I've heard recently from some people in the industry that the transition to energy-assisted magnetic recording is kind of moving up. And I'm hearing things about maybe second half of next year. Can you give me kind of a feeling for that? Is that getting pulled in somewhat? Or is that still roughly 2 years out?", "John Coyne", "I think that's a difficult technology. We -- the industry is demonstrating the technology and has been for several years. But typically, in this kind of technology area, when you see the announcements of the new technology performing at the current level of the mature technology, you can add 3 years to volume availability of that new technology. And we have not yet reached the point of equivalence to the current technology in the lab demos that are demonstrating the new technology. So it's at least 3 years out for mass volume deployment.", "Mark Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc.", "Okay. And just my prior question. I understand, so there wasn't really any major change in the outsourcing of media or heads from previous quarters?", "John Coyne", "No.", "Operator", "Nehal Chokshi with Technology Insight.", "Nehal Chokshi", "Your near-line shipments were up about 8% q-over-q and year-over-year, whereas the industry near-line shipments were up 14% q-over-q and 28% year-over-year. So looks like market share here is declining. I was hoping you can provide some color as far as what's going on here and hopefully remedies that you have in the pipeline here.", "Timothy Leyden", "Actually, quarter-to-quarter, we did grow market share in the near-line enterprise. We continue to execute in that marketplace. We have -- we are shipping our near-line SAS, and we're on track with our product introductions. We are working on a few things in order to get a higher profitability on it. But overall, we're pretty pleased with where we are in that particular space.", "Nehal Chokshi", "Okay. Splitting to the segments, the DVR shipments, up very significantly. That does not seem to be market-driven. It seems to be market share-driven. Can you talk a little bit as far as what's going on there as well?", "Timothy Leyden", "Yes. With the product capabilities that we have and the -- some of the disruption that was in the marketplace during the course of the quarter, we were able to react to customer upside in that marketplace, and we're able to do so effectively. So consequently, it contributed to increased volume for us.", "Nehal Chokshi", "Does that also have anything to do with the proposed M&A activity in the -- going on? Or that's purely just upside customer demand for your specific products?", "Timothy Leyden", "Well, we wouldn't be able to separate out that from normal activity. So consequently, we believe it was due to our ability to be able to execute quicker than the competition.", "Nehal Chokshi", "Okay. My final question was that Seagate indicated that their CapEx will be at their low end of their model. So without the wafer fab conversion, where would you guys be at with respect to your CapEx in terms of the percent of revenue?", "Wolfgang Nickl", "Yes. In general, we tailor capital towards flexibility to respond to demand and to technology and be very reactive in realtime in reacting to capacity increases. We put the upper end out because we complete the wafer fab conversion. Without it, we would probably have been more in the middle of the range. But it's also important to point out that we're focusing strongly on linearity of capital spending. And what we actually will end up spending will largely depend on our view at the beginning of next calendar year, how the second half of next calendar year will look like.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Two questions. If I take the midpoint of your guidance in terms of the operating metrics, I get to around 20% gross margin. Wolfgang or John, can you kind of talk about what could be the swing factors that can maybe apply further upward pressure to gross margin as you navigate the September quarter? Is it really just about getting greater visibility on the back-to-school in the month of September or is it something else?", "Wolfgang Nickl", "Yes. I think you're right. First of all, the midpoint is 20.5%, so 18% to 23%. You'd usually expect in the second half of the calendar year to be in the upper end of that range. As we said, price declines are moderate, so it will depend to a large degree how well we can work internally and with our supplier partners to mitigate some of the cost challenges. And then Tim pointed out that back-to-school is important and the outlook of how the PC OEMs will look at the holiday season will trigger certain build and shipment mode decisions, which could have an impact on volume.", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. The second question is around the notebook market. John or Tim, can you talk about trying to reconcile your sequential growth in the June quarter versus your competitor, Seagate. It just seems like their 25.5% sequential growth is rather humongous. And does that present any challenges to the market going forward? Or was there just some sort of onetime event there that happened and that's kind of in their review mirror?", "John Coyne", "Well, I think our performance in 2.5-inch for last quarter was supply-constrained. We did call out in our April call that as a consequence of the earthquake, we were scrambling to underpin and by the end of April, had underpinned our planned 2.5-inch volumes and support of customers for the June quarter. We did execute to that plan and we did support all of the preplanned volumes there. But we had no upside in 2.5. In fact, we were somewhat constrained. We shipped more to support our OEM customers and we constrained ourselves in allocation to our Branded business, which is part of the reduction in our Branded business quarter-over-quarter. But that's not a constraint as we look forward.", "Operator", "Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Just a quick follow-up on gross margins first. Do you have a sense for where your gross margin would have been in September, if not for some of the higher component costs in rare earth issues? Would it -- is it 50 basis points or is it more than that?", "John Coyne", "I mean, it's hard to say that. I don't think -- I think the overall, if you take the baseline of the beginning of the year and look at the current cost of the rare earth materials and how much of them we used in shipping the average drive, I think the 200-basis point number that was used yesterday is pretty close. And then it's a matter of how much you can offset of that in usage, efficiency, utilization and how much then we're forced to share with our customer base and how timely we can make all of that understanding at action. And you can see the extent to which we've accomplished that in the last quarter. And the upcoming quarter guidance, I think, it's all implied in there.", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And you mentioned that the integration planning is on schedule. Does that mean that even with the deal closing a quarter later than you originally expected that you can hit those initial integration targets from a timing schedule? Or does everything get pushed by 3 months or so?", "John Coyne", "Well, everything is on a day 0 start schedules, so depending what the closing date is, there's then a process, which will -- initial process will be about 6 months to get the thing -- to get us integrated and most of the integration actions taken and then, it will take realistically another year after that to really get the full benefits of the new WD in terms of operational performance. And then over the next 5 years, you'll see the impact of our ability to increase effective investment in the fundamental technologies and product breadth that will allow us to further grow the business.", "Operator", "Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "John, could you talk a little bit about your views? You mentioned the TAM this quarter. What can the industry ship to? In other words, where would there be constraints that would come up? And do you sense that any of your competitors still have supply constraints?", "John Coyne", "There's-- I mean, we think the 170 million, 175 million can be supported. We think there may be some continuing constraints, primarily in the semiconductor side of the supply line. And it's a very deep, multi-layer supply chain and there's probably still some things from level 5 or level 6 working their way through the system that are not fully understood yet. So proceeding with caution and taking what we believe are all the appropriate actions to ensure that we have closed credibility around the supplier commits relative to our forecast and our build plans. I've got to say I was impressed by the overall industry capability demonstrated in last quarter because immediately post-earthquake, I was a lot more pessimistic about the industry's and our ability to hit our numbers last quarter. And we managed to do better than we anticipated. And it looks like many of our competitors also did the same. So it's a credit to the resilience of the supply chain and the inventiveness and dedication of all of the people involved.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "There's -- it looks like in your Q4, calendar Q4, you're embedding the market TAM to be relatively flat. Is there is somehow a conservatism in there? Or is that more of the ship issues that you're thinking about for TAM that looks to be relatively flat in Q4?", "John Coyne", "Yes. That's the impact, we think, of the ocean versus air. When you're using historical demand patterns to shape your build and logistics and you extend the logistics piece by several weeks, then the normal tail-off that would happen in December potentially now happens in November. And we run at a somewhat lower rate in the December quarter because the holidays stuff's all been shipped already.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I got it, okay. My last one then is, again, John, for you. Where did the clock start ticking, you think, on the rare earth? And what I mean by that is, prices started moving up a few months ago. And on one side you have the Chinese government, but on the other, you have presumably capitalism at work. When do you think you could potentially see non-Chinese sources for the acquired rare earth metals? Is it a year from now? Is it 6 months from now? Just any kind of metrics on when you might get some help on these issues from the supply side.", "John Coyne", "Well, bringing the mine back into production is a protracted process. And we do see some work going on in Australia that potentially could begin to impact the market next year. And I -- we're going to work on the other side of that one to try to reduce usage per drive as a way to address some of that. And the thing that's driving some of the quota behavior and so on in China is that there's an amped-up increased focus on environmental impact of these mining and refining activities, where the weaker, less capable players are being forced out of the market because they're unable to meet environmental requirements. And it's the more capable companies that are redoing their process to make sure they're in compliance with the environmental standards. And so I think, it'll get worked out, but it may take a while.", "So in closing, I'd just like to thank all of you for joining us today. We do appreciate your questions and your interest in the company and in the industry, and we look forward to seeing again next quarter. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Welcome to Western Digital's First Quarter Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2012. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.", "Bob Blair", "Thank you. To begin, I want to mention that we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning industry demand in the December quarter and the industry's ability to meet that demand. The impact for the flooding in Thailand on the industry and on our business on the December quarter and beyond, including our HDD capacity, our planned operations, recovery efforts and the costs and expenses incurred in connection with these efforts, and our ability to complete these recovery efforts. The expected completion and the timing of our planned acquisition of Hitachi GST, growth opportunities in the industry, our product offerings in the near-line enterprise market, OEM inventory levels and our financial results expectations for the December quarter, including revenue, gross margin, expenses, tax rate share count and loss per share.

We ask that analysts limit their comments to a single question and one follow-up question. ", "I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investors section of WD's website immediately following the conclusion of this call. I would now like to turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, John Coyne.", "John F. Coyne", "Thank you, Bob. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me are COO, Tim Leyden; and CFO, Wolfgang Nickl. As you can imagine, the WD team has been consumed recently in dealing with the relentless flooding in Thailand and its significant impact on our employees, their families and our suppliers, as well as on the business infrastructure in the region. We are grateful that the WD employees in Thailand are safe at this time, although many of their lives and homes have been disrupted and damaged. This is a disaster of unprecedented scale, with over 317 fatalities so far reported, over 9 million people affected, 700,000 homes and 14,000 factories flooded and over 660,000 workers out of work. The overall impact to the people of Thailand is immeasurable and our hearts go out to them in these trying times. ", "Having addressed the safety of our people and put in place programs to continue supporting them in this crisis, we have now turned our focus and energies to maximizing our capability to meet our customers' needs in the near term and to return our operations to normal as soon as possible. Full recovery will be a multi-quarter challenge. We believe the unconstrained HDD demand for the December quarter is flat to slightly down from September quarter ship levels. ", "Having said that, due to the concentration of HDD supply chain factories in various industrial parks in the flooded area, it is apparent that the HDD industry will be constrained in meeting that demand. Since WD has greater direct manufacturing exposure to the flooded areas, we believe the impact on our business in the short term will be greater than to other HDD manufacturers. In their remarks, Tim will provide a summary of how we're dealing with a operations challenges presented by the flooding and Wolfgang will provide a current quarter outlook. ", "Turning back to the September quarter, it materialized very much along the lines we expected. Industry shipments came in at 176 million units, just above the high-end of our estimate entering the quarter. This is a record quarterly shipment level for the hard drive industry, demonstrating the value of hard drives in the overall digital universe, even in an environment of broad-based, low growth and global economic uncertainty. ", "While the industry experienced a reasonable back-to-school season contributing to record quarterly shipments, the quarter-over-quarter growth was nevertheless muted by historical standards. We believe this is a reflection of the overall macro uncertainties, the slow growth being experienced in many mature markets and the PC industry's continued shift to a higher usage of sea freight instead of more expensive air freight, which has time shifted typical seasonal linearity. ", "WD's financial results and share growth demonstrate continued strong execution at a time when we have also been highly focused on our planned acquisition of HGST. We continue our work with the regulatory authorities around the world to obtain approval of our planned acquisition of HGST. Our integration planning activities are progressing well. Although we believe the acquisition should be cleared unconditionally, we have submitted a proposed confidential remedy to the European Commission to address issues raised in the course of its review. We now expect the European Commission to issue its decision on the transaction by November 30. We anticipate the other agencies reviewing our transaction will make their final determination within a similar timeframe. Therefore, we are maintaining our target for closing the HGST acquisition by the end of the calendar year. ", "Our analysis of the tremendous underlying long-term need for cost-effective mass storage in both developed and developing regions of the world underpins our continued enthusiasm for this business. We believe our model of providing high-quality product with speed, flexibility and low cost structure is a path to long-term success and shareholder value creation in this dynamic market. ", "While the flooding in Thailand presents us with a series of daunting challenges during the next several quarters, I'm highly confident in the abilities of the dedicated WD team with its strong execution skills to complete our operations recovery effectively and efficiency. This is a short-term challenge in what we continue to believe is a great long-term opportunity for continued profitable growth at WD. ", "Before turning the call over to Tim for his operations review, I want to pay tribute to the WD team for their heroic efforts in dealing with this adversity. A company leader could not ask for a greater effort and commitment than we have seen from this team. Tim?", "Timothy M. Leyden", "Thank you, John. Firstly, I would cover our fiscal Q1 performance and then give a status update on the impact of the Thailand flooding on our business. ", "WD shipped 57.8 million units in the September quarter, up 7.4% sequentially and 14% from the year-ago period. As we stayed focused on executing well in our core businesses, where our value proposition continues to resonate with our customer base. Higher volumes, favorable mix, pass through to customers of a portion of our rare earth material cost increases and minimal price declines delivered revenue growth of 12.1% quarter-on-quarter and 12.4% year-on-year. ", "Gross margins improved by 60 basis points to 20.1%. Price declines for the quarter were at a minimal level and were less than the seasonal norm. Product mix was favorable. Effective cost management and improved utilization enabled us to come in at the upper end of our implied gross margin guidance. Revenues totaled $2.7 billion, net income was $239 million and cash flow from operations declined sequentially from $447 million to $352 million, as we invested funds and working capital to establish a solid entry foundation for the December quarter. ", "Now turning to market segment performance. In the compute space, industry shipments increased to $119 million from $118 million in the June quarter and were up from $115 million in the year-ago quarter. WD shipped 41.2 million units into the compute space in the September quarter compared to 39.2 million units in the June quarter and 37.5 million units in the year-ago quarter. And we grew market share by approximately 30 basis points sequentially and 190 basis points year-on-year. Consumer activity was stronger, although this seasonal uplift was more muted than we have seen historically than is typical of fiscal Q1. ", "The near-line enterprise market was up sequentially from 6.4 million to 6.8 million units and up from 5.8 million units year-on-year. This market continues to benefit from the momentum of cloud computing. The traditional enterprise market at 7.9 million units was down from 8.3 million units in the June quarter, and was up year-on-year from 7.2 million units. WD shipped 2.4 million units into the combined enterprise markets in the September quarter, down from approximately 2.5 million in the June quarter and up from 2.3 million units in the year-ago quarter. ", "We remain on plan to bring our third-generation, 2.5-inch SAS product to market within the calendar year. HDD manufacturer shipments in the Branded Product segment came in at 14.4 million units, up from 12 million units in the June quarter and up from 11.6 million units in the year-ago quarter as a sequential demand increase followed typical seasonal patterns. Year-on-year unit growth in this segment was a strong at 24.1%. WD shipped 7.1 million units into this market in the September quarter, up from 5.7 million units in both the June and year-ago quarters. ", "WD's strong brand equity and broad product line enabled us to recover some of the market share position that we had lost due to supply constraints in the aftermath of the Japanese earthquake. In the DVR market segment, shipments were an estimated 14.1 million units, down sequentially from 14.4 million units in the June quarter and up from 13.2 million in the year-ago quarter. WD shipped 7.2 million units into this market in the September quarter, up from 6.5 million in the June quarter and up from 5.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Our performance in this segment reflects strong customer preference for WD's appealing product lineup.", "The remaining balance of the industry shipments is represented by gaming, automotive and 1.8-inch drives. Inventories in the HDD supply chain exiting the quarter were below historical run rate levels in each segment. Now turning to the December quarter. We believe that the unconstrained HDD demand TAM will be around 170 million units. We also believe that the industry will be supply-constrained due to the flooding in Thailand and the concentration of HDD suppliers and factories in various industrial states in the flooded and flood-threatened areas. ", "I'll now address the specific impact of the flooding on our business. We suspended production in all of our Thailand facilities from the beginning of last week in order to protect our personnel and to move as much equipment as possible to locations less likely to incur water damage. At this point, we are thankful that all our employees are safe. And we moved much of the equipment, which had been situated on the ground floors to higher floors. ", "Despite the heroic efforts of our team, over the past weekend, rising water, which had first penetrated the Bang Pa-in Industrial Park flood defenses, inundated the company's manufacturing facilities there and submerged the remaining equipment on the ground floors. At the other company manufacturing location in Thailand, Navanakorn Industrial Park, the park's flood defenses were breached on Monday morning, local time, and water began to flow into our buildings late on Tuesday night. ", "The flooded buildings in Thailand include our HDD assembly test and slider facilities, where a substantial majority of our slider fabrication capacity resides. In parallel with the intermittent slider shortages resulting from the above disruption, we're also experiencing other shortages on component paths from vendors located in several Thai industrial parks that have already been inundated by the floods or have been affected by protective plant shut downs. ", "We are evaluating the situation on a continuous basis. But in order to get these facilities back up and running, we need the water level to stabilize, after which point, it will take some period of time for the floods to recede. We're assessing our options so that we can safely begin working to accelerate the water removal and either extract and transfer the equipment to clean rooms in another locations or prepare it for operation on-site. ", "As a result of these activities, at this point in time, we estimate that our regular capacity and possibly our suppliers' capacity will be significantly constrained for several quarters. We are working with our suppliers to affect the recovery of their supply chain and to ramp existing capacity in other locations. We are proceeding with all possible haste and ingenuity to address the situation because we are mindful of the impact on our employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders and the communities in which we operate. We are also pursuing all possible options to maximize our Malaysian facility's throughput. ", "I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang Nickl for a review of our Q1 financial performance and our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2012.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Thank you, Tim. As a reminder, a summary of historical financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. In my remarks, I will first summarize our financial performance for last quarter and then I will provide a range of expected financial results for the December quarter. ", "For the September quarter, revenue was $2.7 billion, up 12% from the prior year ended June quarter. [indiscernible] average selling price was approximately $46 per unit, flat with the year-ago quarter and up $2 from the June quarter. Revenue from sales of our branded products was $489 million, up 15% from the year-ago quarter due to the continued strong customer preference for the WD brand. Branded products revenue was up 28% from the June quarter. There were no customer that comprised 10% or more of our total revenue. ", "Demand in Asia remains strong at 59% of revenue, up from 54% in the prior year and down slightly from 60% in the June quarter. Europe came in at 22% of revenue, down slightly from 23% in the prior year but up from the 20% reported in the June quarter. America with 19% of revenue, was down from both last year's 23% and June's 20%. ", "OEM sales represented 53% of revenue, up from 50% in the prior year. The OEM sales percentage was down slightly from June's 55%. Retail sales as a percent of revenue were 18%, flat to the prior year but seasonally up from June's 16%. Our gross margin for the quarter was 20.1%, up from 18.2% in the year-ago quarter and 19.5% in the June quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in gross margin is a function of an improved business segment and product mix. Overall, like-for-like costs increased slightly as higher costs of rare earth materials were not fully offset by savings in other areas. ", "As outlined during our last investor call, we implemented a series of offsetting measures, including significantly increasing our use of ocean shipments before passing along a portion of these cost increases to our customers. Ultimately, this contributed to relatively flat like-for-like pricing between the June and September quarter. ", "While we have achieved the gross margin level that was implied in our guidance, it is important to point out that we are still operating below the mid-point of our target business model. R&D and SG&A spending totaled $282 million from the September quarter as compared to $226 million and $297 million in the year-ago and June quarters, respectively. ", "The September quarter included $18 million for acquisition-related expenses and unrelated litigation accruals, whereas the June quarter included the combined $32 million for these items. Excluding these items, R&D and SG&A would have totaled $264 million or 9.8% of revenue in the September quarter versus $226 million or 9.4% of revenue in the year-ago quarter and $265 million or 11% of revenue in the June quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase is primarily a function of increased investments in product portfolio expansion and technology development. ", "Net interest and other non-operating expense was $1 million, including $3 million for commitment fees on the credit facility related to the pending acquisition of Hitachi's drive business. Excluding these fees, net interest and other non-operating income would have been $2 million. Net expense for the September quarter was $19 million or 7.4% of pretax income. This includes a $2 million favorable adjustment to tax accruals for settlement of IRS claims related to Komag, the magnetic media company we acquired in September of 2007. ", "Our net income for the September quarter totaled $239 million or $1.01 per share, as compared to $197 million or $0.84 per share for the year-ago quarter and $158 million or $0.67 per share in the June quarter. September quarter included $21 million for acquisition-related operating expenses and bank commitment fees and unrelated litigation accruals, whereas the June quarter included a combined $35 million for these items. Excluding these items, non-GAAP net income for the September quarter totaled $260 million or $1.10 per share as compared to $197 million or $0.84 per share in the year-ago quarter and $193 million or $0.81 per share in the June quarter. ", "Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash conversion cycle for the September quarter was 1 day. This consisted of 46 days of receivables, 27 days of inventory, or 13 terms, and 72 days of payables. We generated a $352 million in cash from operations during the September quarter and our free cash flow totaled $218 million, reflecting strong sales linearity and tight asset management. We made a conscious decision to increase ocean shipments as an offset to the cost increase as we're experiencing for rare earth materials. This is reflected an increase of our finished goods inventory by $58 million. ", "Capital expenditure for the September quarter totaled $134 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter totaled $158 million. We made a $31 million debt repayment during the September quarter and thereby, reduced our debt balance to $263 million. We exited fiscal Q1 with cash and cash equivalents of $3.7 billion, an increase of $185 million from the June quarter. Approximately, $3 billion of our ending cash balance was offshore. ", "Let me now provide some context for our guidance for the December quarter. From a market perspective, we believe that starting inventory in the distribution retail channels was very lean and we believe there were no further increases of the inventory levels that our OEM customers hold. We estimate that approximately 40% of all drives in the industry are produced in Thailand, with Western Digital being overweight [ph] at approximately 60%. ", "With respect to our specific situation, there are a number of significant factors that are impacting our guidance and that will influence our financial performance in the December quarter. We've shut down our Thailand factories and are at this point, not in a position to establish when they will recommence operations. Furthermore, some of our key suppliers have ceased production as well and are significantly impacted. We are working diligently with them but at this point in time, we do not yet fully understand the timeline for their full recovery. Both of these conditions will likely continue into the March quarter and possibly beyond. Costs will be impacted negatively by the significant under-absorption of our assets and infrastructure. We also expect to incur additional costs in restoring supply. We will also forego land-ocean savings in favor of airfreight in order to increase immediate availability for our customers. ", "On the OpEx aside, we will continue to invest in growth areas such as our enterprise, SSD and branded product businesses. We will continue to see acquisition-related expenditures during the quarter. We expect to incur unusual charges and expenses related to the impact of the flooding on our operations, including items such as fixed asset impairments, inventory write-downs, charges related to cancellation of purchase order for excess materials, further charges for reclaim and recovery work and foreign currency losses to settle forward exchange contracts that exceed our current requirements. ", "With this in mind, our guidance for the December quarter is as follows: This guidance does not include acquisition-related expenses and the unusual charges and expenses that I just referred to. Further, this guidance reflects our current assessment of the Thailand situation. And as we have said, that situation and our understanding of its impact on our business continues to evolve. ", "We expect hard drive shipments of between 22 million and 26 million units. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.25 billion. R&D and SG&A spending will be approximately $230 million, excluding acquisition-related expenses and unusual charges. We expect tax expense of approximately $10 million. We anticipate our share count to be approximately $234 million. Accordingly, we estimate a non-GAAP loss per share of between $1.10 and $1.50 for the December quarter, which excludes acquisition-related expenses and the unusual charges and expenses related to the flooding in Thailand. ", "Operator, we're now ready to open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "In terms of understanding what's going on in Thailand, do you have any sense of the impact to the total supply chain? And by asking that, I mean, what do you expect the industry's ability to shift products to be in the December quarter?", "Timothy M. Leyden", "Sherri, this is Tim. As we pointed out in the scripts, it is a very live situation. We are looking at mechanical components of the ones that seem to be the most impacted at this stage when we look at the external components. In our own case, we're impacted internally through the slider fab because the vast majority of our product, of our internal sliders are made in Bang Pa-in at the ground floor, which is now inundated with water. We also process small percentage of WD wafers through a slider fab in the Philippines, which we will be ramping up. And in addition, you'll recall that our long-term model for our finished heads is to purchase 10% to 20% from the merchant market. So what we see is, in our case, the slider fab is the limiting situation. And we see mechanical components and motors significantly impacted. But we are not in a position to be able to provide insight into how that impacts the rest of the industry and it would be merely speculative on our part at this stage.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, that's fair. And then just thinking about your facility in Malaysia, how much extra capacity do you have in Malaysia that you could utilize? And do you have plans to buy equipment to go into Malaysia or to move equipment there?", "Timothy M. Leyden", "We're looking at every possible option in order to improve our capacity. But right now, we're more constrained by material and component availability. But there is plans underway to be able to react and to increase our production in the Malaysian factory and indeed, to extract the equipment from the buildings that are currently inundated and put them in other clean room locations. All of that is -- the planning for that is underway. But as you can imagine, with the infrastructure and the logistical problems that are there, it is not an easy task because the water is still surrounding our facilities. So we'll have to figure out a way to extract the water and/or figure out a way that we can use the water in order to extract equipment. And as well as that we are looking at new -- at purchasing equipment, et cetera in order to make sure that we can react to our customer needs because this is a significant issue for all the constituents involved, the customers, employees, ourselves, the community and shareholders, we understand the seriousness of this.", "Operator", "Rich Kugele with Needham and Co.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "I know it's a dynamic situation but in terms of the equipment itself, what happens when water touches it? I mean, is it even recoverable? And are all those suppliers still in existence or what actually has to happen from an equipment standpoint if they're not. And then I have a quick follow-up.", "John F. Coyne", "Well, there are people that were able to engage in order to provide an evaluation of similar situations, which we are pursuing. And we did remove, in many cases, we removed the electronics from the heavier equipment and got it up to higher ground. But there's a -- it really is going to depend on an assessment once we get in, have a look and see what sort of impact from the water. And perhaps any other -- monitor whatever else is in there. And we're looking at obviously the equipment manufacturers and the people who would be able to provide equipment. We're looking in the used market and so we're looking at every possible option.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just lastly, from an insurance standpoint, can you talk about to what degree you are insured against these losses? Is there just equipment inventory or is it also some level of business continuity insurance? Was it insured despite being related to hit around flood plains and such?", "John F. Coyne", "Yes, we carry flood insurance for both our equipment and inventory and we also have business interruption insurance.", "Operator", "Scott Craig [ph] with BMI-Mellon [ph].", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Tim, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but when you talk about multi-quarters and you kind of looked at what, say ON [ph] Semiconductors said this morning, it sort of looks like this going to take a year for yourselves and the industry to recover. Is that sort of the right timeframe even if you are capable of setting up shop elsewhere or transferring equipment and stuff like that? And then secondly, around the Malaysia facilities, can you provide a little bit more details as to what sort of capacity utilization that facility was running at and how quickly you can transfer stuff over to that facility recognizing that there is some components constraint issues as well?", "Timothy M. Leyden", "Yes, I can't speculate on the length of the period. I mean, the WD team has effectively in times past been able to take facilities from just a shell and bring it up and get it up to high volume in a relatively short period of time, certainly within -- well within the period that you mention. Then as far as the Malaysia is concerned, it is, as you can well imagine also, there does has to be some reconfiguration. We have to make sure that we can run all the different array of products in there, so there has to be some reconfiguration. But again, that is something we have done before, something that the team is very skilled at and we've got a very dedicated team. And they're looking at every possible option in order to get the plant up and running. But as I say, right know, our biggest constraint is components.", "Operator", "Ben Reitzes with Barclays.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Can we talk about inventory a little bit, John? I'm a little confused. I guess, there's OEM inventory. There's distributor inventory and then there's your inventory, which you have finished goods that you said was a lot of rare earths. Can you just kind of talk about what kind of buffer, if there is any, in the industries out there from a distributor and OEM level? How many weeks can the industry and yourselves operate and based on what you see out there. And then I have a follow-up.", "John F. Coyne", "Sure. We think the distribution inventory exiting last quarter was in the 4-week range. We believe that the OEM jet hub inventories will be at about the 2-week range. And then our own inventories, the majority of which was on boats at quarter end, I think probably about 1 week. Our competitors, as you know, tend to run a little heavier on inventory than we do. So from an -- I would think that the distribution comment, industry level and WD levels, are equivalent. I think in the OEM jet situation, you're probably around that same number with a larger number of weeks in enterprise inventory. And then I think internal company inventories you could readily see from a review of their financials.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then, can you talk about the cash impact you're looking at? I assume I don't think, Wolfgang, you mentioned the CapEx, and it maybe hard to say. But it looks like you got to spend money on equipment on this. And we're just wondering is the cash flow impact more than the loss? And to what degree? And then the follow-up to that is then you have insurance, so I assume there's some cash recovery. So, I guess, your best guess on cash, the puts and takes, and what we should deduct.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, I can give you some guidance there. Obviously, you start at the last levels that were specified. Depreciation runs at about $160 million that you add back. For the capital that we've already received and that we are obligated to pay and that we'll pay, you can assume roughly $150 million. That does not include replacement capital. As Tim said, it's simply impossible for us to estimate that at the current point in time. As you know, we have about $31 million of scheduled debt repayments every quarter. And we do expect some impact on the working capital, in particular, as we support some of the suppliers that are hit very, very hard by this. If you assume $100 million impact just as a working assumption, you would see that our cash impact, based on the guidance we have given, is anywhere between $375 million and $475 million. And again, that excludes the one-time expenditures that we will incur for incremental services, replacement equipment, et cetera.", "Operator", "Mark Moskowitz with JPMC.", "Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "John, a hypothetical for you. If WD had all of your facilities, let's say, in Singapore and Malaysia, what would be the relative decline sequentially in units due to components because of the Thailand flooding. I'm just trying to get a sense of what the ramifications are for not just WD but for the broader industry. Would you still guide to 22 million to 26 million units or would it be a little higher?", "John F. Coyne", "I think, Mark, Tim indicated that the immediate constraint for us as we enter November here is the slider fab capacity that is currently offline. And we're making concerted efforts to take that away from being -- become the first constrained item. Next set of items are components. And as Tim said, I think it's too early. We are beginning to develop a reasonable understanding of how that component availability and the actions in train in our supply base affect WD. It's still ongoing in terms of -- many supplier facilities are shut down in order to assure the safety of their employees and to allow time to try to protect equipment and so on. But those facilities may or may not be subsequently inundated and the surrounding roads and access may or may not be passable in the near future. So it's a very developing situation that we're watching. Right now, there's a significant degree of uncertainty as you saw in Wolfgang's numbers around our estimates as to what we can accomplish. And frankly, we're much more concerned about that and our ability to support our customers and to restore our business than we are in looking at what's going on in the rest of the industry.", "Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Maybe you could focus on the fundamentals from the prior quarter, December quarter. Could you just weigh in, if you could, in terms of the desktop, trend line. Desktop seems to be a little different than usual in terms of the sequential movement. Was that related to more and more ocean shipments in the prior quarter, or back-to-school and holiday season? Or what was going on there?", "John F. Coyne", "I don't think there was anything out of line with expectations. I mean, we saw flattish desktop and a little bit of growth in notebook. But pretty much in line with expectations right across the mix of products and markets and I think we had said 170 to 175, we came in at 176 for the market. And I don't think there was anything significant in kind of pattern changes within that market. Maybe one little thing, Europe was maybe a tad stronger than we expected and the U.S. was maybe a tad weaker than we expected.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jayson Noland with Baird.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Is it fair to assume that March quarter constraints could be more severe than the December quarter, just given your entering this quarter with an inventory buffer?", "John F. Coyne", "Yes, I think the inventory buffer is right through the pipeline, so you would have to estimate that, that would be the case. Because people, in our case, some of our inventory obviously is compromised because of the flooding. In others, they probably have more inventory and the pipeline can use it. And the same thing from the suppliers, had inventory in the pipeline that is currently getting used. So you would have to surmise that the -- that it would be more difficult in the next quarter than in the current quarter. Plus, I think people in this quarter tend to bring a little bit heavier inventory of finished goods because it's front-end loaded. And so consequently, there's probably a little bit of tailwind from that too that might be there from other quarters. So yes, I believe so.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. Tim, that makes sense. And last question from me. Is there anything you can say at this point on the timing of what the integration with HGST would look like and how much exposure does HGST have to Thailand?", "John F. Coyne", "I mean the timing, we're eagerly awaiting for the time-out of the EU process, 30th of November. We're working very hard with all the other regulatory authorities to try to bring them to a conclusion around about the same time. And we will, as soon as we have regulatory clearance, be looking to consummate the transaction as soon as possible. In terms of Hitachi's footprint in Thailand, we believe that their 2 facilities, significant I think probably a little less to Thailand's output relative to total output than WD. And those facilities are outside of the current flood area. As to their supply lines and so on, we have no information.", "Operator", "Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I wondered if you could just speak to what you think happens to pricing if the TAM is called 170 million units but components -- there are some components that are 60% out of Thailand, I mean there's going to be a material gap in the availability of drives. What happens to pricing you think in the December and March quarters with what looks like to be very severe shortages of drives?", "John F. Coyne", "Again, we're going to have to look at the basics behind what drives it, what drives pricing. And obviously, supply is a significant factor. But as well as that, there will be extraordinary efforts carried out by everybody in order to try and see if they can get as much volume into the supply chain as possible. And that will require expediting charges, it will require logistical charges and it will require a significant amount of extra effort, probably extra overtime working and just to mention a few. So that will have to be recovered in the pricing by the people that are doing those extraordinary efforts. And we will have to give some simply monies to the suppliers in order to be able to do that also. So it will be -- I think there'll be upward pressure on pricing right through the supply chain.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Let me ask a follow-up then, if I could. If you took the choice of buying new equipment and trying to integrate equipment and drive facilities, what's that process timeline?", "John F. Coyne", "So it depends on the type of equipment. And if it's a test equipment for instance. And in our case, if you look at what has been submerged, the fiber fab equipment has been submerged. Obviously, we've had some test equipment submerged although we have electronics removed from that. And some HGA [ph] equipment, although that's a relatively small percentage of our total volume. So in the case of test equipment probably can be done. If you are to replace it with new equipment, probably can be done in the 3 to 5 month region. Assembly equipment can probably be done -- again, making assumptions that the people that make this equipment are not dependent on the componentry [ph]    and  selection [ph]  around the affected areas. And then if it has anything to do with wafer- and fab-type equipment, it's obviously a longer lead time. Probably, you're talking about somewhere in the 9- to 12-month region in that particular case.", "Operator", "Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.", "Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "How should we think about how this potential impacts your future product transitions and the roadmap for 2012? Or at least how should we think about this? And I recognize that this is an unprecedented and very unfortunate situation to try to make these types of predictions.", "John F. Coyne", "I think that's an area we're also very focused on. I think Wolfgang's OpEx guidance gives you some hint as to how we're thinking about that, we're viewing this entirely differently from the 2008 economic collapse, where we were looking at a projected fall-off in demand and sizing our business appropriately. We're looking at this as a short-term interruption of our ability to manufacture. The demand side of our equation continues to be highly robust and our challenge is how to address that as quickly as possible and as effectively as possible. So we're committed to ensuring that when we get back into full production, we're producing up-to-the-minute products that are responsive to customer need at that time. So we're continuing our investment in engineering, we're fairly focused on expanding activity here in the short term in our U.S. prototype manufacturing facilities and we will be carving out a piece of the Malaysia manufacturing capacity, which is currently dedicated to future products and product development. And that will be maintained focused on future product development.", "Operator", "Kevin Hunt with Auriga.", "Kevin M. Hunt - Auriga USA LLC, Research Division", "I just have a follow-up question on the Hitachi transaction. Will there be any reason why this would affect -- the issue in Thailand will affect that? And how -- maybe you can help us understand how that might impact your integration of the Hitachi, assuming it will have some impact?", "John F. Coyne", "I think the flexibility that a post-combination environment gives us relative to mixing and matching of available parts, of all available production tooling, et cetera, getting this deal done quickly is very beneficial to the overall return of the industry supply and, therefore, very beneficial to customers. So all of the things that we said about the deal and why it was good for our customers, good for us, good for our employees, good for our suppliers, all of those things hold true and have been amped up by the current situation. So we're very eager to get to grips with this and immediately move into a consummated deal that can get regulatory approval.", "Operator", "Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "I guess, to that end as well, John, is that sort of another way of saying that, this could actually help push the deal through -- kind of push it through faster maybe than, you know, 4 weeks ago?", "John F. Coyne", "Well, I would certainly hope so. And that I believe the regulators would view their role as being to protect the consumer. And I see no better way to protect the consumer than making high-quality product highly available. And so I would hope they would adopt that view. We will certainly be pushing in that direction. And if we continue to work with them to propose what we believe are clear benefits of the deal.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "And then to that end, recognizing that there's not great visibility into the [indiscernible] circumstances, to what extent, if any, might the situation in Thailand impact -- I guess, what you and Hitachi had envisioned sort of together in terms of production, integration, sharing, things of that nature as being an important part of the, I guess, of the accretive benefit of the deal?", "John F. Coyne", "I don't think there's any. I mean, the deal -- we did the deal as a long-term deal and we believe that current situation is a -- I don't want to downplay it. It's very serious situation, but it is short term in nature and we will recover from it. And we view the benefits of the deal as long term but the quicker we get the deal done, the faster we're going to access those benefits and pass them on to our customer base.", "Operator", "Joe Yoo with Citi.", "Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I actually want to go back to the inventory levels at the OEM jet hubs. You talked about 2 weeks. But my sense is that during the end of the quarter, generally, that inventory level goes down seasonally because OEMs pull more inventory than usual. Is that a correct assessment?", "John F. Coyne", "It's probably correct that some of the OEMs tend to skinny out inventory a bit at the end of their quarter. But most of the OEM volume that we support has different quarter ends than us. They're offset by a month, so the major -- a number of the major OEMs are -- this month are in their run end to the end of their quarter.", "Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Got it. My second question's for Wolfgang. If you look at the revenue and the unit guidance, am I correct in calculating that ASPs will actually go down meaningfully sequentially? So I wanted to reconcile your comments on pricing potentially being favorable with your ASP's sequential decline.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "No, I think you need to review the math. In the revenue guidance, there's a small portion of products that are not price-dependent in there as well but implied in our guidance is marginally increased pricing.", "Operator", "Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I guess, I want to ask kind of beyond just the equipment restart time, what is the process as far as you guys having roughly 50% of your revenue coming from 10-key customers. What's the process of qualification or the cycle for that matter as you turn facilities back on? Because I think some of the OEMs qualify not only just the drive but the actual manufacturing facility, the equipment and even the upstream suppliers. So how does that factor into the time to recover, I guess, is the question?", "John F. Coyne", "I think the -- typically, yes, we have an internal qualification process that as we bring up any new facility or any new piece of equipment, there's a prescribed process that we go through to validate it. And I'm very confident given the discussions I've had with all of our major customers over the past several days as this situation has emerged, that with the strong support we're receiving from all of our customers that we will work out a parallel process where our bring-up qualifications are done in parallel with the customers' requirements so that, as we're ready to press the go button, everybody will be satisfied that, that is a controlled, high-quality, ready-for-mass volume situation and we won't lose any time by overlapping -- by doing those qualifications sequentially.", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And then as a follow up, just looking at the guidance again, looking at the numbers, it's pretty clear that you're assuming no, if not a negative gross margin. So I guess the question on that was, I think, historically, Western Digital's very been effective in leveraging a variable cost structure. Can you help us understand how much of your COGS line is kind of variable in nature relative to fixed and kind of gauge that overhead that basically lack of utilization presents on the gross margin line?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, I'll give you a couple of pointers. First of all, you're right, the guidance actually implies negative gross margin. We're dealing with a substantial portion of what we will call fixed cost.  You know, what the depreciation is but there's a very significant factor, the infrastructure, that will stay there since it's a small, short-term issue to deal with. Then we're also dealing with certain costs that you would ordinarily describe as variable but they're already sticky because we're paying our workforce in Thailand, for instance. And then you're dealing with cost related to your input materials. Those are from a mix between internal and external components and then a general, I think you mentioned it, expediting of input materials and that's all affected in the mass. But you're right, it's a negative gross margin.", "Operator", "Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I understand there's really no historical precedence for this, but how do you in the industry decide over the next couple of quarters how to allocate the much smaller number of units across the various channels, OEMs distribution and retail. Because it seems like OEMs could gobble up everything that's available and still be supply-constrained. And so is this strategy to give everything you can to OEMs? Or do you feel like you need to fairly balance the units available across all of the channels?", "John F. Coyne", "In looking at satisfying our customer base, we will focus on being fair and equitable to all branches of our business. The business that's prosecuted directly under the Western Digital brand, as well as that of our OEMs and that of our distribution partners. And to that end, we stopped shipments last weekend in order that we could get our arms around where everything is and ensure that as we began shipping again, that product was allocated appropriately to the long-term established business partnerships in our customer base.", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I think you said the vast majority of your slider production is in Thailand. Is that to the tune of 90%? Is it that high? And are there third parties that you could work with that could supply you that component?", "John F. Coyne", "It's not that high. But it is a majority, the substantial majority of our production. And yes, we are working with partners, have been working with partners for some time to rapidly ramp our partnership accessible capacity. And also, we're working to execute plans to bring some of our own capacity back up in short order.", "John F. Coyne", "Well, thank you all very much for tuning in to the call today. As you can imagine, we'll be highly focused in the weeks and months ahead to ensure the continued well-being of our employees and to complete our business recovery from this significant but temporary setback.

Please go ahead, sir.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Jaimie, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining us on the call today are Sanjay Mehrotra, President and CEO of SanDisk; and Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President of Administration and CFO.

SanDisk assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements that speak as of their respective dates. ", "With that, I will turn the call over to Sanjay.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Thank you, Jay. Good afternoon, everyone. I will focus most of my remarks today on describing the key developments we are seeing in the industry and factors in our business that are causing our results to be less than we had anticipated, as well as how we are addressing these developments. We now believe the industry experienced an imbalance between supply and demand in the first quarter, and we believe this imbalance is likely to continue through the second quarter of 2012. Industry demand has been weaker than we had expected, and we believe supplies have increased more than we had estimated at the beginning of the year. This led to greater-than-expected price decline, particularly in the second half of the first quarter, impacting our revenue and gross margin. As we look into the second half of the year, we believe the ramp of new smartphones, tablets, ultrabooks and Enterprise solid state drives, along with stronger seasonality, should lead to an improved demand environment. With this demand, coupled with a modest wafer capacity growth expected within the industry for the remainder of the year, we expect a better supply-demand environment in the second half of 2012. ", "For SanDisk, our first quarter results were impacted by 2 key factors: greater-than-expected price decline; and slower-than-expected demand for mobile cards from certain OEM customers with whom we have high shares. If you recall, steeper industry price declines for certain products began to be reported in the late part of the fourth quarter of 2011, indicating the existence of some excess supply, which continued in the seasonally weak quarter. We had expected pricing trends to moderate later in the first quarter, but instead, the rate of price decline accelerated even more. Despite the weaker demand for OEM mobile cards, the diversity of our customer base enabled us to allocate more products towards the demand from our white label customers. As such, we met our first quarter petabyte and unit sales objective. However, the different mix of sales than we had originally planned contributed to our weak first quarter results. ", "I would like to comment on aspects of card demand as we have observed at some of our mobile OEM customers. As a part of offerings and the competitive environment for mobile phones continues to evolve at a rapid pace, some handset OEMs recently began to adjust their bill of materials, resulting in the lower rate of OEM card bundling, as well as a reduction in bundled card capacity. It is too soon to determine whether this is temporary or a longer-term trend, and we are monitoring it carefully. While we are maintaining our market share of bundled mobile OEM cards, we believe that the overall industry demand for OEM bundled cards has been somewhat below previous expectations and has contributed to the supply-demand imbalance in the first half of this year. However, we also believe that lower card bundling rates for slotted phones could translate into expanded opportunities for the retail channel at potentially higher unit capacities. ", "I will now comment on the second quarter. We expect the first quarter trends of industry supply-demand imbalance and weaker OEM card demand to continue in the second quarter as well. Further, we plan to reduce sales to the white label channels. An additional factor that is expected to impact our growth opportunity in the second quarter is our embedded business. Over the course of the last 2 to 3 years, this business has grown nicely for us, and our approach to drive it through our diversified customer base has worked well. We are a supplier to all the major mobile phone and tablet manufacturers. However, the mobile industry market share is becoming increasingly concentrated, and to fully address the mobile market opportunities now requires a more diversified portfolio of embedded offerings, which include not only iNANDs but also new embedded solutions, such as customer-specific multichip package and other unique and proprietary embedded products. We have been somewhat late in adapting our product roadmap to the broad set of requirements of the leading OEM customers, and this limits our embedded growth opportunity in the second quarter. ", "We are already in the process of developing and qualifying our new embedded products, including our next-generation, high-performance iNANDs for the leading mobile OEMs. We believe these new products will also expand our embedded market opportunity to a broader range of handsets, tablets and other devices for both the established and emerging markets compared to what we are able to address in the first half of this year. In fact, we have just completed qualification of our MCP embedded solution with a leading OEM and are in qualification at several other customers. With continued successful completion of product development and customer qualifications, we expect our new iNANDs, MCP and other embedded offerings to begin ramping production starting in the second half of 2012, enabling us to gain embedded share with leading mobile OEMs later this year. ", "In our other businesses, SSD sales posted solid sequential growth. In the Client segment, we launched our SanDisk Extreme Client SSD for both the retail and e-tail channels, and this has received excellent third-party reviews that show its industry-leading performance. Product revenue in these channels is gaining momentum, and we expect to launch additional products in the second quarter. For OEM customers, we successfully launched the X100 high-performance Client SSD and we have achieved stellar design wins already with many of these expected to begin high-volume production in the second quarter. Additional customer qualifications are in progress. Our partnership is conducive, formerly Diskeeper, enables us to offer a uniquely optimized software and SSD solution for SSD cache application, and this further strengthens our competitive position in this segment. Our embedded SSD offering, the SanDisk iSSD, has secured several new design wins in ultrabooks. Overall, for both standalone and caching SSD applications, ultrabooks are gaining momentum and increasing SSD attachments in mobile computing devices. ", "For the enterprise markets, we have begun qualification of our latest generation of 6-gigabit SAS SSDs at key OEMs. Our PCIe products are on track to begin shipments in the second quarter. Customer engagements continue to gain traction for our enterprise set of solutions. With the recent acquisition of FlashSoft, we added another dimension to our Enterprise solutions, and the initial customer response to our expanding portfolio has been positive. Our strategy to enable FlashSoft solutions to support a broad array of products, including competitive SSD and PCIe products, is important to our target customers. We believe the expanding portfolio and breadth of solutions with our SAS, PCIe, SATA, SSDs and software for our enterprise customers positions us well for continued SSD revenue growth in 2012 and beyond.", "To conclude my comments on the SSD business, growth in our Client and Enterprise SSD revenues remains on track to account for more than a 10% mix of our total revenue for the year. In retail, our market share in the developed regions such as U.S., Europe and Japan remain strong. Units sold in the emerging markets more than doubled from last year, and these markets now account for approximately half of our total retail unit volume.  Products sold to emerging markets tend to be at lower average capacities compared to products sold in the developed markets, but our average capacity for the total retail business grew on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. ", "From a manufacturing technology perspective, our 19 nanometer technology is ramping well, with use on both the X2 and X3 memory architectures ahead of expectations at this stage of the transition. ", "Turning to fab supply, based on the positive 19 nanometer yield trends and our latest estimates of demand assessment and supply requirements, we have decided to maintain the pause of Fab 5 capacity ramp through at least the end of 2012. ", "In summary, we are disappointed with our first quarter results and our near-term prospects, which we believe will lead to a sequential decline in revenue in the second quarter. We believe our business results for the first half of the year will reflect a temporary setback to our long-term vision and objectives, and we fully expect to reemerge stronger in the second half of this year. We remain highly focused on diversifying and strengthening the mix of our business portfolio. Our SSD business remains on a solid revenue ramp. Our retail business continues to see strong demand growth from emerging markets and we are gaining shares in most regions. Our cost leadership in the industry remains firm. In the second half, with a better supply-demand environment and successful execution with our next-generation embedded products, we expect to deliver strong quarterly sequential revenue growth. We are very confident about the long-term prospects for SanDisk in light of the secular growth drivers for our business from smartphones, tablets, ultrabooks and, in particular, Client and Enterprise SSDs. ", "With that, I will turn the call over to Judy for her financial overview and outlook.", "Judy Bruner", "Thank you, Sanjay. I'll cover the key aspects of our Q1 results and then turn to our future expectations. Starting with revenue, our first quarter product revenue was 65% OEM and 35% retail. Retail revenue was down 30% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year, and OEM revenue was down 22% sequentially and down 10% year-over-year. Both our retail and OEM businesses were impacted by a sequential decline in petabyte demand and a steep price decline. In total, our petabytes sold declined 4% sequentially and grew 65% year-over-year. And our ASP per gigabyte declined 22% sequentially and 45% year-over-year. ", "We had expected this sequential decline in petabytes sold, but as Sanjay described, the industry price decline was steeper than we had expected, particularly in the second half of the quarter. Within our retail business, we believe this sequential decline in petabytes sold reflected normal seasonality. In fact, it was less of a decline than we experienced in Q1 last year. Our retail petabytes sales grew sequentially in emerging markets, and we believe, overall, we gained retail card and USB share in emerging markets and in the U.S. ", "Our global retail unit sales were in line with our expectations, but the price decline was greater than we had estimated. Within the OEM channel, unit sales of mobile cards grew sequentially, but the unit demand was less than we had expected from certain mobile OEMs. And as we shifted our card mix more toward white label customers, this further increased the decline in our average selling price. Our Q1 mobile embedded product sales were down sequentially in units and dollars, but were in line with the forecast we had provided in January, which already reflected weakness from certain mobile OEMs as well as seasonality. Our SSD revenue, the majority of which is sold through the OEM channel, had strong sequential and year-over-year growth, and we are pleased with the progress we are making in the SSD markets. Our license and royalty revenue was up 18% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially due primarily to a favorable adjustment in Q4, which I commented on last quarter. ", "In summary, the miss in our Q1 revenue from our January forecast came predominantly from a higher rate of price decline than we had anticipated and from lower-than-expected card demand from certain mobile OEM customers. Our total non-GAAP gross margin was 36%, below our forecasted range of 39% to 42%. Our total cost per gigabyte improved 11% sequentially and 36% year-over-year, which was in line with our expectations even after taking approximately $24 million of unexpected lower of cost or market inventory reserves, resulting from the high price decline. ", "Non-captive memory represented approximately 8% of our Q1 revenue compared to approximately 11% in Q4. And the yen rate in our cost of sales was in line with our forecast at approximately 78, representing purchases that were locked in primarily during the fourth quarter of 2011. ", "The gap between our 22% price decline and the 11% cost decline drove the sequential decline in our total non-GAAP gross margin from 43% in the fourth quarter to 36% in the first quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $205 million were down sequentially by $22 million, due primarily to reduced expense for incentive compensation tied to our financial results and a onetime insurance recovery of certain past legal expenses. Operating margin for the first quarter was 19% on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP other income and expense was an expense of $3 million, which included a nonrecurring charge recorded at the joint ventures. Without this unexpected item, other income would have been similar to our previous forecast of approximately $5 million per quarter. ", "On the balance sheet, cash and short and long-term marketable securities decreased by $143 million and ended the quarter at $5.5 billion on a gross basis and $3.5 billion net of debt at the maturity value. Cash flow from operations in Q1 was $67 million. Our primary cash outflows included $144 million for CapEx, $55 million for the FlashSoft acquisition and $61 million for share repurchases. We had net zero capital investment in the joint ventures during Q1. We provided new joint venture equipment lease guarantees of $156 million, and our total off-balance sheet equipment lease guarantees stood at $737 million at the end of Q1. Inventory growth was in line with our expectations as we sold approximately the same number of petabytes as we had originally expected. ", "I'll now turn to forward-looking commentary. Our revenue expectations for 2012 have come down considerably due to the 3 key factors we have discussed today. First, while we expect the pricing environment to improve from Q1, particularly in the second half of the year, we expect the steeper price decline in the first half of 2012 to result in considerably lower price levels for the whole year, reflecting a weaker industry supply-demand balance than we had previously anticipated. ", "Second, market share among the mobile handset providers is consolidating, and we have been adapting our embedded product roadmaps to better address the evolving requirements of the leading mobile OEMs. We expect to complete product development and qualification of many new embedded solutions in Q2, with revenue benefiting the second half of 2012. ", "And the third factor is that we forecast mobile OEM card demand for the year to be less than our original expectations. We believe these factors, combined with reduced reliance on the white label channels, will result in a sequential decline in our Q2 revenue, with total Q2 revenue forecasted to be approximately $1 billion, plus or minus $50 million. We expect to deliver strong sequential revenue growth in both the third and fourth quarters, driven by sales of new embedded products and accelerating growth in our SSD sales combined with our expectation of an improved pricing environment. However, we expect the full year 2012 revenue will be down from our 2011 results. ", "Turning to gross margins, I'll provide some color on our assumptions as to cost and pricing. For the full year 2012, our anticipated cost improvement is in the upper half of the 25% to 35% range that we have previously shared. There are 4 key factors impacting our cost assumptions, all of which are included in our expected 2012 cost improvement. First, our 19 nanometer transition and yields are on track or ahead of original estimates. Remember that the 19 nanometer transition generates less cost reduction than did the 24 nanometer transition, and this will result in less cost reduction in Q2 cost of sales than we achieved in Q1, which still benefited from the 24 nanometer transition. Second, our expected usage of non-captive memory has come down from our original estimates for 2012, which has a positive impact. Third, our yen-based wafer purchases are approximately 70% hedged for 2012 at an average rate of approximately 78. While the yen has weakened somewhat, assuming it stays at its current level, our average yen rate in cost of sales for the remainder of the year will be approximately 79, which would result in a slight sequential improvement to our costs. And fourth, our costs include a higher level of expense related to inventory reserves than we had in our original estimates for 2012. ", "In terms of pricing, we expect some degree of supply-demand imbalance to continue in the second quarter and we expect an improved supply-demand balance in the second half. Factoring in these assumptions, as well as our forecasted product mix, we expect our total non-GAAP gross margin to decline in Q2 to approximately 28%, plus or minus 2 points. We currently expect the rate of price decline and cost decline to be similar in the second half, with product mix helping to improve this comparison. And we believe this will lead to gross margins at approximately the Q2 level and possibly improving modestly. ", "Non-GAAP operating expenses for Q2 are forecasted to be approximately $225 million, with the sequential growth primarily in R&D and also in G&A due to the legal credit reflected in Q1 results. Given our lower revenue and margin expectations for 2012, we are lowering our expense forecast to $920 million on a non-GAAP basis for the year, down from the $975 million we shared in January. This reflects reduced incentive compensation and a somewhat reduced rate of hiring, with year-over-year growth primarily focused in R&D. We expect non-GAAP other income to be approximately $5 million on a quarterly basis, and we forecast an effective tax rate of approximately 30%. With our decision to pause Fab 5 expansion for the remainder of the year, our 2012 capital investments are now forecasted to be at the lower end of the $1.1 billion to $1.6 billion range we provided in January. We now expect free cash flow, exclusive of M&A, to be negative in the first half of the year and positive for the second half of the year. We plan to continue utilization of our share repurchase plan, with an objective of holding our share count approximately constant from the end of 2011. We are disappointed with our results and near-term outlook, but continue to be confident in the medium- to long-term growth prospects of our industry and SanDisk. We expect an improved industry supply-demand environment in the second half, and we are adjusting our embedded product mix to leverage the growth opportunities in the mobile markets. We are pleased with our SSD progress and expect that the contribution of our SSD products to our growth will accelerate across 2012 and beyond. ", "In summary, we are managing our product and our capacity investments to return to growth and stronger profitability. We will now open the call for your questions.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Judy. Jamie, could you poll the floor for questions, please? And if I can ask the callers to ask one question and a brief follow-up, that would be appreciated.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I was wondering if you could maybe comment on the overall NAND bit growth supply outlook for 2012. What have you been hearing in terms of competitors? Do you have any adjustments to your overall industry bit growth expectations for 2012? And then where do you think SanDisk will come in relative to those?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So in terms of the industry bit growth, third party estimates, put it on an average around 71% over 2011. And I think their high end is around 75%. We think that the industry bit growth will be likely higher than the averages that are estimated by the third parties. Regarding SanDisk bit growth itself, we have said earlier that given it will be somewhat less than last year's bit growth, and last year's bit growth was 77% and given the improvements in our 19 nanometer ramp, as well as 19 nanometer yield, we would expect our bit growth to be somewhat higher than our prior expectation.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then, I guess, maybe you could give us a little bit of commentary on the Fab 5 restart. Clearly, things are weaker so you're pushing out the capacity additions, but what are the factors you look to determine when and whether you should restart that and when is the first opportunity that you could do that? Is that early in 2013 or potentially even later than that?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So the main factors that we look at is our demand assessment for the future, as well as our status of our technology and yields and production ramp. And based on that, we have decided that we will not restart the ramp anytime this year. So the earliest it could start is in 2013, some time. We have not made a determination of the timing. But again, the factors that we look at will be the future demand assessments and our overall supply requirements. And generally, in terms of equipment to add capacity, you need around 4 to 6 months. And if we continue to work closely with the equipment suppliers in terms of managing the timing of the deliveries to meet our future requirements in the fabs.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.", "Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Sanjay, as you think about the embedded products that you're repositioning for the changing smartphone OEM requirements that you talked about, what gives you confidence that with those coming to market or being developed in 2Q, you're going to get design-ins [ph] right away in the back half and what's the risk that those products really don't get designed in until 2013?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So some of those products actually are already in the design phase. As I said, they are already in qualification stage and those qualifications will complete in Q2 and ready for production ramp starting Q3 and continue to grow and increase our opportunity in shares in second half. And some of the products are in late stages of development, and we plan to enter qualifications in the second quarter. And they will continue to -- we'll continue to work with the customers and work on the qualifications. And I'm feeling confident that with the strong track record that SanDisk has on execution, I believe that our engineering execution will come through successfully with respect to the second half opportunities. And again, I would like to remind you that we work with all leading mobile OEMs and we continue to work closely with them, interact with them and work on understanding their business requirements and giving them visibility to our roadmap and the status of the products, and work very closely with them in terms of qualifications. So I have high confidence. And these new products basically leverage SanDisk's core strength in terms of our technology, in terms of our systems expertise and in terms of our manufacturing expertise. So really, they go to the heart of our core strengths and we have good confidence in terms of our ability to ramp them in the second half.", "Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And can you state [ph] if those are 16- and 32-gig products or are those lower density 8-gig products?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Actually, they range in capacities, from low capacity to high capacity. As you know, their embedded requirements have a wide range of products across the host of -- across the slew of mobile devices. And these products will be in all those ranges, I mean full capacity range.", "Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then as a follow-up, but switching to the SSD side of the business, the company got into the year looking for SSDs to be about 10% of sales, and Kanau [ph] with a much slower revenue growth outlook. But with other companies like Intel saying a much bigger number of ultrabook designs for 2012 than they were looking for just 2 or 3 months ago, why wouldn't we expect to see your SSD business be a much greater percent of sales this year than 10%?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So as we had earlier said that we expect SSD business to be approximately 10% of our 2012 revenue, and we are saying now that we expect it to be more than 10% of our business. Keep in mind, we are absolutely expecting strong growth in our embedded business in the second half of the year as well. And certainly, as the price points become more attractive in the NAND industry, this will accelerate the adoption of SSD and the growth of SSD positively as well.", "Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Can you quantify how much greater than 10% you'd expect, Sanjay?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Not really. I think we are very focused on continuing to drive and maximize our opportunities in widening the product portfolio. But at this point, I would say more than 10%.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Daniel Berenbaum with MKM Partners.", "Daniel A. Berenbaum - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "Sanjay, you've alluded to potential changes in the card market. Can you elaborate on that a little bit? Are you talking about just the density of cards not increasing as you expected? Or are you talking about overall slower card unit sales? Can you help me understand what's going on there?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So as you know, the mobile phone market has been extremely dynamic and you know there are significant share shifts happening in that market. And several of the handset manufacturers have tremendous pressure to reduce their BOM costs. They have tremendous pressure from network operators as well to reduce the BOM costs. So each one is addressing these in somewhat different fashion. In some cases, they are not -- they have reduced their bundling of the cards with the slotted phones. In other cases, they have lowered the capacity of the card that they were previously bundling. Some are also -- have indicated to us that they are counting on more bundling happening in the region, with the network operators potentially bundling cards with the phones depending upon the demand considerations and the consumer profile for the regions. So there is a variety of steps that these mobile handset device makers have taken in terms of managing some of the cost pressures that they have. And of course, this is including -- these are phones with embedded flash, and in some cases, some of this is also going towards phones with embedded flash. And as I said in my prepared remarks, this could mean opportunity in the retail channel that the card for the aftermarket with the mobile phone demand picks up. It's just too early to tell that to what extent. To the extent that any of these card demands moves from bundling to the retail channel, as you know, we are very well positioned across the globe in terms of our retail brand and retail sales distribution channels. And we are leading global shares, so we will be able to benefit from that trend to the extent that it materializes.", "Daniel A. Berenbaum - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "And what percentage of your OEM business now is card versus embedded?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We have said that's about -- just keep in mind that our SSD business is increasing, right? So when we talk about OEM business, that now just not only includes cards and embedded and, of course, USB drives, but also now includes SSD. So our total card business, which includes selling to these OEMs, as well as selling to the white label channels, that total business, that's what we classify. That's where the cards are addressed. And we have said before that within OEM, our embedded business is approximately -- for first quarter, approximately 32% in the first quarter. About 1/3 of our OEM business is cards -- is embedded. So the rest is cards plus SSD. And SSD is included in that total number of OEMs. But let me just be clear again, the 33% is embedded.", "Daniel A. Berenbaum - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. Okay. And then sorry,. Judy, just one last question. You talked about $24 million in inventory charges this quarter, if I heard you right. Do you anticipate more inventory charges in Q2?", "Judy Bruner", "It is possible that we will take additional inventory charges in Q2. As I said, we do expect some level of supply-demand imbalance to continue into Q2. And that could result in us taking additional inventory charges depending on the forward-looking -- the pricing in Q2, as well as the forward-looking forecast of pricing and product mix, but we are adjusting our product mix in order to rely less on some of the low-priced channels.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "I was just wondering, going back to the last question, how much of your exposure is bundled cards on the handset side specifically?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Bundled cards in the first quarter approximately contributed to -- I mean, contributed approximately 10% of our total revenue.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Again, that's the segment where you're seeing some dislocation, where OEMs might stop bundling cards or they're trying different strategies, right?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "That's right.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And when you look at the inventory in the channel between -- on the handset side, especially with the market share shifts, you mentioned you work with your engineering expertise, you are trying to restrategize your approach to that market. The one guy that you're not having exposure, obviously the biggest, the #1 guy on the handset side, on the smartphone side. How do you see your prospects there given your expertise and your position in the handset market?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So as we have said before, we are a supplier to all leading mobile handset suppliers. So we really are a supplier to all leading handset manufacturers. So we are, and the opportunities that we have in the works will be addressing the entire set of mobile OEM handsets.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Do you expect in the second half to be able to supply to the #1 smartphone handset supplier in the market today?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Actually, we expect that to be increasing in the second half because we are already supplying to all of them today and we expect with our strong product roadmap to increase our share there.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Sidney Ho with Nomura.", "Sidney Ho - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "So if I do my math right, looking at the second half of the year just to get to revenue breakeven with the previous year, you kind of need 15% a quarter for each of the next 2 quarters, which is pretty big relative to the last 5 years. Should I think of demand in terms of unit as similar versus pricing, maybe a little better?", "Judy Bruner", "So Sidney, I said in my prepared remarks that we now expect the full year revenue for 2012 to be less than the revenue that we achieved in 2011. That said, we do expect strong sequential growth in the revenue in Q3 and in Q4.", "Sidney Ho - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. And then my follow-up question is that follow-up to the last question. It seems to me that if you're not the top 2 OEM in the smartphones, you're kind of out of luck at least for the first half of this year. How are you confident that when you start seeing the build this year, that you're not really setting up another inventory corrections towards the end of the year?", "Judy Bruner", "Again, we said that we are supplying to all of the mobile handset providers, but we expect that we will be able to increase our share in many places, including with the leading mobile handset providers in the second half. And as Sanjay said, many of those new embedded products are already in qualification. So we're quite confident in our ability to increase our share and exposure with many of the leading mobile OEMs in the second half and to grow our revenue sequentially because of that, but also because of the accelerating growth of our SSD revenue and also because we believe there will be an improved supply-demand environment, which will mean a lower level of price decline in the second half. And clearly, we believe that our actions in terms of managing our capacity growth in Fab 5 will help us achieve the right level of supply-demand balance.", "Sidney Ho - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Just to clarify, so do you have visibility, pretty good visibility about the design wins, not the units through the end of the year by now?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "As we said, we are in qualifications with several new platforms. And yes, we have visibility to the design win opportunities and we are engaged with them, and certain of the products are under qualification, under development and they will complete development and qualification in the second quarter for our second half growth opportunities.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Jagadish Iyer with Piper Jaffray.", "Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Two questions. First, I just want to understand, Sanjay, what do you think your market share would be by the end of this year in terms of the overall embedded market, and where do you see that going forward by end of '13? And I have a follow-up.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "In terms of the market shares, overall, I would say that in the first half for the total embedded market, our market share is somewhat challenged. But let me be very clear that for the iNAND market specifically, we will be maintaining our share in the first half, Q1 as well as Q2. As I mentioned, due to the fast-evolving requirements in the mobile market, particularly with the leading handset providers, some of their embedded solution requirements have moved towards certain customs and proprietary solutions, including MCP. And those are the ones that are in development. Obviously, we don't have share in that section today for those new products. But as we qualify them in the second half, we will be significantly increasing our share in the embedded market with complete set of product offerings to address most of the opportunities in this market segment, both mobile phone as well as the tablet segment.", "Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay. Just a follow up, Judy, and how should we think about -- I know you kind of gave some parameters on gross margins, but I just wanted to understand on how the pricing environment is for the SSD segment. Is it also weaker in the first half? Can you give some qualitative comments, please?", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. Actually, the pricing environment in the overall NAND industry has less of an impact on our SSD products than it does on most of the other products in our portfolio. And so our increasing SSD mix, we believe, is a positive for our product mix and for our margins. But keep in mind that our SSD mix is not going to be significant enough this year to materially impact our overall gross margin profile, but it is an improving factor in our gross margins.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Ryan Goodman with CLSA.", "Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "First, I just wanted to know if you could comment on what you are seeing in SSD inventory in the channel at the OEMs. I know it did pretty well for you guys. I've been hearing from others that there is some build out there.", "Judy Bruner", "Actually from what we can see of the channel inventory, we believe it is at normal levels, both in our OEM channels as well as in our retail channels.", "Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just one other question on SSDs. I know in the Analyst Day you had a slide showing maybe 25% or so of the notebook SSD, these are just Client SSDs, this year would be the dual-drive form factor where you have some cache with the HDD. First, just how is that looking at this point, we're a couple of months later and starting to see how the price points are coming out. And two, if that does end up shifting to more of the dual-drive solutions, how do you think about it? Is that a positive in terms of potential future gains just given your iSSD product offering or is that more of a negative just in terms of overall goods being shipped?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "I didn't fully get the first part of your question and I would like to ask you to please repeat it, but let me first answer the second part of your question. With respect to the dual-drive opportunity, we actually look at it as a very strong opportunity for SSDs. Dual-drives will be bigger part of the market, we believe, in the ultrabook. And with our strong lineup of product offering, both from the cost sensitive part product offerings as well as high-performance product offerings, we are very well positioned. And then on top of that, the conducive formerly Diskeeper caching opportunities that really will enable to deliver strong performance with that software. All of that will really bode well. So I think, basically the dual-drive opportunity is a very strong opportunity. Of course, it comes at lower average capacity per unit compared to a standalone hard disk drive in a notebook device or in a ultrabook or mobile device. But units will be very large and this is a large opportunity for SSDs. And I would like to ask you to please repeat your first question.", "Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "Yes, I guess, just at the Analyst Day, I had seen a slide in your deck that showed that you got maybe 25% or so of the total notebook SSD opportunity in 2012, would be these dual-drive solutions. We're just a couple of months later, so I wanted to get an update on that on where you're seeing things play out in the pipeline.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "I think that trend overall continues to look very positive in this regard. I mean, you'll hear announcements, as well as Intel continuing to really update the market in terms of by end of the year 40% to be ultrabooks. And it's a strong growth opportunity there for SSD. So I think all trends are looking good.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Bob Gujavarty with Deutsche Bank.", "Bobby Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I mean, my question is a little bit more strategic, I guess, in that -- I mean, if I look at what you've done on a revenue basis, I mean, if I look at a 5-year CAGR from kind of '07 through '12 now based on the new guidance, your revenues actually have undergrown Intel by a significant amount. And I don't think most investors would consider Intel a growth company. So I was just curious if you have rethought your company as more of a traditional semi company that focuses on cash returns, dividends and stock buybacks because it doesn't appear you've been very successful in terms of growing the top line.", "Judy Bruner", "Bob, I view 2012 as a speed bump in terms of our growth trajectory. And we're disappointed with this result, but we believe we will get back into a growth environment again. And so I would just say that calculating through the 2012 number is somewhat putting the damper on that calculation. And we believe that we are in a favorable growth industry. We believe that over the next several quarters and couple of years that we will be gaining share in some of the faster growing segments of the industry, such as SSDs. And we believe that in the second half of this year, we'll have a very strong and diversified portfolio, particularly with these embedded products that we are adding to the mix.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "And our leadership in technology and costs, which is key for our ability to drive the growth in these markets, is really continuing to be very strong as well. So I think the industry fundamental, the demand drivers are very strong, as well as all the fundamentals that are within SanDisk's control. We really are continuing to do a good job and that we are very excited about the opportunities ahead for us in embedded and SSD business, while continuing to have a solid position on the retail side of the business, retail and card and USB drive side of the business as well.", "Bobby Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. Maybe a quick follow-up then. It seems like this downturn is a little bit different than previous downturns in that most of the industry and yourself have been very disciplined in terms of your investments and your CapEx. Would you agree with that assessment and that previous downturns are driven by some excess investment while this one is a little bit different?", "Judy Bruner", "I agree with that, Bob, that it is a little different in that regard. And in fact, that is what gives us optimism for coming out of this. You used the word downturn. I'm not sure I would use the word downturn as opposed to a speed bump. But coming out of this, I would say, easily than in the past in terms of cycles that we've encountered in the past. And as we think about 2013, we believe that the industry bit supply growth for 2013 is likely to be in the 50% to 60% range. We've shared that previously. And now, with these lower prices in 2012, which admittedly are weighing on our top line and our bottom line, but with these lower prices we believe we could see an acceleration of elasticity in some of the key markets, in particular the SSD markets, and also to some extent in tablets and smartphones also. So that gives us the optimism that we can come out of this cycle and return back to the strong profitability and growth that we have enjoyed for the last couple of years and do that more easily than in the last cycle.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "And I would just also like to add that compared to the past, the markets that NAND flash is addressing today are diverse, very large. I mean we are looking at 1 billion smartphones in another 3-years-or-so timeframe. We are looking at tablets, 600-plus million units of tablets, in a similar timeframe on a per year basis. And so these are very, very large markets now compared to few years ago. And of course, as you pointed out, the supply restraint that is generally shown in the industry has been very different compared to the past as well.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Betsy Van Hees with Wedbush Securities.", "Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "I was wondering if you could help us understand a little bit in terms of what the design cycles are for your embedded products, what the design cycles are for SSDs given that the mobile business, you're talking about qualifications that are going to happen in Q2 that are currently in the works. And then you have other products that are in development. And so if you could help us understand how those design cycles will play out, it would be great, I'd really appreciate it.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So in terms of, let's say mobile OEM manufacturers, before we have a product qualified by customers, we, of course, qualify it internally and then we share that data qualifications with the customers, as well as work with them for them to qualify our products. And typically, their cycles, qualification cycles can take varying amount of time depending upon the timing of various model introductions. But generally, they could be anywhere from 1 month to 2 months or so before products get typically qualified by mobile OEMs. On the SSD side, qualifications tend to take a little longer. And of course, on the Enterprises SSD side, they take even longer.", "Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "And then, Judy, you talked about the pricing environment in the first half of the year being, I think, I don't know if tough's the right word, and in the second half of the year, I think you said you still expected some pricing pressure. Is that how I heard that correctly?", "Judy Bruner", "Not exactly. What I said is that I do expect there to continue to be some supply-demand imbalance in the second quarter, and therefore, a gap between what we expect in terms of pricing and what we expect in terms of cost decline. By the second half, we believe we'll be in a much improved supply-demand environment given reduced capacity growth in the industry and/or continued essentially very low capacity growth and strong demand cycles and the seasonality of the second half.", "Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "So are you expecting NAND prices to be flat or go up in the second half of the year? Is that what you're thinking is going to happen?", "Judy Bruner", "No, I didn't necessarily say that, but we're expecting a much improved pricing environment, meaning much lower level of price decline than what we see in the first half.", "Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "And then one last question, in terms of your OEM business, how much of that OEM business was embedded?", "Judy Bruner", "Sanjay answered that question earlier, and what he said is that the embedded was about 1/3 of our OEM business, with the OEM business including our SSD businesses.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Philip Lee with Lazard Capital Markets.", "Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "This is actually Daniel Amir. A couple of questions here. First of all, in terms of -- the other cycles were basically a lot more supply driven in terms of the decline in the market. And just a follow-up to a previous question, do you think that other players in the industry will follow kind of the more disciplined supply approach that you've taken here, in fairly quickly actually correcting kind of your behavior in order to address this market? And then I have one follow-up question.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "I think if you look at last couple of years or so, even last 3 years, I think industry really has shown the strain in terms of growing capacity, adding capacity. And speaking for ourselves, we certainly are very committed to it and we continue to manage this very closely. And based on the reports that you hear in the media, I believe that rest of the industry is continuing to demonstrate supply growth constraints as well.", "Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And with regards to the white label comment, can you better explain why, for instance, for Q1 you actually sold a lot into the white label card market, and in Q2, you're stepping away from that market? Can you just help explain kind of why you're doing that or why you're changing that?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So as some of the card bundling demand from our mobile OEMs reduced in the first quarter, particularly in the second half of the first quarter, we decided to make up for some of that lost revenue opportunity into the white label channel. And we sold more in that white label channel. And of course, as you know, the pricing environment in the industry in the second half declined considerably as well. So regarding the second quarter, when we look at white label channel, our considerations are that we want to make sure that it meets some of our profitability objectives. And this is why we believe that we will be reducing our sales into the channel in the second quarter.", "Operator", "And we'll take that final question from Mark Newman with Sanford Bernstein.", "Mark C. Newman - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "I had one quick question on your node transition. So normally, as new next advanced node of NAND flash is sold into the market and ramped up, we see some performance hit and lower level of endurance in the NAND components and often lower prices. I just wondered if you're seeing a lower level of performance or endurance in your 19 nanometer NAND flash and hence, any kind of lower pricing for that versus more mature nodes?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Let me be very clear that our 19 nanometer flash memory components are among the best quality components in the industry in terms of their specification. And of course, as you advance the technology generation, flash memory scaling becomes more challenging and the reliability considerations do become more difficult. And this is where you need the system expertise and the controllers and advanced algorithms that are implemented in those controllers to overcome the inherent weaknesses of some of the memory aspects. So in terms of memory component alone, we have high reliability components. But in terms of our system level solutions, they're our controllers, it manages the performance and the reliability and the operation of the flash memory, we have very high reliability products and no degradation in overall certifications going from one generation at the systems level to the next generation of system level products.", "Mark C. Newman - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "I see, fair enough. So you're not seeing a hit from the node transition then? It seems to be mostly pricing from the markets overall and maybe even a mix transition due to your move to more white label costs, perhaps. Going forward to second half, you mentioned the demand strengthening, fully understand that. Any comments on demand for 2013?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So as you look at the market demand drivers, the smartphones, the tablets, Client SSD growing, Enterprise SSD growing, so all of these really point to strong growth drivers. So we think demand will continue to build up in 2013 as well, and overall demand trends are continuing to be strong, even in 2012. It's really only the card bundling aspects that we refer to that really has impacted some of the demand trends. So I think the fundamentals of demand growth strength in our industries continue to be strong, and we definitely believe that they will be strong in 2013 as well. And to your earlier comment, yes, you're absolutely right that 19 nanometer has nothing to do with any aspect of supply or excess supply or price decline in the industry. It is really just only that in the industry, there is some excess supply, more supply than what was previously expected and a little bit of an impact in terms of demand side, particularly related to bundling, causing some exaggerated imbalance and steep price decline.", "Jay Iyer", "Unfortunately, that's all the time we have today. We would like to thank everyone for joining us, and a webcast replay of today's call should be available on our IR website at sandisk.com/ir.

[Operator Instructions] I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investors section of WD's website immediately following the conclusion of this call. ", "I will now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer of WD, John Coyne.", "John F. Coyne", "Thank you, Bob. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's call. After my introductory remarks, Wolfgang Nickl, our CFO, will review our Q3 financial performance and the outlook for the fourth quarter. ", "We are delighted to report these exceptional financial results for the March quarter, demonstrating the potential of the new WD with just 3.5 weeks of HGST results added to the standalone WD business. ", "Competing in the marketplace through our WD and HGST subsidiaries, we now have the product portfolio, technology resources and the people to focus on serving the needs of a significantly expanded customer base and to better address the tremendous growth opportunities in the storage industry in the years ahead. ", "IDC expects the amount of digital storage capacity shipped across all digital storage media will more than double by 2015 from 767 exabytes in 2012. With the HDD storage responsible for roughly 70% of exabyte shipments over this time frame, driven by mobility, connectivity and the cloud. These dynamics create the need for an increasingly diverse set of products and technology capabilities from storage solutions providers. ", "Rotating magnetic storage continues to be the dominant technology in this highest volume, high-capacity storage markets based on availability, scalability, usability and value. The recently updated IDC forecast calls for hard drive unit volume growth of 10% per year from 2011 to 2016, another indicator of the tremendous growth opportunity at hand for the new WD. ", "When we announced the HGST acquisition in March 2011, we emphasized that this would be the hard drive industry's first ever transaction involving 2 profitable and growing companies, and that this was significant because of the resultant customer breadth and product breadth, depth of technology, people and scale. We are highly focused on what we believe is a tremendous revenue opportunity for the new WD based on the value proposition offered to our customers by each subsidiary. We aim to continue the strong track record of customer delight and superior financial performance of each subsidiary by delivering efficiencies consistent with regulatory requirements. ", "It is noteworthy that during more than 12 months of regulatory reviews and 2 natural disasters, WD and HGST teams maintained full engagement with customers and continued to invest and execute to develop and deliver multiple innovative products. I call your attention to an impressive list of recent innovations outlined in the expanded quarterly investment summary report on our website. ", "Some examples include: The shipment of the industry's first 2-terabyte, 2.5-inch My Passport hard drives for mobile personal storage; the industry's first 1-terabyte 10,000 RPM, 2.5-inch WD VelociRaptor hard drive for high-performance workstations and extreme gaming platforms; the industry's first 4-terabyte, 7,200 RPM, 3.5-inch Ultrastar drive for the capacity enterprise and cloud infrastructure markets; the industry's first SAS enterprise class SSD to use 25-nanometer single-level cell NAND flash technology, the 400-gigabyte Ultrastar SSD; the industry's first 7,200 RPM, 2.5-inch, 7-millimeter, 500-gigabyte Travelstar mobile hard drive, extending our lead in the low-profile drive market, where to date, we have shipped more than 25 million 7-millimeter hard drives for use in slim notebooks and Ultrabooks. ", "We also announced the formation of a consortium with SanDisk, Twentieth Century Fox and Warner Bros. to advance digital distribution and consumer ownership of high-definition movies. ", "With the HGST acquisition now closed, we're working closely with China's Ministry of Commerce to finalize our operations plan in compliance with the remedy outlined in MOFCOM's approval decision last month. Concurrently, Toshiba is awaiting the completion of the regulatory review process, associated with its agreement to acquire certain WD and HGST assets, a process that is expected to be completed within the next 90 days. In the meantime, we continue to support customer demand for the products covered by the anticipated Toshiba transaction. ", "I'm also pleased to announce today that the recovery activities related to both WD operations and those of our supply chain partners impacted by the Thailand floods have reached the point where we now have the capability to adequately meet anticipated customer demand in the current quarter and beyond. Our subsidiaries are now focused on profitably serving customer needs in terms of both mix and volume. ", "We have navigated successfully through a series of significant events in the last year, including the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which had a substantial supply chain impact on both HGST and WD and the floods in Thailand, which knocked out almost 90% of WD's slider availability and 60% of WD drive assembly capacity and a substantial portion of the industry supply chain. Concurrently, we completed the largest acquisition in the history of the hard drive industry. I want to thank our customers and suppliers for their strong support throughout this time and to congratulate and thank all of our employees whose dedicated efforts have delivered such outstanding results. ", "As I look at the opportunities for Western Digital in the quarters and years ahead, I cannot think of a more exciting time to be leading this talented team. We have just delivered the strongest revenue and profit performance in the company's 42-year history, with the contribution of less than a month of HGST performance. ", "We have a series of upside opportunities that have energized our teams against the backdrop of a recovering industry TAM in the near term and the storage industry's significant growth opportunity in the long term, we are focused on delighting our customers with an improving mix of compelling products, growing to full utilization of our installed capacity over time and continuing the measured deployment of our newer technologies. ", "With that, I will turn the call over to Wolfgang for a review of our Q3 financials and our outlook.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Thanks, John. A summary of historical financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. We have also included a detailed GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in this package. ", "We'd also like to remind you that we have announced our Investor Day to be held on September 13, 2012, here in Orange County. On that day, we expect to discuss our strategy for our core business, growth opportunities, our go-forward business model and our cash utilization strategy. ", "Today, I will first summarize our financial performance for last quarter and will then provide a range of expected financial results for the June quarter. The data of our third fiscal quarter includes HGST results from the acquisitions date of March 8 through the end of our quarter. ", "Revenue for the March quarter was $3 billion, including $614 million for HGST. We shipped a total of 44.2 million hard drives at an average selling price of approximately $68. ", "OEM sales represented 64% of revenue, distribution channel sales were 28% and retail sales were 8%. The retail channel percentage was lower than prior quarters due to a total available market that is running at about 1/2 of last year's run rate and Hitachi's lower presence in that channel. ", "Our gross margin for the quarter was 32.2%. This includes acquisition accounting-related adjustments. Excluding these adjustments, non-GAAP gross margin was 35.5%. Average cost per unit continues to run above pre-flood level due to lower capacity utilization, increased use of air freight, a higher mix of externally procured heads and higher costs for other components as a result of the flood's impact on our supply chain partners. ", "R&D and SG&A spending totaled $420 million for the March quarter. SG&A included acquisition-related expenses of $33 million and $3 million of amortization expense related to intangibles recorded through the purchase price allocation. R&D and SG&A spending reflect continued investments in new product and market development, particularly in the branded and enterprise areas. ", "Flood-related expenses totaled $36 million, which was offset by $21 million in insurance recoveries and other cost reimbursements. During the quarter, we filed a significant claim for property damage, which is currently in the early stage of evaluation by our insurance carriers. We also expect to file business interruption and other claims. ", "Net interest and other non-operating expense was $4 million, including $1 million of credit commitment fees prior to the acquisition. Tax expense for the March quarter was $55 million or 10.2% of pretax income. Our net income for the March quarter totaled $483 million, a $1.96 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $619 million or $2.52 per share. ", "Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $1.2 billion in cash from operations during the March quarter, and our free cash flow totaled $1.1 billion, significantly enhanced by the timing of the acquisition. ", "Capital spending and depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $139 million and $188 million, respectively. Through the first 9 months of fiscal 2012, we have spent $393 million on capital. We expect capital spending of approximately $357 million for the current quarter, bringing the total for fiscal year 2012 to approximately $750 million, inclusive of HGST capital spending for the June quarter. ", "Capital expenditures for the June quarter will be driven by flood recovery, technology investments and investments n process capability as opposed to capacity expansion. As a reminder, we report capital spending based on cash disbursements. Thus, the capital disbursements expected for the June quarter primarily reflect capital that was received during the March quarter. ", "Our conversion cycle was a positive 5 days. The DSO, DIO and DPO calculations, as well as inventory turns are skewed by the fact that our March ending balance sheet includes full HGST accounts receivable, inventory and account payables, but our revenue and cost of sales include only 3.5 weeks of HGST's operations. ", "We exited fiscal Q3 with total cash and cash equivalents of $3.4 billion, with approximately $1.3 billion in the U.S. and $2.1 billion offshore. Subtracting our total debt of $2.7 billion, results in a net cash balance of $634 million. ", "HGST's purchase price for accounting purposes was approximately $4.7 billion. While purchase price allocation included goodwill of approximately $1.7 billion and other intangibles of about $800 million. On a full quarter run rate basis, we expect the intangibles to drive amortization expense of approximately $50 million. These amounts are preliminary. Updated amounts will appear in the 10-Q we will file in early May. ", "Let me now provide some context for our guidance for the June quarter. We expect the TAM for the June quarter in a range of 155 million to 160 million units. We believe there is sufficient capacity in the industry to support this demand. From a volume perspective, we have modeled the previously announced divestiture of certain 3.5-inch assets to Toshiba to close towards the end of May. ", "With regard to pricing, it's important to note that our WD subsidiary was the most heavily impacted of any drive company by the floods in Thailand last October. WD asked for and received customer support to enable a rapid recovery. Now that this recovery is essentially complete, WD is forecasting pricing reflective of current market conditions. ", "After we close the acquisition, we learned that our HGST subsidiary, which was not directly impacted by the floods, had implemented multi-quarter agreements with certain customers that provided for June pricing below March pricing subject to the achievement of certain volume goals. ", "WD's subsidiary continues to operate with substantially -- substantial underutilized capacity and at a supply mix of external heads in excess of the subsidiary's strategic sourcing model. Both factors lead to a cost disadvantage of several dollars when compared to its pre-flood levels. ", "While we are identifying OpEx synergies that are consistent with regulatory requirements, we are not factoring any of these synergies into our guidance, as we are currently working with China's MOFCOM to finalize the operations plan, which we submitted earlier this month. In addition, we are continuing investments in strategic growth areas such as SSD, hybrid drives and the digital home. ", "From a gross margin perspective, we believe that product mix and cost will provide significant future upside potential for our businesses as they managed the deployment of new areal densities in a measured fashion. ", "I also want to note that our guidance is in a non-GAAP basis. It excludes amortization of intangibles related to the HGST acquisition of approximately $40 million in cost of sales and $10 million in OpEx. We also excludes any P&L impact from the pending divestiture of 3.5-inch assets to Toshiba and any potential restructuring activities. Our forecast does not include any acquisition of flood-related expenses, nor does it factor in any flood-related insurance proceeds during the quarter. ", "With these factors in mind, our June quarter guidance including a full quarter of HGST is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion. R&D and SG&A spending will be approximately $550 million. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 9% of our taxable income. We anticipate our share count to be approximately 269 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $2.35 and $2.55 for the June quarter. ", "Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montr\u00e9al.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "John, I wanted to get your take on the status of the inventory deficit in drives. And so Seagate's talked a lot about their perspective on how short the industry is on drives. Yet when the OEMs talk, it seem to have more than enough drives, the ODMs in Taiwan have similar comments. If you could just speak to where is the deficit in drives? And how long do you think, if there is such a deficit, how long do you think it persists?", "John F. Coyne", "Sure. I think in terms of mobile 2.5-inch drives for the PC industry, I think we're in reasonable balance. The difference from traditional situation is that the inventory instead of being in HDD industry, JIT hubs is in the OEM's own inventory, the PC manufacturers and the ODMs. So as of today, I believe the majority of that business is being done on a direct ship from factory basis so that, that inventory shifted from HDD-owned to customer-owned. And we think that, that business is in reasonable balance relative to supply and demand and traditional inventory levels. The desktop, we think is a little short, and we'll, from an OEM perspective, we'll take through this quarter to approach a balanced situation. Likewise, in -- on the enterprise side, we think performance enterprise is reasonably balanced, capacity enterprise demand continues to exceed supply. And then when we move into the distribution channels, we're looking at inventory levels in the distribution channels that are substantially below those that were the norm pre-flood, about half the level that was typically carried pre-flood and when we look in the retail channels, a similar situation, inventories are still somewhat light. So I think we're going to see...", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Very helpful, John. Just my follow-up then will be is what's your expectations for September quarter, the ability to drive manufacturing, what do you say the unit TAM per output would be from September quarter? And then I'll cede the floor.", "John F. Coyne", "Well, I think we're looking at a difficult to predict situation in that. This quarter, our estimate of the TAM supposes a 10% quarter-over-quarter growth. If we look seasonally on a traditional basis, we would have expected a flat to down demand relative to last quarter. We think that's a pent-up issue that creates that both back towards normal. We're still, I think, about 4% on a year-over-year, the 160 number for the June quarter would be compared with 166 a year ago. So there's still a little bit of catch up to do to get -- then we expect in the back of the year, we'll see typical quarter-over-quarter progression that tends to be in the 10% range. And that will translate into very substantially year-over-year increases obviously because of the flood impact in October.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "I just wanted to make sure I understood your comments about being able to meet demand in the quarter. I mean, is that much more of a function of whether it's sourcing from TDK heads or, I guess, Hitachi's in-house ability to meet its own needs versus actually building all those sliders out of Thailand and back to pre-flood production capability in-house?", "John F. Coyne", "Yes, Rich. The comment relates to our ability to satisfy customers with the drive-level product through both our subsidiaries. And we believe we'll be in a good position this quarter to turn our focus from building raw capacity to turning our focus to matching mix requirements within the overall capacity required by our customers in the current quarter. As I think, both I and Wolfgang noted in our prepared remarks, we still have a significant installed capacity under absorption issue from a cost perspective in the WD sub. And we are currently sourcing above the typical WD external/internal head sourcing rule, our business model that we have set for the long-term. However, as we look forward, we forecast continuing TAM growth each quarter through the balance of the year. And then sustained growth in the industry as we move forward from there. So looked at in a medium to long-term perspective, we're very excited by the opportunities, and we see substantial opportunity for us to continue to improve performance as those cost drags on the business are eliminated by growth as we move forward.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just secondly, regarding your comments about Hitachi signing of a few LTAs at lower prices than March., can you give some quantification of just how far below and what markets might have been involved, and more importantly, your ability to perhaps prevent that type of decision-making in the future within the confines of the Chinese regulators?", "John F. Coyne", "Well, I think, I mean, you kind of characterized; that, that might not have been a desirable action. I believe it is a highly desirable action to provide assurance of security or supply to customers and to be competitive in addressing market opportunity, thereby, increasing business with certain customers and securing that business into the future. So while the prices are lower in the June quarter than they were in the March quarter based on the total package offered to those customers, business is highly desirable and significantly accretive to the overall well-being of the business. So we're explaining the dynamics of the current market not indicating any kind of problem.", "Operator", "Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I don't know if you can do this or not, but last quarter you talked about an expectation that your average capacity per drive would be down sequentially in the March quarter. Can you provide us any color on what that look like this quarter as we think about optimizing the mix? And what you are expecting them to be into the June quarter? And then I do have a follow-up.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes. The average capacity last quarter was indeed down in all the WD business, lowest single-digit percentage. And we expect that mix to pick up this quarter for the WD sub. The HGST sub mix is a little bit impacted that -- since the June quarter was a quarter where the gaming business picked up and there's a more substantial volume of gaming units and that impacts the mix there.", "John F. Coyne", "But you could -- you should also assume that as we move through the balance of the year, we will return and both business is likely to operate at market mix.", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And then my follow-up question is on your guys' slide deck, you guys have a highlighted business model, gross margin, which looks like it's the prior model of 18% to 23%, 9% to 10% OpEx to revenue. I'm curious, is that the model you're out and want to talk to the Street about? Or is that just an old -- reference to the old model because I think guys have given flavor for higher gross margins in particular post the; Hitachi? Any color on how you're thinking about the long-term model and the context of that?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Good observation, Aaron. It's the old model. We haven't officially updated our model. We expect to do so in our September Investor Day. We've given some directional color in the supplemental information that we've provided right when the acquisition closed in -- on March 8, I believe. And from that directional guidance, you can imply that we believe that the gross margin is slightly higher than the June 19 to 24 that we said a year ago. And we also highlighted that the OpEx might be a little bit higher and well, you have to wait for the outcome of the operating plan, operations plan that we're concluding with MOFCOM to specify that. And again, the go-forward model will be communicated at the Investor Day on September 13.", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And on that, it looks like you're implying about a 30% to 31% gross margin this current quarter. Is that fair?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "For guidance for the current quarter, that's correct.", "Operator", "Rob Cihra with Evercore Partners.", "Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "2 questions if I could. One, I'm just wondering -- I know you didn't in this, but I want to know if you're planning to or not to report or give even any color on the split between WD and HGST units. And then separate from that, if I look at your OpEx guidance of $550 million, it would imply no cost savings from HGST, which I get and I understand, as you guys have communicated, obviously the regulatory constraints. But are there not even any amount of OpEx cut there or savings or synergies you think you're actually be able to get the near-term before 2 years?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes. Well, so the -- on your first question, we're not planning in the future to split out the 2 businesses. We're going to split out what the SEC requires. In terms of the $550 million in OpEx, like we said, we've submitted the operations plan to MOFCOM. We're working on certain synergy proposals that are compliant with this plan and what we're going to report what these synergies are when we have finalized the plan with China's MOFCOM.", "Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And so that's your most sort of conservative take at this stage or your most realistic, the $550 million?", "John F. Coyne", "I think it's realistic for the current quarter in that we have to complete our negotiations. Also, I think Wolfgang mentioned, we are continuing to invest in emerging opportunities for hard drives and beyond hard drives. So we're continuing to actually to increase spending in certain areas of the business from an OpEx perspective.", "Operator", "Scott Craig with Bank of America.", "Scott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "2 questions. John, can you first address the TAM of 155 million to 160 million, and circle that around with the comments that you think you'll be able to meet full customer demand? Because I would have thought, given the inventories and the distributor being half the level of normal and a TAM prior to the flood level of hanging around that 170 million mark, that you wouldn't be able to meet customer demand here in the near term. And then secondly, Wolfgang, on the guidance for the June quarter from a revenue perspective, can you provide a little bit more granularity on that with maybe ASPs and units and sort of a mix, where you think that's going to be from a customer segment?", "John F. Coyne", "Right, so this is John. And my comments on the inventory versus demand, I think we'll be able to meet the true market demand. I don't think we'll do much in the way of rebuilding inventories or recreating the traditional model of where those inventories are and the timing between cutting an order and delivering the product to where it's meant to be. We're using air freight almost exclusively today. The velocity through the distribution channel is very high, and I think as the momentum builds in distribution and the volumes get back to pre-flood levels and as momentum builds back in retail, back to -- towards to pre-flood levels, I think that's the first order of business is to fuel that growth and support it. And then the second order of business, which comes later in the year or possibly early next year, is to see the inventory and distribution models revert to a more normal level of inventory and velocity of that inventory.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "And on your revenue question on the $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion, I mean, I highlighted a few elements regarding to WD's situation now being more recovered from the flood and having pricing reflective of current market conditions. John and I both commented on the multi-quarter agreements that Hitachi has put in place. We also talked about the mix in -- on the HGST side that were reflected by gaming, and all that you need to take into consideration that some volume goes away with the Toshiba divestiture that we are planning for the end of May for this guidance assumption. And overall, like we said before, overall, we're operating below market mix. Like John said, we think that we'll make this up over the next couple of quarters. But those are some of the assumptions that went into the revenue guidance.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "I guess, along those same lines, but on the gross margin line, can you give us some sense of kind of how long the Hitachi game is run for? Should we think of them through the balance of this year? And now that you guys think that sort of we're going to be moving in market pricing here for the noncontract business, should we think of the June quarter gross margin guidance as being, I guess, sort of the baseline to work from for the balance of the year and then we can use our assumptions around channel pricing and mix for the noncontract portion to sort of guide our models. Any color there will be helpful.", "John F. Coyne", "I think there's 2 elements. As always, there's 2 fundamental elements to margin. One is ASPs and the other is unit costs. And the ASPs are going to be what the market dictates they be. And on the cost side, we currently have some cost matters to our business that are a result of the floods. Some those are industry-wide and are being reflected on through into an overall step up in ASPs. But some of those are company-specific, and the company-specific ones will be addressed by a combination of addressing a growing TAM, and if we do that and execute against the opportunity, as well as we have in prior years, we should expect that we will grow with the TAM or ahead of the TAM. And that will address some of the under absorptions we have. We'll also help with the ratio of external heads to internal heads and then improve the utilization of our head component business, and consequently, improve our cost structure there. So we -- there's substantial opportunity there. Also, as a result of the floods, we, in order to focus on supporting our customer's immediate requirements and utilizing our assets and our supply base as effectively as possible, we delayed some deployment of our newer technology products, which, as we move up in our deployment of the newer technologies, as a proportion of our total shipments, again, we expect to see a substantial impact on our cost profile in that. So I'm very encouraged by when you look at the guidance and you look at our relative competitive position on margin, and then you'll see that we have substantial opportunity to improve our cost structure as we move forward for the balance of the year. I think you see that our comments in the supplementary information on March 8, where we indicated that a profile of the business, on a post-acquisition basis, being very close in terms of participation in different market segments, being very close to that of our largest competitor, that we expected that the metrics driving the business will be equally close. And so it will take us a few quarters to get there, but I'm highly confident that we have what it takes. And I think we've got a track record to demonstrate that our confidence is not misplaced.", "Operator", "Mark Moskowitz with JPMC.", "Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "John, I want to come back to your commentary about you have a series of upside opportunities. It excites the teams. Some of the research we've been doing suggests that the enterprise system OEMs are a little frustrated by one of your major competitors in terms of the pricing environment over the last few months. Are you with either with WD or Hitachi subsidies -- or excuse me, subsidiaries or both of the subsidiaries seen increment opportunities for dual and triple sourcing for these system OEMs?", "John F. Coyne", "Well, we believe we've got a tremendously strong enterprise portfolio between the 2 subsidiaries. We believe we have a marketplace that is ripe with opportunity, and we're going to pursue it vigorously.", "Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Then a follow-up, just around on CapEx, have there been any instances where Western Digital or Hitachi had to capitalize some of your Tier 1 or Tier 2 suppliers who were hurt by the flood, and how did that play out?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "That was not any big numbers there. We supported some supplies very, very early on with early payments, but it was a very immaterial.", "Operator", "Ben Reitzes with Barclays.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Can you guys just get a little more granular about ASPs? I mean when you back into the numbers, it would seem that you guys are thinking about a double-digit decrease anywhere like up to 15% sequential decrease in pricing. And I just wanted to kind of you guys to expand upon that? Just -- and then I have a follow-up.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes. We didn't imply any percentage increase. We didn't give the volume number. I think we explained what the assumptions are for the ASP that goes into our guidance.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Well, the other question I had is that prior to the flood, you guys were doing 58 million in volume and Hitachi was doing close to 30 million. What is the run rate number we should assume? And I think you -- people are assuming around 6 million drives for the desktop assets that's being sold. So what is the full capacity of the new company, the run rate kind of full demand in terms of units? And what you're able to do once we get to the September quarter?", "John F. Coyne", "I mean, I think it's fair to take in terms of capacity to assume that from a invested capital perspective, you're correct in the 58 and 30 facilitization that was in place pre-flood. You're also correct in looking at divestiture to Toshiba. Now over many, many years, I think we have demonstrated that the installed capacity is -- I mean, it's relevant in terms of the depreciation numbers. It's not relevant in terms of how we utilized that capacity. We plan capacity utilization based on our read of market requirement. And whether that is as of we are at the current moment, planning in this quarter to run less than the installed capital base would allow in order to match the demand that we perceive to be available to us profitably. We've also demonstrated in history a very good capability to scale our business upward as demand appears and to do that in a very timely manner and a very efficient manner from a dollar per incremental output perspective. So I do anticipate we'll have some drag of overall invested capital, and hence, depreciation over the next several quarters as the TAM rebuilds and as we earn our share of that TAM. And I think as we look at the longer term for the overall business, we will, in calendar '13 and beyond, be looking at deploying those previously demonstrated skills of adding judicious capacity to meet opportunity in a timely manner.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. Well -- then the final thing is just with regard to you generated a ton of free cash flow, $1.1 billion, and if you have a few more quarters like this, you're going to put away a lot of cash. Is there any additional thinking on returning cash to shareholders of the company? And that's it for me.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes. Let me first comment on the free cash flow for the last quarter, which was kind of untypical and highly related to the timing of the acquisition. The way be how you should be thinking about free cash flow, and you're right, this company has the potential to create a lot of cash. If you just take this quarter, for instance, at the midpoint of our guidance and 269 million shares, if you apply the gross margin and deduct the OpEx and then take the $350 million CapEx -- or $357 million CapEx, total amortization and depreciation excluding the intangibles that we just added somewhere to $280 million range. If you assume a constant working capital, no investments in working capital, that gives you a free cash flow around $600 million or so. So you're right, that's very substantial. We're actively looking at the cash utilization strategy. And I pointed out that's one of the topics that we're going to cover in September, and we'll update you then.", "Operator", "Scott Schmitz with Morgan Stanley.", "Scott Schmitz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Now that the industry is able to meet demand, do you have a time frame for when you think your market share normalizes kind of back to the normal levels that would have, if you consider Hitachi and WD combined?", "John F. Coyne", "The market share is about earning customers' business, and we think we're pretty good at that. We're going to try very, very hard to be good at that and continue to be good at that. And I expect that, that will be reflected in the position at the end of June quarter, which will be the first quarter of execution with both subsidiaries under Western Digital ownership. And I think that will give a baseline starting point from which excellence and execution from a technology deployment, product portfolio, service levels and value, will then drive forward from there.", "Scott Schmitz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And when you get to that kind of normalized market share level, what does pricing look like? Are we back to the pre-flood levels? Are we reset a little bit higher? Any other comments you can give on the pricing side?", "John F. Coyne", "No. I think we have indicated previously and I'll reiterate that expectation that the costs incurred by the industry, both to recover the lost capacity relative to the flood and to de-risk the business for our customers in terms of the moving the supply chain around to create a much less concentrated profile, those things have cost attached to them, and I believe that it will be affected through to the customers. So we expect that pricing in the drive industry will continue to be elevated relative to pre-flood levels. We, nevertheless -- that elevation of pricing notwithstanding, we believe that our drives still represent best value in the technology supply chain for the industries we support. And that, that value needs to be reflected in the business model of the hard drive company like ours and to return to our investors for developing and deploying technology at this level.", "Operator", "Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I just have 2 clarifications. Wolfgang, in terms of interest expense for next quarter, I don't think that you said anything. Can you give us some sense of what you expect that to be with the new debt?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Sorry, I didn't catch. Interest expense?", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "That's right around $15 million.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "$15 million, okay. And in terms of the units that your shipped this quarter, can you give us a sense of how many of the units were SAS and fibered channels, so pure enterprise versus near-line products either Western Digital and Hitachi combined or separate or whatever?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes. We're usually not breaking out that piece. We've always just give then the enterprise number.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Will you break that out in the future?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "I have no current plans, but we're thinking about it.", "Operator", "Jayson Noland with Robert W. Baird.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I wanted to come back to the retail TAM being half what it was a year ago. I assume some of that's availability, but is some of it also cloud storage?", "John F. Coyne", "No. I don't think it's cloud storage. I think it's -- when you think about the retail channel, where the price of the product on the retail shelf is dominated by the cost of the hard drive within that package. Consequently, the increases in hard drive pricing immediately post-flood, there were 2 impacts on the retail channel. One, was availability. The second was that the price increases on drives were immediately reflected in the full level of the increase to the consumer. If you look at all our other markets for hard drives, the hard drives incorporated in a larger system, where the hard drive is maybe 10%, 15%, at most 20% of the system value billing material. And consequently, the price increases in those markets had less chilling effect on purchasing behavior. So I think there's a 2-part element. The third element that affected the retail channel was that absent a clear visibility into supply, the retailers were reluctant to place ads and give prominence to the category because they were not sure that they could fulfill the demand that they would create by doing those promotional activities. So you take those 3 elements -- have contributed together. We believe the demand for personal ownership, availability, security of content and the value proposition of owning a terabyte of your own secure accessible data for less than $100 compared with renting that same capacity at 10x or 20x that cost over a reasonable expectation of lifetime of that data in the cloud, we believe the personal content ownership, both from a safety and security and keeping other people's eyes off it, as well as the value proposition, offer a compelling value. And so we believe we're going to see the retail market rebound as the constraints I outlined go away. And in fact, we see the way that the cloud enables mobility and the way that it enables people to easily generate content on mobile devices and consume content on mobile devices, all plays into a significant increase in demand for personally -- personal storage for personal content and home-based personnel network-attached storage or personal cloud storage, and we're addressing both of those markets. Now just to hedge our bets, of course, we're very strong players in the cloud market. In fact, the entire cloud would not exist, were if not for the backbone technology of performance and capacity enterprise product. So either way, we win.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And a follow-up with Wolfgang on synergies between the 2 subsidiaries, could you talk about that a little bit generically? I assume that some it could include minimizing product overlap, but not really sure what you can and can't do there with the regulator.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes. I think we'll address that once we have the operations plan finalized with China's MOFCOM.", "Operator", "Mark Miller with Noble Capital.", "Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "With a previous comment, there's been a lot of figures thrown around for the percentage of drives that are going to be divested. I think someone mentioned previously, it was 6 million. Can you give us any ballpark figure because we're hearing numbers all over the place.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes. I mean...", "Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "Is 6 million being the ballpark of the drives divested?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes. If you to -- in the FTC's website, there was actually a pretty good description of the divestiture. And from the number of lines that are being mentioned, you can conclude that it's anywhere in the 5 million to 6 million per quarter capability. And that's probably the best number for you to use that the assets that we're divesting can output in the quarter.", "Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "I attribute this more to the greater percentage of long-term agreements, but Seagate kind of stuck its neck out and said that they thought margins would stay above 30% throughout this calendar year. Are you saying pricing will stay up? Can you go any further on that?", "John F. Coyne", "Well, I can't talk to Seagate's margins, but what I can tell you is we have substantial opportunity on the cost side of our business to enhance our margins, and we will compete in the marketplace to provide value to our customers on a consistent and continuing basis. And now we believe that's what we've done profitably for 10 years, and hopefully, we'll continue to do it profitably for at least another 10 and beyond.", "So thank you, all for joining us today. As I hope you can tell, we're very excited about the growth opportunities in the data storage industry and about the new WD's ability to participate in this market as a leader in the years ahead. I look forward to updating you on our progress.", "Operator", "Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call.

Welcome to Western Digital's Fourth Quarter Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2012. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "Now I will turn the call over to your host, Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.", "Bob Blair", "Thank you. I want to mention that we will be making forward-looking statements on our comments and in response to your questions today concerning growth in the storage industry, hard-drive demand from the September quarter and fiscal '13 and our financial results expectations for the September quarter and fiscal '13. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 9, 2012. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events.", "In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the investor information summary posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "The forward-looking guidance we provide during this call excludes certain items such as amortization of intangibles and the diluted impact of sales of drives to Toshiba in connection with our divestiture transaction. Because the amount of these items is not fully known to us at this time, we are unable to provide guidance for or a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures. [Operator Instructions] I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investors section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of this call.", "I'll now turn the call over to Western Digital's Chief Executive Officer, John Coyne.", "John F. Coyne", "Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. With me are President, Steve Milligan; and Chief Financial Officer, Wolfgang Nickl.", "To begin, I want to thank all our employees for their extraordinary achievements in one of the most challenging and exciting years in our 42-year history. While responding to 2 major natural disasters and completing the largest acquisition in the history of the industry, we achieved revenue growth of over 31% and more than doubled earnings.", "Turning to the market. June quarter demand was in line with our forecast of late April. Industry shipments reached 157 million units, bringing total hard drive shipments for the year to 599 million units. Our WD and HGST teams both performed ahead of plan in Q4, with consistent execution, delighting customers with compelling and high-quality products and flexible service. As a result, we delivered strong revenue, gross margin and cash flows.", "In formulating our outlook for fiscal 2013, which we will share with you today, we considered many factors: We took into account several broad trends such as the soft macroeconomic environment, the growing use of tablets and smartphones and a modest expectation for the initial acceptance of Windows 8 and Ultrabooks. Consequently, our planning assumption for unit growth and hard-drive demand is a 5%.", "We considered several Western Digital specific factors: First, due to the regulatory requirements to operate WD and HGST as separate subsidiaries for at least 2 years, we do not expect any significant OpEx synergies in that timeframe; second, our experience since completing the HGST acquisition has demonstrated customers' continued appreciation of the respective strengths of our WD and HGST subsidiaries; third, following 4 months of experience, we have confirmed the robustness and predictability of HGST's business operations, processes and controls; fourth, each subsidiary has multiple opportunities to further improve its cost structure, by ramping newer areal density platforms throughout the fiscal year and by making continued progress on cost optimization and the recovery from flood-related cost issues.", "Taking all this into account, we believe that Western Digital can deliver non-GAAP earnings per share of $10 in fiscal '13.", "Storage continues to be at the center of the evolving digital universe: In entertainment, education, commerce and communication. WD and HGST continue to focus on serving this market with a broad and expanding portfolio of products. We believe a strategy of delighting customers, focusing investments in faster growing market segments and driving strong execution in both internal operations and our supply chain will continue to deliver consistent and superior financial performance.", "Steve Milligan will now cover the operational highlights of our Q4 performance. Steve?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Thanks, John. When we announced the acquisition of HGST in March 2011, we emphasized the potential for strong financial returns. We believe the consolidated June quarter financial results provide a compelling early proof point.", "Both WD and HGST have a heritage of developing strategic and collaborative customer relationships, underpinned by innovative products, great technology and consistent execution. We are very pleased with the momentum we have maintained in the marketplace as we continue to focus on helping our customers succeed by developing and delivering great products across all segments of our business.", "We delivered strong financial performance in the June quarter, with consolidated revenue of $4.8  billion. Crisp execution and healthy profitability generated strong cash flows. Our subsidiaries also independently managed their build plans to the prevailing demand environment.", "We shipped a total of 71 million units or 48 million terabytes of storage into the market in the June quarter. The segment mix of the consolidated results for the 2 subsidiaries demonstrates a very healthy balance. In total, Western Digital shipped 7.9 million hard drives into the enterprise market; 54 million hard drives into the client space, including notebook and desktop; 4.2 million hard drives into the consumer electronics segment, including DVR, gaming and automotive applications; and 5 million hard drives for branded products. We also shipped 1 million non-HDD units including solid state drives, media players and routers.", "It is worth noting that our aggregate shipments of nearly 8 million hard drives to enterprise customers demonstrates continued momentum by both HGST and WD in this highly strategic space.", "As expected, WD's industry-leading branded products business rebounded in the June quarter from its post-flood downturn with exciting new products.", "On the operations front, WD began production in its new slider fabrication facility in Malaysia, and both subsidiaries improved efficiencies and reduced cost from flood-induced levels.", "It is also important to note that both WD and HGST continue to invest in new product development. During the fourth quarter, several innovations were delivered to customers including some important new market entries:  Specifically, the WD branded products group advanced its connected home strategy with entry into the wireless home networking business, launching its family of My Net routers. It also added new software and services, including the WD 2go personal cloud mobile app with Dropbox integration.", "On the component side, WD introduced its WD Red series, the industry's first hard drives specifically designed for home and small office NAS systems.", "To address demand for thin and light devices, HGST continued to leverage its first-mover advantage with its 2.5-inch, 7-millimeter drives. More than 46 million of these particular drives have shipped since product inception.", "Continuing its leadership position in enterprise storage, HGST demonstrated the industry's first 12 gigabit per second SAS solid state drive.", "In a departure from Western Digital's long-standing tradition of announcing new products only as they ship, we plan on providing a preview of some exciting innovations at our Investor Day on September 13th. I look forward to seeing many of you at that time.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Wolfgang for his financial reports.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Thank you, Steve. I will first summarize our consolidated financial performance for last quarter and will then provide a range of expected financial results for the September quarter.", "The revenue for the June quarter was $4.8 billion. We shipped a total of 71 million hard drives into the market at an average selling price of $65. Both unit volume and average selling price exceeded the expectations that were implied in our guidance.", "OEM sales represented 69% of revenue, distribution channel sales were 21% and retail sales were 10%.", "Our gross margin for the quarter was 31%. This includes $39 million of amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets. Excluding this, non-GAAP gross margin was 31.8%. Non-GAAP gross margin came in better than the implied gross margin in our guidance due to lower-than-expected price declines and better-than-expected shipment linearity.", "R&D and SG&A spending totaled $584 million for the June quarter. SG&A included $12 million of amortization expense related to intangibles recorded through the purchase price allocation. Incremental OpEx versus our guidance reflect higher attainments on our variable compensation program.", "In order to better align our production with anticipated market demand, we took certain resizing actions that resulted in $80 million of restructuring charges in the June quarter, consisting of $72 million related to fixed assets and $8 million for severance.", "Net interest and other non-operating expense was $7 million. This includes $4 million of gains on  investments.", "Tax expense for the June quarter was $56 million or 7% of pretax income.", "Our net income for the June quarter totaled $745 million or $2.87 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $872 million or $3.35 per share.", "Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations during the June quarter and our free cash flow totaled $804 million, reflecting better-than-expected profitability, solid shipment linearity, a reduction in inventory and reduced capital expenditures.", "Our conversion cycle was a positive 2 days. This consisted of 45 days of receivables, 34 days of inventory, or 11 turns, and 77 days payables.", "Capital spending and depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $324 million and $339 million, respectively. Capital expenditure for fiscal '12 totaled $717 million. Depreciation and amortization for fiscal '12 totaled $825 million.", "During the June quarter, we made a scheduled $58 million principal payment on our term loan and also repaid the $500 million line of credit that was drawn during the HGST acquisition. In addition, we used $604 million to repurchase 16.4 million shares.", "As announced in May, our Board approved an increase of $1.5 billion in our stock purchase authorization. As of the end of last quarter, $1.3 billion remained available for future purchases.", "We exited fiscal Q4 with total cash and cash equivalent of $3.2 billion of which $1.5 billion was in the U.S. Subtracting our total debt of $2.2 billion dollars results in a net cash balance of $1 billion.", "I will now provide our guidance for the September quarter: We expect TAM to be flat with the prior quarter; revenue to be in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion; gross margin to be 30%, excluding the amortization of intangibles and a 50 basis point dilutive impact of sales of drive to Toshiba; R&D and SG&A spending to be approximately $550 million, excluding the amortization of intangibles, as we continue to operate HGST and WD as independent subsidiaries; a tax rate of approximately 8.5%; and a share count of approximately 253 million.", "Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $2.45 and $2.55 for the September quarter.", "Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "First question. As we think about the $10 number that you're now throwing around out there and you talk about the lack of synergies due to the MOFCOM regulatory requirements, relative to your $550 million OpEx guide that you've laid out, can you help us understand what that $10 number reflects as far as how we should think about the OpEx without any synergies in the model? Put another way, is $550 million the high watermark, is that how we should model kind of quarterly OpEx to get to that $10 number?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Aaron, let me give you a bit more context and summarize what we said. The base assumption is a market that's growing approximately 5% from a unit volume perspective. We anticipate our share to be roughly flat in the fiscal year. From an OpEx perspective, like John and I mentioned, we do not expect synergies when compared with the current level of OpEx, might be up or down a little bit. But in average, you should assume what we guided for in Q1. As it relates to the tax rate, I think the 8.5% that we gave you for Q1 is probably a good proxy for the year as well. We're planning to change our approach to share repurchases, where we did more opportunistic share repurchases in the past, we are now switching over to more systematic share purchases. And when you compute all these numbers together, you're coming to a gross margin that's roughly about 30%, give or take. So those are the major assumptions. But from an OpEx perspective, you should assume the OpEx to be roughly flat with what we guided for.", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And then as a follow up, if my math is correct, it looks like you guys were averaged blended capacity per drive of roughly 150 gigabytes. Can you talk about that relative to where that compares to the overall industry. Are you back to normal or is there a little bit more to come as far as returning back to a normal industry average capacity per drive perspective?", "John F. Coyne", "Well, the number was actually 681.", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I'm sorry, my math's wrong.", "John F. Coyne", "Okay. And that is pretty much back into industry mix.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "In terms of just understanding then your ability to produce using your own heads, John, are you where you want to be internally or do you think that it will be a couple more quarters? You said, you brought the Malaysian facility online, but is it back to where you want in terms of an internal versus external mix?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "I think -- Rich, I'll take that. This is Steve. But I think that -- we've obviously got different fosters, if you want to call it that, depending upon which subsidiary you're talking about. HGST has filed with a model of whether it will be 80%, 90% internal, 10%, 20% external purchases. WD has got kind of a similar model.  Obviously, that became overweighted in terms of the recovery from the flood. And as John and Wolfgang alluded to, we've still got a variety of different things that we need to do as an organization to get to pre-flood kind of levels from a cost perspective. And certainly returning to that kind of blend will be something that we'll be looking to do as we progress into the future.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just, Wolfgang, in terms of the Toshiba comment about the drag on gross margins, can you just elaborate a little bit more on how that works. Are you not allowed to get a margin like a contract manufacturer would on the drives or why would there be a drag per se?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, you're right, Rich. There is, for a certain period of time, certainty this quarter, a little bit what's included in the last quarter as well and then probably the December, March quarter, as well as we transition the 3.5-inch equipment over to Toshiba, we are building drives for them on a contract manufacturer margin basis and that is dilutive on, as I said, in the quarter. We just ended at about 50 basis points.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "But the units are included in your total unit number or no?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "No.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "No. Because we don't want to double count them with Toshiba, right? As they ship them through.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "And then just lastly, relative to all the noise that was kind of going on in the channel, you said -- or going on the sell side about the channel, you said that your shipments were actually linear to the quarter. Can you just talk about what you saw in the channel and was there really 30% plus week-on-week inventory changes? Can you just talk about what was really going on in the channel in June.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes, we don't recognize any of those numbers, and in fact, our channel inventories continue to be below 4-week level.", "Operator", "Keith Bachman with Bank of Montr\u00e9al.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Just a clarification and a question. Did you say that Toshiba was coming out of the gross margins, the 30% guidance that was excluded?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "That's correct. In a different number of the Toshiba effect is included.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Then my question is when you think about your guidance for $10, you indicated that your share is roughly flat. So I wanted to just hear your reaction to some of the comments Toshiba's made and specifically indicating that it wants to grow its share and is willing to invest both directly and indirectly. How do we reconcile those statements, because I assume that Seagate is going to want to keep its share. How do we reconcile those statements?", "John F. Coyne", "This is John. Market share is a reflection of the extent of how we delight our customers on a consistent and continuous basis. We earn market share on a daily basis as we execute a strength, long-term strength, of WD and an exhibited strength of HGST in the past several years has been providing the right products in the right way at the right time with the right value proposition to customers. And we believe we can continue to earn that share of business in a competitive marketplace throughout the upcoming year and we're modeling our business on that basis.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Well, I'll ask one last one then I'll certainly yield the floor. In terms of the unit growth -- thanks for that perspective on guidance. Is there any calibration point that you could offer on what you think general pricing trends will be over that same period? And that's it for me.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "I think that pricing is always one of the more difficult variables to predict in our business. And so we're going to continue to expect it to be, I'll call it, a competitive business. But I think that what -- there's a recognition from our standpoint when we look at pricing that, as John alluded to, there are a number of different factors that are impacting demand. One of the things that is not impacting demand, from our perspective, is the level of disk drive pricing, right? And there's arguably no reason to go and just transfer dollars to not create any elasticity. Right? And so we'll continue to provide the appropriate value to our customers, which includes, yes, you have to make adjustments in your pricing, but we're going to do that in a prudent fashion that ultimately allows for value creation not only from our perspective but also value creation for our customers.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Technology Insights Research.", "Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC", "I have 2 questions. One, can you first review what the shipments were for the industry segments? And I have a follow-on question. Not for WD specifically.", "John F. Coyne", "You're looking for total industry, yes.", "Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC", "Yes.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Wolfgang is digging it out.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "I can give you a flavor there, it was a total of 157 million units, as John said. We're about 82 million, 2.5-inch drive; 65 million, 3.5-inch drives; ATA that were about 17 -- they were about 9 million performance enterprise drives and then there were a few 1.8-inch that were shipped.", "Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC", "Okay. So given the performance of the nearline drives and the performance of the client drives, can you talk about what your understanding is of the potential for a cannibalization of, say, a tablet without a hard drive to be transferred into a nearline cloud drive. Is there an application? Is there a one-to-one transfer? Is it a little bit less than that? Can you discuss that?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "I'm not quite sure I follow your question. Can you kind of clarify that a bit?", "Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC", "Yes. Essentially, when a client drive is speced with a solid state drive instead of a hard drive. Do you see any sort of data that indicates that, that hard drive that has been displaced with a much lower capacity solid state drive that, that capacity is being transferred into a cloud-based drive given the industry data that you're seeing here.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Well, I mean, that's a hard question to answer in a real simple way. I mean, I think what we're undoubtedly seeing across the industry and its not just call it \"the hard drive industry,\" but we continue to see a tremendous amount of growth in data, right? For a variety of different reasons. And what we're seeing is a proliferation, which, by the way, there's always been a proliferation of storage devices that are used to store that increase in data, right? And so, undoubtedly, a large amount of data growth is going on in the cloud, right? No doubt about that. And we, we being Western Digital, as well as our separate subsidiaries, WD and HGST, are very well-positioned to take advantage of that in a number of different ways, whether it be the, on the HGST side, in terms of the tiering types of drives that we have, enterprise class, SSD on the front, traditional performance drives in the middle and fat drives on the back end. And then on the client side, yes, you're seeing some level of increased participation with solid state drives. But, by the way, that increased participation in pure SSD drives is not outside of our expectations, right? What we are saying, which is certainly benefiting our business, is an increased trend in terms of thin and light hard drives. So we talked about the 7-millimeter drives that, right now, both the WD sub and HGST sub have, that's being coupled up in some cases with solid-state, a dual drive configuration, that is allowing for the performance improvements or benefits that you get instant on whatever it might happen to be, coupled with the storage and cost benefit of a hard drive. And so it's a little bit difficult to answer your question in a direct fashion, but I think that the point is, is that all of this data growth is a good thing for all of us, and that what we've got to do is continue to provide the right level of innovation, the right level of products, interact with our customers in the right way, to continue to bring different solutions that address all these different applications. And so, it's actually, I think we're very optimistic in terms of our ability to be able to do that.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Steve, nice to have you on an earnings call again. I wanted to ask about the MOFCOM details that you talked about last quarter. I think you had hoped to get some concessions from MOFCOM in terms of pieces of the business that you could combine versus pieces of the business you obviously couldn't combine over the next couple of years. Could you give us an update on any progress you've made there.", "John F. Coyne", "Our conclusion that we will continue to operate the businesses as separate subsidiaries at least through the 2-year initial remedy requirement under MOFCOM and our expectation that we will not achieve measurable synergies in the OpEx environment, that gives you an update on where we are in clarification of the understanding between ourselves and MOFCOM as to how we will operate during the 2-year restriction period.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then now that we're seeing some additional revenue coming from other segments like SSD and you've also mentioned the Toshiba business, which will be in for a couple of quarters, will you be breaking out a non-HDD revenue number? Did you give that this quarter and will you be giving that going forward?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "We haven't decided yet. We're not spelling it out for this quarter beyond what Steve mentioned that it was a 1 million unit in shipments.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Hopefully, well, because we want it to be big enough so that we'll have to.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "This seems like it's impacting the ASP [ph] a little bit in terms of the calculation. So it will be helpful.", "Operator", "Next question we have from Mark Miller with Noble Financial Capital Markets.", "Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "I wonder if Steve could refresh our memory in terms of what enterprise shipments were by HGST in the year-ago period.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "You know, Mark, I honestly don't know. And so I don't have the specific number in front of me. But I can tell you and we've been very fortunate with, and I'm speaking now in the HGST side of being able to meaningfully improve our market position in the enterprise base, both in terms of traditional performance enterprise, as well as capacity enterprise and certainly something that we're very pleased with. And we want to maintain that position. We want to improve that position. We want to continue to deepen our relationships from the customer perspective. And so I apologize for not having that specific number in front of me. But I do know that it has improved rather markedly over the last 12 months.", "Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "Your cost of goods sold per drive unit remains high, but some of that's flood effect. And I'm just wondering how much of a upside in terms of continued strong margins, is that going to be significant next year? Are you going to be able to significantly pull those costs down?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "You're right. In the Q4 numbers that we just reported there was for both subs, but in particular for the WD sub, that was mostly impacted by the flood. There was a sort of significant cost disadvantage when compared with pre-flood levels and that has to do with absorption, that has to do with higher external content, that has to do with freight modes that we use and other things, and you should assume that it's a significant opportunity going forward and that we will walk ourselves through that over the next couple of quarters.", "Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "Certainly doesn't appear so, but your competitor announced significant component supply issues or problems, it doesn't look like you had any problem. You were able to navigate that issue, is that correct?", "John F. Coyne", "Yes, we haven't. There's always occasional this, that and the other thing, but nothing significant.", "Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "And the supply components of the channel, is that basically back to pre-flood levels or are there any bottlenecks or anything like that in the channel?", "John F. Coyne", "I think we're pretty much, both in terms of the mix and quantity of drives, that we're in a position to make available to our customers, matches their needs and the component landscape is appropriate to support both plans.", "Operator", "Next comes from Cindy Shaw with DISCERN.", "Cindy Shaw - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc", "Actually, I'd like to follow-up with more color. You did mention that there's -- it sounds like about 3 quarters worth of additional cost benefit to work off. I mean, I'm just wondering if you can give us more color in terms of things like, are you still sending things airfreight? At what point do you think you'll be back to that mix of internal versus external heads? How much of the cost increase that we have seen do you think is a more lasting effect versus how much do you think might be worked off, and even a range that you might be able to give us over the next few quarters will be great?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Like I said, I think we'll walk ourselves through everything by the end of the new fiscal year. Some of it is solvable more immediate like the freight mode and some of it like the component mix will take a little bit longer. We said we had multi-quarter agreements there. So it's a gradual improvement throughout the fiscal year.", "Cindy Shaw - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc", "And can you give us a sense for how much -- there's been discussion also that some of the cost increases will be permanent because the supply chain will be more diversified? Can you give us a sense for how much we might think about that in terms of the cost?", "John F. Coyne", "I think we've previously indicated that we expected the impact of that to be $1 to $2 a drive over the long haul in terms of that change in model for the business in terms of change in concentration model and the need to continue to invest in substantial incremental technology right throughout the supply chain as we move forward and address the challenges of delivering areal density on into the future.", "Cindy Shaw - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc", "And then can you comment in terms of getting your production back online? Are you completely requalified on everything with all your customers? Has there been any sort of shift? I know one of your suppliers was talking months ago that there's going to be a big shift in areal density in the new equipment that was brought back up and the new process was brought back up. Is there more to go there or is that pretty much behind you as you brought the new capacity back up to the level it's at?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "That's pretty much all behind us thanks.", "Operator", "Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.", "Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I wanted to see if we can go back to ASPs. Just to give us a kind of a better understanding of some of the puts and takes. Because I imagine that the blended ASP benefited from a higher mix of enterprise drives this quarter, just given the contribution of growth from a unit perspective from the enterprise. So I wanted to understand that. And then the second part to that question is really about the ASP takedowns that you kind of telegraphed during the last earnings call. Were they kind of inline with your expectations? Were they more severe or less severe, and how should we think about that going into September quarter?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Let me add a few points on that. First of all, to put the LTA that we mentioned, those are all done. There were certain short term agreements. Those are all behind us. The second thing that's important to point out and that we alluded to is that WD as a response to the -- with significant impact to the flood, had increased the prices to the highest level, and we believe in Q1 has clearly met the [indiscernible] on OEM pricing again. Last quarter, pricing actually came in better than expected. You see that with the major impact of our overachieving of the EPS. And that had to do with the differential between channel pricing and OEM pricing. In the flood, the spot markets increased much more than the OEM markets and the teams were very, very disciplined to manage shipments linearity. And like Steve said, the inventories are extremely tightly managed to sub 4 weeks and that includes in transit. But we were able to maintain that spread between the markets a bit better than we thought when we gave the guidance for the quarter. For Q1, implied in our guidance is a mix. Obviously, it includes now our position in the market and enterprise drives. It has our subsidiaries at market pricing for OEMs. And it assumes that the distribution pricing gets into the normal range to the OEM pricing.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes and Mark, this is Steve. Let me add a little bit of a perspective, which I don't mean this in a disrespectful way. But I've been away from the earnings kind of stuff a little bit, but I think it's important that we -- one of the things generally technology prices come down over time, right? And so we are going to have a price declines and it's important. And we have to remind ourselves in terms of how we manage the business to do the same that you not become overly fixated on one particular data point or element of our business. And so we deal with price declines all the time. The question is rate and pace. And then the other thing is that, what we do need to deal with that? How do we manage our cost? How do we manage our mix? How do we introduce new products? How do we find other ways to add values to our customer? And at the end of the day, ultimately, it's our job to figure out how to factor that all in and deliver not only satisfactory products to our customers but a compelling return to our shareholders.", "Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And my other question here is around Apple investments. Wolfgang, has there been any change in terms of the CapEx strategy as you go into fiscal 2013?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, a few points there. First of all, you might have noticed that we came in a bit below what we said in the March quarter. We said 7 -- sorry, what we said in the May call. We said we'll be about 750. We came out at 717. We do also expect that we will not spend the full recovery capital that we indicated of 650 now because obviously, we're not bringing the capacity back to the same level. We earmarked that number at about $400 million as opposed to the $650 million. And for fiscal '13, our capital expenditure number will largely depend on what -- towards the end of the fiscal year, we expect the demand to be for [indiscernible] . But in general, you should assume that our capital spending for the fiscal year will be below the 7% to 8% that we guided to historically.", "Operator", "Next comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "Wolfgang, was just wondering you made mention on the call the aerial density ramps in coming quarters. I was wondering if you could comment on that. And, along with that, can you give us an update on when we should expect the ramp of single platter drives and where you are with that now? And anything else on the mix perspective that might service that tailwind to the gross margins going forward.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes. So let me take that question. So from a technology perspective, there's a few kind of key  things that we're really focused on. The first thing is, and you alluded to it, is ramping to more competitive levels or cost competitive levels. The new areal density points whether that's a 500-gigabyte per platter on a 2.5-inch platform and then a terabyte for a 3.5-inch. And so our development teams, our respective development teams, are aggressively working on that ramp and we'll continue to see that transition. I mean, it is already actively in process, but we'll continue to see that occur over the course of this fiscal year. And then the maturity benefits of that from a cost perspective as we improve yields, et cetera. And so that's obviously a key area that we're focused on. The other thing is that, and we've already sort of alluded to this, but we want to continue to make sure that were investing from a product perspective on the opportunities that we see in terms of thin and light applications, whether that be in Ultrabooks or it be in Slimbooks, whatever you want to call them, where we think that we have the ability to continue to package drives in an effective way that allows us to ship into thinner devices. And then additionally, we want to continue the progress that we've made on the enterprise front. And so we're going to continue to invest meaningful dollars in expanding and improving our product portfolio in both subsidiaries so that we can continue to -- and to maintain our momentum, shall we say, in the enterprise area. And then, of course, lastly, is that we'll continue to invest in advanced areal density technologies whether that be shingle write or heat assist or energy assist, whatever you prefer calling. So those are really our priorities from a technology perspective.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "That's helpful. And I guess the follow-up is, Wolfgang, I think the word you used or the context you used on buyback that you would you move to be more methodical as opposed to opportunistic? And with the stock word in that, can you give us some sense of how opportunistic you may be willing to be versus methodical or what really we should take away from methodical?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Let me just say this. I mean, we got a significant increase in authorization. We took the opportunity to buy shares last quarter. We will be more systematic rather than opportunistic. We'll talk more to you at our September meeting about the exact details of the capital allocation strategy and I will leave at that for now.", "John F. Coyne", "And thank you all for your participation in today's call. I'm very pleased with Western Digital's performance in fiscal '12, extending our 10-year record of compound annual revenue and EPS growth, the 19% and 48%, respectively. I'm excited to have such a strong and accomplished leadership team focused on the strategic development of our business to extend this long-term performance into the years ahead. And look forward to sharing our strategy and introducing the leadership to you at our upcoming Investor Day here in Southern California on September 13. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.

I would like to take this opportunity to let you know that we plan to hold our fourth quarter results conference call on Wednesday, January 23, 2013, and we are planning our 2013 Analyst Day for May 8. With that, I will turn the call over to Sanjay.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report strong third quarter performance that underscores progress in many elements of our business. We delivered healthy sequential revenue growth in the third quarter, driven primarily by the company in our mobile embedded business within OEM. In addition, our retail revenue grew both sequentially and year-over-year, as we gained share across all major geographies worldwide. Our gross margins expanded sequentially through excellent improvements in product costs, combined with an improved pricing environment. In the OEM channel, we successfully ramped high-volume production of a customized solution for the leading OEM customer, and this product contributed significantly to the strong growth of our embedded mobile business during the third quarter. Additionally, our iNAND MCP and iNAND discrete products revenues grew from the second quarter and our next-generation high-performance iNAND solutions have been qualified in 13 mobile OEM platforms, and have now begun production ramps. For the fourth quarter, we expect continued growth in all of our mobile embedded offerings. We remain focused on advancing our iNAND roadmap to address specifications required for new, higher performance and more powerful mobile product platforms expected to launch during the course of 2013. In SSDs, our clients' products performed well with continuing revenue growth in both OEM and retail channels. Our position in the Client OEM Storage segment continues to improve, with the example being our X100 design win at Lenovo in their ThinkPad X1 Carbon Ultrabook. Our unique SanDisk iSSD solution and U100 SSD, in conjunction with ExpressCache dual-drive caching software from our conducive partnership, continue to do well in the caching segment. In addition, we began sales of the SanDisk ReadyCache SSD caching solution in the retail channel and this represents a new retail product category for SanDisk, and an incremental growth driver for our client SSD business. Our engagement with the leading PC OEMs is strong, with several new programs scheduled for high-volume shipments beginning in the fourth quarter. Our Enterprise SSD revenue declined sequentially, impacted by delayed experience in qualification of 13 new models of our enterprise SSDs, which utilize captive flash memory. The engineering solutions required for these products have been implemented and qualifications with our customers are in progress and proceeding well. In the fourth quarter, we expect to have strong sequential growth in our Enterprise SSD sales, including web usage of our captive flash memory. Our enterprise product roadmap is well-positioned to benefit from the expected demand growth coming from servers and storage area networks in data centers, cloud storage and acceleration of enterprise applications. Our next-generation controller and product development efforts, which are key to our long-term Enterprise SSD growth, are proceeding well. At the recent Intel Developer Forum, for example, we presented our first-generation non-volatile memory express, PCIe SSD in a 2.5-inch form factor. We are also engaged in the development of the SCSI Express, another industry standard for enterprise storage. These standards aim to broaden the adoption of SSDs using the PCIe interface. Initial response to our NBME solution has been very positive, and we expect the overall PCIe market to become a key growth driver for our enterprise-based SSDs in 2013 and beyond. To close my comments on SSDs, we are making progress in penetrating this market and expanding our product roadmap, and we expect strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter in both client and enterprise SSDs, with full year combined SSD sales expected to be more than 10% of our 2012 revenue. From a software perspective, the launch of the FlashSoft or VMware product at the VMWorld 2012 conference was very successful. Several customers are already evaluating our solution in their production environments. Our second software acquisition this year, Schooner Information Technology, is making good progress and it has been integrated well within our enterprise team. The Schooner team is focused on enhancing its Flash optimizing middleware layer, the flash data fabric. Our FlashSoft and Schooner software offerings are designed to deepen our vertical integration reach and uniquely position us to provide our customers with leading-edge Enterprise SSD products and complete I/O and application acceleration software solutions. Our retail products performed very well in the third quarter, driven by a strong back-to-school season in the developed markets, and continued penetration in emerging regions. We gained share in most geographies, enabled by the strength of the SanDisk brands and our diversified product portfolio. Our average retail capacity grew at a healthy rate across all geographies, growing to nearly 10 gigabytes per unit. In addition, we are pleased with our expanding presence in the E-tail channels internationally. We continue to invest in our retail product lines, which remain a competitive differentiator for us and a strong contributor to our margins. Turning to fab manufacturing and technology, the ramp of our 19-nanometer technology progressed well, and it accounted for nearly 2/3 of our captive supply in the third quarter. 1Y nanometer NAND technology development activity is on track to begin production in mid-2013. We are continuing our efforts to scale NAND further to the 1Z generation. In terms of future technologies, mixed NAND and 3D resistive RAM, related research and development is progressing well. We continue to believe that this NAND or any other 3D NAND is 2 to 3 years away from the start of any meaningful production ramp in the industry. We also believe that 3D Z NAND [ph] will not start production until sometime beyond 2015, given its need for EUV lithography, which is still in development phase. We believe NAND will continue to be the dominant Non-Volatile Memory technology in production through this decade, given its large installed base of production capacity and growing applicability. From an industry perspective, based on third-party analyst reports regarding NAND Flash manufacturers' respective capacity and technology status, we now estimate 2012 industry-based supply growth to be approximately 60%, down from our previous estimate of approximately 70%. And for SanDisk, our 2012 captive supply rate growth is approximately 80%. For 2013, we now expect industry supply-based growth rate will be in the 30% to 40% range, lower than the 40% to 50% range we estimated back in July. This, coupled with the expected strength in demand trends, bodes well for healthy flash industry fundamentals in 2013. As we look at our own captive supply base, and given the efficiencies achieved with our technology transition so far, we have not yet made a decision as to when we will resume the ramp of Phase I of Fab 5. And the earliest timeframe for production ramp would be the second quarter of 2013. However, we do expect to substantially complete Phase I expansion in 2013. We expect our 2013 captive supply base growth to be around the low end of the industry range. Factors influencing our bit supply growth in 2013 will include greater X2 mix, a continuing long tail of production of 24-nanometer to support our growing OEM customer requirements for embedded and SSD products and the timing of restarting Phase I Fab 5 expansion. We remain focused on carefully managing demand and supply balance for our customers, prudently planning for wafer capacity additions and also on strengthening the mix of our product sales. In summary, our third quarter performance reflects our strengthening business fundamentals. In the near-term, we believe we are positioned well for the upcoming holiday season in retail. We have started to regain traction with our mobile embedded products in OEM, and we expect strong growth in our SSD sales in the fourth quarter. The demand drivers and fundamentals for NAND Flash are strong, and we are excited about the growth prospects for SanDisk in 2013 and beyond. I look forward to providing you with our fourth quarter results and 2013 outlook early next year. With that, I will turn the call over to Judy for her financial review.", "Judy Bruner", "Thank you, Sanjay. We are pleased with the sequential improvement in our business this quarter, and we expect continuing gains in the fourth quarter. Our third quarter petabytes sold increased 36% compared to Q2 and 76% year-over-year, with strong petabyte growth in both our OEM and retail channels. With an improved industry supply-demand balance, our sequential rate of price declines subsided to 8% compared to 18% in the second quarter, whereas our year-over-year ASP per gigabyte decline remains high at 49%, reflecting the steep price decline in the first half of the year. The mix of our third quarter products revenue was 41% retail and 59% OEM. In the retail channel, our revenue grew 15% sequentially and 5% year-over-year, and we experienced solid sequential growth in all major product categories. USB sales did very well for the back-to-school season. Our imaging card sales reflected strong growth in high-performance cards where we are gaining share, and our mobile phone card sales grew sequentially and year-over-year. Geographically, our retail revenue increased sequentially in all major regions, whereas year-over-year the growth came primarily from emerging markets. Revenue in our OEM channel grew 33% sequentially and declined 19% year-over-year. Embedded products for the mobile market drove the sequential OEM revenue growth and embedded sales were also up year-over-year. The year-over-year decline in our OEM revenue was primarily the result of mobile card debundling and secondarily, the steep year-over-year price decline. Our OEM mobile card sales were stable on a sequential basis. Our OEM SSD sales more than doubled year-over-year, but experienced a modest decline sequentially due to delays with certain Enterprise SSD products, as Sanjay mentioned. Our license and royalty revenue was down 3% year-over-year due to the market decline in card sales on which we receive royalties, whereas sequentially, our license and royalty revenue increased 5%.", "Turning to gross margin, our total non-GAAP gross margin improved sequentially to 31%, as third quarter cost decline exceeded price decline. Our cost per gigabyte improved 13% sequentially and 37% year-over-year, with the cost improvement driven by increased 19-nanometer mix and fab-related cost improvements. Non-captive memory usage remained in the low single-digits as a percentage of our mix and the yen rate in our cost of sales was approximately 79%, similar to last quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the appreciation of the yen had a negative impact on gross margins of approximately 1.5 points. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased sequentially by $6 million to $230 million, with the increase primarily in sales and marketing investments related to our enterprise go-to-market capabilities and retail branding and merchandising. Our 2012 non-GAAP tax rate has increased from 30% to 32%, as a result of a mix change in our profits by geographic jurisdiction. The third quarter tax provision includes a year-to-date catch-up to the higher rate, with the impact of the catch-up offset by certain favorable discrete items. On the balance sheet, cash and short and long-term marketable securities increased by $151 million, and ended the quarter at $5.4 billion on a gross basis and $3.5 billion, net of debt at the maturity value. Cash flow from operations in Q3 was a positive $128 million. Inventory at the end of Q3 remained approximately flat in dollar terms, but has come down in terms of weeks of supply and is now at the higher end of a normal range. The fab joint ventures returned cash to SanDisk of $146 million and we spent $142 million on nonfab CapEx, which included approximately $113 million of production equipment, and approximately $18 million of facility-related spending. We also spent $37 million on share repurchases. Joint venture equipment investments for the benefit of SanDisk have been approximately $435 million year-to-date, and our share of joint venture equipment lease guarantees stood at $999 million at the end of the third quarter. I'll now turn to forward-looking commentary. We expect our fourth quarter revenue to benefit from continued sequential growth in mobile-embedded product sales from fourth quarter retail seasonality, strong sequential growth in SSD sales and a continued healthy industry supply-demand environment. Our fourth quarter revenue forecast is $1.5 billion, plus or minus $50 million.", "Turning to gross margins, we have now captured the majority of the cost improvements from the 19-nanometer transition, and we expect a reduced level of cost improvement in Q4. At the same time, we expect a continued favorable pricing environment and we expect our Q4 cost decline to exceed price decline, allowing further improvement in gross margins. Our expected total non-GAAP gross margin for Q4 is 33%, plus or minus 2 points. We expect Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $250 million, reflecting increased investment in future technologies, SSD solutions and seasonal retail merchandising. We expect Q4 non-GAAP other income of approximately $5 million, and a Q4 non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 32%. Because of our share repurchases this year, we expect our diluted share count to end 2012 at or slightly below the level exiting 2011.", "Turning to capital investments, the fourth quarter joint venture tool purchases for the benefit of SanDisk are expected to be approximately $100 million, bringing the 2012 joint venture equipment investments to slightly below $550 million. We expect the fourth quarter fab investments to be funded by the joint ventures, with an additional return of cash from the joint ventures to SanDisk. We forecast Q4 non-fab capital investments to be approximately $200 million. This would bring our total 2012 capital investment, which includes joint venture investments and our own CapEx, to approximately $1.1 billion, below our previous estimates. Looking ahead to 2013, as Sanjay commented, we believe that the industry's bit growth in 2013 will be in the 30% to 40% range, and we expect our own bit growth to be around the low end of that range. We currently forecast that the industry will have a healthy supply-demand balance in 2013, leading to a reduced rate of price decline compared to 2012. We also believe our product mix will have a favorable impact on our blended ASP per gigabyte, further moderating our rate of price decline. These estimates for our bit growth and price decline lead us to expect solid revenue growth in 2013. In summary, we are pleased with the improvements achieved in our third quarter results, and we expect that in the fourth quarter we will deliver sequential growth in revenue, gross margin, earnings and cash flow. In addition, we believe that SanDisk is well-positioned to generate continued improvements in 2013. We will now open the call for your questions.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Sanjay. Thank you, Judy. Gwen, can you poll the floor for questions, please?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Daniel Amir with Lazard Capital Markets.", "Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "A couple of questions. First of all, with regards to your OEM business and I guess your Mobile business as well, I mean how should we be looking at that with related to your commentary of product mix being favorable for SanDisk on the ASP front next year? I mean, is this mobile-driven? Is this embedded driven? I mean, if you can give a little more commentary around that, that would be helpful. And I have one follow-up.", "Judy Bruner", "Sure, Daniel. My comment about favorable product mix for next year is really looking across all of our product lines, not just Mobile. And as an example, I would expect that we would have a favorable impact from our growing SSD sales, in particular our enterprise SSD sales. And within the mobile arena, I expect that we will see strong growth of our iNAND products, which have a favorable impact on the pricing statistic as well as on gross margin. And in addition, given that we expect tight supply next year, I would expect that we would see some continued reduction in the proportion of our revenue that goes to segments like the white label segment. And that also would have a favorable impact overall on the blended ASP per gigabyte computations since those products tend to sell at a lower average selling price. So it's really all in across our product lines and of course, we work hard to manage that mix of products.", "Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And the follow-up question, maybe to Sanjay, regarding the supply bit growth that you anticipate next year in the industry, which is 30% to 40%, I mean, at what level do you think that the industry might decide that it needs to invest more heavily in order to meet the potential demand drivers that we could see here around the mobile and SSD growth as well?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So Daniel, I will comment here on how we look at it here at SanDisk in terms of our capacity expansion plans. As we have said before, we remain very prudent in terms of adding capacity and we assess, of course, the demand requirements, as well as our technology transition progress and figure that into our estimations of end-to-end capacity. And when we look at the demand trends, certainly, we look at SSD growth, we look at growth of our embedded business next year and that bodes well for the growth of SanDisk business in 2013. In 2012, as we mentioned, our bit growth is approximately 80%, and we ended Q3 with inventory somewhat in the higher range, toward the high end of the normal range. And we are going to be using that -- this inventory in Q4. By end of the year, we expect to see nominal levels of inventory positioning us well to enter 2013. Q1 also tends to be somewhat seasonally slower quarter in certain segments of the business. So we don't think that Q1 is the timeframe to be adding capacity. The earliest we would consider that would be for Q2. But frankly there, we have time available to us, given the lead times for the equipment, we would rather use that time to look at further demand assessment, as well as further lead on our own technology migration, technology transition plans for 2013. So these are really the factors that we look at in terms of assessing our requirements for bit growth. And we really are not after adding capacity for the sake of capacity. We want a prudent revenue growth and we want to manage the profitable growth of our business.", "Operator", "We'll go next to James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Maybe just a follow-up on the capacity growth question that was just raised. Can you maybe talk about what -- how you're thinking about in terms of when you do start adding capacity, would you do that in small increments or will you do it in larger chunks, and how you're thinking about the rate at which you add when you eventually do?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So the rate at which we add capacity will certainly depend on our own assessment of demand and assessment of the bits gained through technology transitions and the status of our various technology transition plans. And then we make the decision to add capacity. Again, we'd like to point out we have not made any decisions at this point in this regard. And keep in mind that adding capacity, adds such complex technology nodes, in general, in the industry can only be done at a certain rate. It's not just about throwing CapEx at it. It takes resources to be adding capacity on a monthly basis. So usually, such a ramp of capacity is also metered by the resources and the technology complexities and of course, there are toolsets and all that, bringing those up and releasing them into production. So these are some of the factors that go into it, and we would not expect the rate of capacity growth in the industry if and when it resumes, to be any faster than what it has been in the past. Again, this, I'm talking about on a per month capacity addition basis.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then as a follow-up, can you perhaps size the percentage of revenue this quarter for your new custom embedded and MCP sales? How much of that was a percentage of sales in rough terms, and whether you expect that percentage to grow or decline in Q4?", "Judy Bruner", "What I would tell you is that our embedded revenue within our OEM channel was about 50% of the OEM revenue. And this is embedded. We do not count SSD in embedded. So embedded is really, primarily mobile-embedded, about 50% of OEM. But we're not going to break it down further in terms of the different products within that.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Could you just address whether it goes up or down in Q4?", "Judy Bruner", "I would expect that our embedded would grow in Q4.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.", "Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "It seems to me it's kind of an unusual situation, if you look at what your customers are doing in smartphones and tablets, they're charging $6 a gigabyte for upgrades for NAND, and kind of using NAND to price discriminate on some of the most important consumer products that are out there. Apple started doing that, but now most of the tablets are doing that. How do you think about them charging $6 a gigabyte, you're getting substantially less than that, and how do you kind of capture more of those dollars as you go forward? Does that help you initiate, maybe more supply discipline just thinking about how -- that potential?", "Judy Bruner", "Clearly, as we go into 2013, we currently believe that, with an industry bit growth rate in the range of 30% to 40% and with strong demand out there, that there's going to be a very healthy supply/demand environment and we expect that, that will help us gain more value for our products. And so we are optimistic about that for 2013.", "Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then on the same note, on the tablet side, do you have an expectation for whether NAND per unit is going to be rising next year, in general? Not at any one customer but across the board?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Yes, so from our estimates in the tablet category, we do fully expect to seeing average capacities increasing in the tablet arena.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Tristan Gerra with Baird.", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "For next year, you mentioned that you're going to track at the low end of the industry range in terms of bit growth, which intuitively could be, I guess contradicting the expectation that there is continued share gain. So how should I reconcile the 2 for SanDisk, with the expectation that your embedded business could continue to grow and outpace industry growth?", "Judy Bruner", "Keep in mind that our bit growth in 2012, we believe, was higher than the average industry bit growth in 2012. And we believe, in 2013, that our bit growth will be at the lower end. And I think you have to look at this over a period of time, a few years, really in order to look at market share. And over that period of time, we believe that we have maintained our bit share. But in any given period, it's going to depend on the timing of capacity addition and technology transitions for the different participants in the industry.", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay, and would you expect any meaningful change in your outsourced business over the next few quarters as a percentage?", "Judy Bruner", "I assume by outsourced, you mean non-captive disks?", "Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Correct.", "Judy Bruner", "Yes. I do not expect that we will see a significant increase in our non-captive, but we will look at the ability to utilize non-captive. Keep in mind that as our business has grown in terms of OEM mix and in areas like enterprise, it becomes difficult to utilize non-captive memory. And of course, our own captive X3 mix is quite optimal for our retail business. So there are somewhat limited ability to use non-captive in the different segments of our business, but we will look at that opportunity, assuming that we can -- that there is availability of the right mix of non-captive memory at the right price when we need it.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "I would just like to add one further comment regarding the bit growth next year. As I said before, we are really not after bit growth share. We are really after driving profitable growth and focusing on strategic growth and of course, return to our shareholders as well. So -- and we may have had bit growth capacity additions, that's what we are really focused on driving, strong mix of our revenue next year. So given that we may be on the low end of the bit growth range, we feel pretty good about our captive capacity strategy for next year.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Steven Fox with Cross Research.", "Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC", "Just one question on the SSD business. You mentioned some qualification issues on the enterprise side, but it didn't sound like it's materially slowing down the growth, and it seemed like there's been sort of a change in the outlook on the enterprise side. I was just wondering if you could just sort of talk about how your outlook for that business has changed, what the qualification issues were and how the market looks to you now, versus say, 90 days ago?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "As we indicated, the qualification issues were around requiring firmware changes in our product, as well as related to our use of our captive memory to have a certain production level screens. And these issues are behind us. The fixes have already been verified, and we are well on our way to driving revenue growth in the enterprise SSD space in the third quarter, and also starting to increase the use of our captive memory in the third quarter and going forward. I'm sorry, I said third quarter, I meant fourth quarter. We are looking at driving the enterprise SSD revenue growth, as well as increased use of captive flash memory in the fourth quarter.", "Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC", "And then just really quickly on the retail, you had some positive comments about your own retail sales for this quarter going into next quarter. How much of that is related to SanDisk specifically, versus the retail environment overall? Any comments there would be helpful.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "SanDisk brand is really doing very well globally, and we are very pleased with the brand awareness, with the brand strength and the brand premium that we are able to command in pretty much all geographies of the world. And our focus on execution, on driving our retail sales growth, leveraging our brand with a broad set of -- portfolio of products, as well as strong channel partners, are really the keys of SanDisk doing well in retail. We believe we are actually gaining share. We have gained share in Q3 in most major geographies in the world. So I believe that SanDisk is executing exceptionally well, leveraging its retail brand -- with the retail brand on the retail business front.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Jagadish Iyer with Piper Jaffray.", "Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Two questions, Sanjay. First, you talked about 3D NAND. I was wondering, one of your biggest competitors is aggressively pushing on 3D NAND for some level of pilot production in the second half of '13. I was wondering, what is the impact of the royalty streams going forward beyond 2013 into '14? What kind of IPs does SanDisk have on that? And then I have a follow-up.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So we do have IP in the area of 3D NAND. We too have been working on 3D NAND for some period of time. And of course, we do have IP in the area of 3D resistive RAM as well. We do not really get into any aspects of our IP agreements, licensing agreements with other third parties. We have, of course, confidentiality clauses in these agreements. So I cannot really get into the specifics related to any licensing aspects or royalty aspects, but what I can point out here is that SanDisk does have a strong IP position in the area of 3D memory.", "Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "I just have -- I just wanted to get a sense of whether the royalty could be impacted because of this? That was my question, really.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We expect the royalties for -- from our licensees to continue to be a function of the sales made by the licensees.", "Judy Bruner", "The sales of their flash memory revenue.", "Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. Judy, I just have a quick follow-up. You had mentioned that the bulk of the cost savings would probably be completed by Q4. So is it fair to assume that the margin expansion for next year could potentially be driven predominantly by ASPs?", "Judy Bruner", "What I said was that we expect that cost reduction next year will be somewhat less than it was this year. And there's a couple of reasons for that. One is that the length of the technologies transitions is getting longer, it's just taking longer between technology transitions. Another reason is that we are getting less cost reduction from each successive technology transition. By the way, in addition, we expect that we will have somewhat less X3 mix next year, given our product mix, and our product mix itself is moving towards products that tend to have a higher cost per gigabyte because they, for example, in SSD, has more non-memory cost in it and that causes a higher cost per gigabyte but comes with a higher price per gigabyte as well. So there are many factors that are leading us to believe our cost reduction will be less next year than it is this year which, by the way, is about 36% on a year-to-date basis through Q3. But at the same time, we look to a very favorable pricing environment next year because we expect that there is a strong supply-demand environment in the industry next year and that the price -- that product mix will also give us a further improvement in that ASP per gigabyte, meaning that further moderates our price decline that we get. So those are some of the colors in terms of cost decline and price decline. When we put those together, we believe that price decline for next year can be less than cost decline, and that we are likely to see margin expansion next year.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "One follow-up to your guidance. How should we think about ASP traction from Q3 to Q4 versus bit shipment for the product business?", "Judy Bruner", "We're expecting a favorable pricing environment in the fourth quarter, and we are expecting that, that level of price decline in the fourth quarter will be less than cost decline, but we're not giving a specific price decline forecast for the fourth quarter.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "These are -- the asked question was, that the confusion comes from the recent changes to the spot prices that suggest prices are beginning to move higher on an average basis. So and -- so why are you anticipating a blended -- why are you anticipating price decline into Q4?", "Judy Bruner", "There are certainly segments where prices are stable or even going up in some cases, and -- but we're not giving a specific overall blended price decline forecast for the fourth quarter. But we do believe that our level of price decline will be less than our level of cost decline.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Got it. And then just a quick follow-up on gross margin expansion. With the higher mix of SSD, especially on the enterprise into 2013, doesn't it make sense to focus more on an EBIT margin expansion where you can scale the SG&A, especially on the enterprise side?", "Judy Bruner", "I mean, I do expect that we will have EBIT margin expansion in 2013, because as I said a few minutes ago, I expect that we can have gross margin expansion, and we will manage our expenses carefully. I expect that we can have EBIT margin expansion next year as well. Is that answering your question?", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "But EBIT margin -- could EBIT margin expansion be higher than gross margin expansion?", "Judy Bruner", "Again, it's too early to provide specific ranges of these estimates for 2013. We, of course, will provide more color on 2013 on our January call.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "But conceptually, as SSD mix goes higher, you can better scale the SG&A. Is it thought process, does that make sense?", "Judy Bruner", "Actually, I would say that in the SSD business, particularly the enterprise SSD business, yes, gross margins could be higher, but I would say that expenses would also tend, in that business, to be higher than the traditional expense model for SanDisk. But we're not changing our model at this point in time, and we're not ready to give any specific guidance for our model for next year.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ryan Goodman with CLSA.", "Ryan Goodman - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "So another question on the supply expansion strategy. I understand you have growing demand in SSDs in some of these other markets, yet we can see the prices declining in these markets every week and there might be some elasticity kicking in, but we still really haven't seen SSDs go mainstream in the thin and light notebooks yet. And meanwhile, as has been discussed on the call, there are some major NAND customers out there that are capturing remarkable margins on the NAND volume. So I guess I'm curious how you're balancing the rising cost of expanding capacity and the need or want to grow in some of these newer markets with declining prices versus just trying to better monetize the wins you already have?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We are definitely focused on transitioning [ph] the mix of the business, increasing the mix of our client SSDs, the Enterprise SSD, as well as our Embedded Solutions such as iNAND that we have talked about. And these are the product areas that will give us, we believe, stronger margin profiles [ph]       in 2013. And as the pricing environment improves, and as our mix of the business strengthens, we believe that we will be addressing the market opportunities, and we'll be well-positioned to address the market opportunities during 2013.", "Ryan Goodman - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "Okay, and then just for a follow-on, kind of a bigger picture question here, there's been some consolidation over the past, I'd say year, maybe 1 to 2 years in the buyers of NAND. I'd be curious, how do you think that has played a role in this slowdown that we're seeing in CapEx spending in some of the market share shift and just the pricing trends overall, and how you think that will continue to play a role in those areas going forward?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "I think in terms of the bit growth, the factors there are, that's -- technologies also getting more complex. So the new technologies are taking longer to develop as well as the gigabytes that you gained from a technology transition is lessening compared to the past. And these are factors that are playing out for all players in the NAND industry. And in terms of the production capacity in the NAND industry, this year there has been no new capacity that has been put in place. That consolidation that you are referring to, that does maintain the capacity that is in the industry still out there. It's really -- it doesn't change much of the dynamic of the industry demand-supply outlook. The most important factors there are that the technologies are getting more complex and therefore, the bit gains on new technology transitions is slowing down, as well as the fact that no new capacity got added during 2012 timeframe, results in lower rate of total wafer output growth in 2013. So these are some of the key factors that are really playing a role in terms of the industry capacity growth. And of course, when we ourselves look at making decisions on adding new capacity, other factors that we look at are the future technology, the ROI on the NAND scaling or potential alternative technologies and how that would influence the capacity additions that are made at this point. So these are really some of the factors that I believe, that we look at and these are common set of issues for other industry flash suppliers as well.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Judy, first question on the guidance. So in the guidance, are you assuming bit shipment quarter-over-quarter for Q4 to be lower than Q3?", "Judy Bruner", "We really haven't given any specific bit growth guidance. We're really focused on the revenue guidance.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Then I would assume on the ASP side too, kind of like just even in the directional side, you would kind of if I play out the number. It seems like the bit shipment growth would be lower for 4Q, and 4Q is traditionally a much bigger quarter so, and I'm assuming the ASP would be directionally at least, lower decline than Q3.", "Judy Bruner", "Again, we've -- given what I believe is strong revenue guidance sequentially from Q3 to Q4 going from $1.273 billion to $1.5 billion, plus or minus $50 million, and we're not breaking out the specific mix of bit increase and the level of pricing.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "All right, fair enough. And then on the inventory side, inventory has almost stayed stable from Q3 to Q4. So I would assume that you had the strong bit growth that it draws down to nominal values, and Sanjay kind of hinted to that, that things in Q4 will come back to nominal levels?", "Judy Bruner", "I do expect that we will use quite a bit of our inventory in the fourth quarter. We did reduce our inventory in terms of weeks of supply on a forward-looking basis in Q3. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the inventory, in terms of weeks of supply, is actually at the high-end of our normal range. So it is within our normal range, but at the higher end, at the end of Q3, and we expect it will come down further in the fourth quarter.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and just the last one for me here. We have seen, and we have talked about too, that NAND cost decline is decelerating. But some of your OEM business is actually a lower margin business. So kind of what steps to do you think you are taking to ensure that we go back to historical margins, prior to present, plus kind of margins?", "Judy Bruner", "We are managing the mix of our business carefully and we have a variety of prices and margins of our different product segments. And as I think I mentioned earlier, we expect to see strong growth in the mix from some of our higher-margin business next year, such as, as an example, enterprise SSDs and also iNAND, and we expect that we will likely see some reduction in the mix of products such as white label products, which tend to have a lower pricing and lower margin. So we believe that we can manage the mix of our products to maintain a blended gross margin that is favorable for the company.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Bob Gujavarty with Deutsche Bank.", "Bobby Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Maybe if I can just look back a little bit. If I look like, about 12 months ago, we're sitting here and many of the trends we're talking about today were actually, you can argue, even better yet things deteriorated quite a bit over the next 6 months and I'm not here to point fingers about who got the forecast wrong, but can you talk about maybe how that experience from 3Q of 2011 through the first quarter 2012, how that experience -- what are you doing a little differently? Are you being a little bit more cautious on supply, do you have better realtime feeds on supply and demand? Just curious, what's kind of changed from 12 months ago.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "I think, for us, a couple of things are definitely different. One, compared to 12 months ago when we had ramped up Fab 5, which was needed to meet the capacity, the wafer output to meet the demand requirements in the second half of 2011, we have not added any new capacity since the January timeframe in 2012. So that's changed, compared to the same time, similar time a year ago, that no new wafer capacity being brought to most of the year since January timeframe versus last year, when we had added certain capacity to meet the growth requirements. And of course, it continues to emphasize the point to us, that we need to remain very prudent in terms of adding new wafer capacity. The second important factor that is different today versus what it was a year ago is that we have a broader set of embedded products. We have a stronger set of embedded product offerings which we have talked about, related to first half, such as customized Embedded Solutions as well as certain MCP products that we didn't have at that time. Now, it gives us flexibility to add, just really, complete set of opportunities in the marketplace compared to a year ago. So as we have said before, 2 is extremely important, that we do stay well positioned with our product roadmap to address the broad set of opportunities that are ever-growing for flash memory in the industry. And third aspect, that is very different compared to a year ago is really our strengthening position on the SSD front. Again, it goes towards a strengthening [ph]  Portfolio, but the industry demand for SSD, given the price volumes that have occurred in 2012, is also building up. I mean, SSDs are growing in a variety of ultrathin devices as well as enterprise applications. So overall, the demand trends in terms of the pickup in SSDs, as well as continuing growth in Embedded Solutions, is boding well for overall industry and certainly SanDisk is now well-positioned with strong set of product offerings for our diverse set of customers and channels.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.", "Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And just a couple of follow-ups here. Judy, you characterized inventory as being at the high end of that normalized range. Were you referring to on-hand inventory or on-hand plus channel inventory and how would you characterize the channel inventory environment right now?", "Judy Bruner", "I was referring to our on-hand inventory at SanDisk. With reference to channel inventory, I would tell you that the retail channel inventory for us at the end of the third quarter was about 5 weeks on a worldwide basis, and that's actually pretty lean. It's a little bit less than it was at the end of the third quarter of the prior year, and even less than 2 years ago, third quarter. So that's in good shape. And with respect to OEM channel inventory, that's in good shape as well. I don't see any issues in the OEM channel inventory.", "Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and then with respect to the fourth quarter's outlook, it sounds like you expect pretty broad-based growth across all the product groups. But can you rank the different products in terms of the rate of growth that you'd expect to see in the fourth quarter?", "Judy Bruner", "I would expect to see the highest rate of growth most likely in our SSD business in the fourth quarter. And -- then I think it's hard to predict exactly beyond that because, of course, retail tends to be strong in the fourth quarter, but we also expect to see growth in our mobile-embedded business. Strongest rate in SSD.", "Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and lastly, for you Sanjay, you mentioned in your prepared comments some initiatives that you've got in the software arena and the company did talk about good growth for 2013. When you look to 2013, does software start to contribute meaningfully to the top line? And if so, how to think about its impact to gross margins for the company?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Software in 2013 will continue to remain a very small part, really too small to call out. This is an area that will take us a while to develop in terms of revenue opportunity for the company. We are very excited about our FlashSoft and Schooner acquisitions. We believe we have really acquired leading edge competencies to address the caching solutions. As well as with the Schooner acquisition, using their technology to really build certain capabilities into our product offerings as well. So you should not expect to see much, if anything, meaningful in terms of revenue in 2013 from software opportunities. Of course, on the conducive side, with our client SSD, we are getting value through our strong offerings and, but overall, the revenue will still remain small.", "Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "So it's right way to think about software, as more of a product differentiator than an incremental revenue growth driver?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "That's absolutely right.", "Jay Iyer", "Gwen, we have time for 2 quick questions.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.", "Brian Peterson", "This is Brian Peterson in for Hans. Just one quick clarification question, on SSD side, what was the total revenue contribution this quarter, and can you remind us what the mix is between client and enterprise there?", "Judy Bruner", "We're not breaking out the mix between client and enterprise. The overall SSD revenue was less than 10% of our total revenue in the third quarter, but we expect it will be quite a bit higher than 10% in the fourth quarter, and we expect that it will be over 10% of our total revenue for the full year 2012.", "Operator", "We'll take our last question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.", "Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "For those certain customers that have both mobile and computer platforms, have you been able to drive your success in mobile with these customers to potential penetration within their computer platforms? Is this an opportunity for SanDisk? What is the company's strategy for achieving this? And when would you anticipate to see a broader design win footprint at some of these customers?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "You're asking about customers that have both mobile and computing?", "Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Right.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Certainly, being a broad, one-stop shop for flash solutions is absolutely a plus to those customers, and they do see at SanDisk, the ability to bring innovative products, leading edge product roadmap with backing of supply to be able to meet their requirements. So absolutely, we are able to really leverage our diverse set of product offerings in all applications of flash with those customers that participate in multiple aspects of the flash market.", "Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Great, and then just my follow-up question. So as you -- as we think about the price declines and the impact that it'll have on SSD and computer-related penetration next year, Sanjay, do you expect that your SSD business will probably be the fastest-growing business for SanDisk in 2013?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Yes, SSD, will be, in terms of the growth rate, will have the highest growth rate for SanDisk in 2013. Mobile and Embedded will also continue to grow very nicely for us. These are already large businesses. SSDs, in terms of percentage growth rate, it will be growing fast. And of course, we continue to do very well in retail as well.", "Jay Iyer", "Unfortunately, that's all the time we have today.

Welcome to Western Digital's First Quarter Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2013. [Operator Instructions] Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.", "Robert Blair", "Thank you. As we begin, I would like to mention that we will be making forward-looking statements on our comments and in response to your questions concerning growth in the storage industry, our position in the industry, our investment in capital allocation plans, HDD demand for the December quarter and fiscal 2013 and our financial results expectations for the September quarter and fiscal 2013. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-K filed with the SEC on August 20, 2012. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events.", "In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures that we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the investor information summary posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "The forward-looking guidance we provide during this call excludes certain items such as amortization of intangibles and the dilutive impact of sales of drives to Toshiba in connection with our divestiture transaction. Because the amount of these items is not fully known to us at this time, we are unable to provide guidance for or a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures.", "[Operator Instructions] I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investor section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of this call.", "I now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer John Coyne.", "John F. Coyne", "Thank you, Bob. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I have with me our President, Steve Milligan; and our Chief Financial Officer, Wolfgang Nickl.", "In this, my last earnings call, I'm happy to report another quarter of strong financial performance, continuing our track record of consistent execution. During my 6-year tenure as CEO, we have experienced and successfully addressed many different challenges and opportunities. Throughout, we have continued to hone our time-tested and flexible business model, delivering outstanding returns and value under varying scenarios. The results include a doubling of market share, a tripling of revenue and a fivefold increase in profits.", "I'm proud of this sustained performance by the team, and I'm confident as I pass the leadership of the company to Steve, ably supported by Tim Leyden, Mike Cordano and Wolfgang, that they will continue to build on that momentum.", "While the macroeconomic environment is dampening near-term demand, we remain confident in the continued long-term growth in the creation, storage and management of digital content. This is being seen in every aspect of our lives, and monetizing it provides a compelling long-term opportunity for the company.", "We have built strong relationships with customers in all of our markets by consistently delighting them with high-quality, reliable products based on superior technology and delivered through the industry's most efficient supply chain. We have developed a tremendously broad product portfolio, great depth and breadth in our people and technology resources and a powerful platform. Western Digital has never been better positioned to succeed as it continues to thrive on change and deliver great value to all its constituents.", "I want to take this opportunity to thank our customers, our supply partners and our investors for their support, and I especially want to thank our employees around the world who have consistently delivered such outstanding performance.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve Milligan.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Thanks, John. We are very pleased to report strong financial results for our September quarter, demonstrating our continued ability to deliver value under varying market conditions. There are several dynamics currently limiting market demand: first, global macroeconomic weakness, which is impacting overall IT spending; second, product transitions in the PC industry; and third, the continued adoption of tablets and smartphones, which is muting PC sales growth.", "These headwinds notwithstanding, the Western Digital team remains focused on creating outstanding economic value, building on our strong multiyear track record. There is a tremendous opportunity as we innovate and enable customers to store, manage and connect the massive and growing amounts of digital data in their personal and professional lives. This opportunity extends well into the future.", "Looking across our markets, the needs of customers are becoming more diverse, resulting in greater market segmentation. Computing is no longer a general purpose proposition, and that evolution plays to the strengths of Western Digital with our technology breadth, people and product portfolio.", "Currently, we are focused on 3 key initiatives to broaden our portfolio to meet the evolving needs of our customers, enabling continued value creation: first, the delivery of innovative and cost-effective storage products, including hybrid drives for thin and light mobile devices; second, a portfolio of enterprise products that fit the varying needs of the public and private cloud environments, including high-performance SSD systems and high-performance and large-capacity hard drives with the lowest total cost of ownership; third, providing easy-to-use integrated solutions for the personal cloud environment and our connected lives.", "We have received very positive customer feedback on our latest differentiated solutions to address these trends. All major PC OEMs have shown strong interest in our 5-millimeter and 7-millimeter hybrid designs as an alternative to solid-state and dual drive configurations.", "In the cloud environment, our new 7-disk high-capacity sealed drive announcement has been extremely well received, confirming the need to seek better total cost of ownership solutions for this growing market. For the Connected Life, we introduced today the My Passport Enterprise, one of the industry's first portable hard drives designed specifically for use with Microsoft's Windows To Go, enabling corporate customers to provision a fully featured Windows 8 workspace on a USB drive.", "For fiscal 2013, we remain focused on realizing the $10 EPS target established in July of this year despite a significant change in the underlying industry growth assumptions. We will continue to manage closely those aspects of our business that we control, namely delighting our customers, executing to our product roadmap, remaining diligent with regards to managing costs and expenses and strategically allocating our capital.", "Looking forward, I am very excited about the future of Western Digital. We have the people, platform, technology and financial resources to continue to invest in growth opportunities while at the same time, returning approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders.", "Wolfgang will now provide a report on our Q1 performance and our Q2 outlook.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Thank you, Steve. I will first summarize our consolidated financial performance for last quarter and then provide a range of expected financial results for the December quarter. Revenue for the September quarter was $4 billion. Excluding shipment to Toshiba under our divestiture agreement, we shifted total of 62.5 million hard drives into the market at an average selling price of $62.", "OEM sales represented 63% of revenue; distribution channel sales, 24%; and retail sales, 13%. Our gross margin for the quarter was 29.6%. Excluding $38 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST intangible assets, non-GAAP gross margin was 30.5%. Our R&D and SG&A spending totaled $575 million for the September quarter. SG&A included $11 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST intangible assets.", "In order to align our production with anticipated market demand, we incurred charges of $26 million in the September quarter. Net interest and other non-operating expense was $14 million. Tax expense for the September quarter was $59 million or 10.2% of pretax income. Our net income for the September quarter totaled $519 million or $2.06 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $594 million or $2.36 per share.", "Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $936 million in cash from operations during the September quarter, and our free cash flow totaled $554 million. We used $218 million to repurchase 5.2 million shares. As of the end of September, an authorization of $2.6 billion remains available for future repurchases.", "We declared the first dividend in company history in the amount of $0.25 per share or a total of $61 million, which we paid on October 15 to shareholders of record as of September 28.", "We exited fiscal Q1 with total cash and cash equivalent of $3.5 billion, of which $826 million was in the U.S. Subtracting our total debt of $2.1 billion, our net cash balance was $1.4 billion.", "I will now provide our guidance for the December quarter. We expect a total available market of approximately 140 million units; revenue in the range of $3.55 billion to $3.7 billion, reflecting the muted demand environment, a seasonal reduction in our gaming business and a planned reduction of our 3.5-inch contract manufacturing for Toshiba; gross margin of approximately 28%, excluding the amortization of HGST intangibles, which is within our new business model despite continued cost challenges stemming from the floods in Thailand last year. We expect R&D and SG&A spending to be approximately $525 million, excluding the amortization of HGST intangibles; a tax rate of approximately 8.5%; and a share count of approximately 248 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.65 and $1.85 for the December quarter.", "Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "First, I wanted to ask Steve about macro cyclical and secular. I know it's tough to divide that up, Steve. But if you could talk about how much of this is secular versus cyclical assuming the macro comes back or gets better next year. Just some more color there.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes. I mean, Jason, you kind of hit the nail on the head. I think that it's a difficult question to answer. I mean, we've got -- I mean, as we indicated in our prepared remarks, there's a lot of different factors at play. Clearly, the global macroeconomic environment, I mean -- and it's not just the IT industry, but there's a lot of headwinds in terms of what's happening on a global basis. Additionally, the IT segment is not immune to that. So we've seen other announcements come out that have talked about weakness in terms of overall IT spending. And then clearly, the PC industry is weak, right? And some of that is due to product transitions with Windows 8. But undoubtedly, there is an impact, as we're seeing, if you want to call it cannibalization in terms of tablets and smartphones or other kind of connected devices. And I think the important thing to really refer to is when we had our Investor Day, we talked about a longer-term growth rate in the HDD industry of 3%. When we put that together, we attempted as best as possible to estimate the impact of all these different factors. And right now, we don't see a reason to alter that 3% longer-term growth rate in terms of number of hard drives sold.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And Wolfgang, you maintained $10 for the full year. You must be assuming gross margins come up off that 28% level in the second half of the year, fiscal year?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, Jason. I mean, $10 is the target and remains the target. Our complete focus is on the items that we control or at least influence. We're focusing heavily on cost. We're focusing on OpEx and spending. We somewhat impact the share count as well and obviously try to optimize volume price mix decision. So we're focusing on what we control or influence. We have made an assumption when we originally stated the $10 target in July, I believe, yes, in July, that we assumed the TAM to increase by 5%. And if you do the math, that would be a TAM of 630 million units. And with the first 2 quarters at 139 and 140, respectively, we need a bit of an uptick in the second half of the fiscal year to continue to be able to do the target. I believe that we'll get in the 600 range. It's very doable. And like we said, we focus on the levels that we control. And it remains a target, and that's what we're shooting for.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Rob Cihra with Evercore Partners.", "Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Wondering within the product mix in the quarter, if you could give us maybe any more color both within PC but even more so, I guess, on enterprise. How much of that decline in the quarter and that you're expecting again do you think is inventory drawdown versus actual slowdown in demand? And again, maybe perhaps more so on the enterprise side given the fact that we kind of already know that PCs have been weak, but any view you have in the enterprise demand, what it's looking like?", "John F. Coyne", "Sure, Rob. In the enterprise space, there's a couple of different dynamics going on. First thing is if you go back to the floods, really a couple of different things there. First off, the enterprise segment was the one segment that was least impacted from a drive output perspective as it relates to the floods. We all -- the various different companies independently did as much as we could to protect the supply in that critical part of the market. Nevertheless, our customers, because of concerns about shortages, I would say, bought ahead from a demand perspective in order to protect themselves in that segment. Additionally, if you look at some of the impact of the LTA contracts that were out there, that also resulted in customers purchasing ahead from a supply perspective ahead of the demand. And then, sure, we have seen some slowdown in terms of end-user demand, if you want to refer to it that way. But fundamentally, the overall dynamics in the enterprise space remain positive as we're seeing substantial data growth and build-out of infrastructures from that perspective. However, in terms of the units that we shipped as an industry and we shipped as a company, we are seeing the impact of that inventory correction roll through the latest quarter. And hopefully, we'll be able to work our way through it as we finish out the year.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Steve Fox with Cross Research.", "Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC", "Just a couple of quick clarifications. Just on the $10 target, just to return to that for a second. If you're talking about potentially doing 600 million units as sort of the bogey, what would be the levers that you think you can most control, putting aside capital allocation? Would it be more on the expense side? Or would it be shipping new products sooner than maybe has been advertised, et cetera? And then secondly, is there any other mix issues that we should think of maybe over the next couple of quarters within the segments in terms of average capacity, within notebooks versus hard -- versus desktops, et cetera, as we model out?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, Steve, the biggest lever is clearly cost. And we're assuming a standard mix between the segments in our forecast.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes. I would just add to that, and I mean, certainly what we can do on the cost and expense side, it's always important to manage that in a diligent fashion. But our #1 priority is to continue to take care of our customers because if we can earn their trust and continue to earn their business, that helps provide the runway for stronger financial results for us.", "Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC", "And just real quick to clarify, in terms of any kind of excess inventories you're looking at, there's no emphasis on one type of capacity versus another? You're saying it's pretty broad based?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "I think that's a good assumption.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "So first question is sticking to the topic of the inventory, when I look at your finished goods inventory build, standing at 508 million, how do we think about that in the context of gross margin? How does that build flow through the gross margin? And how should we think about that line item in reflection of the 28% gross margin going forward? Have you -- I guess another way of putting it, have you aggressively pulled back on your production to see that finished goods inventory come down here going forward?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "I mean, first of all, the number is up a little bit, and that has to do with us resuming ocean shipment in both subs, and it also has to do that we were very, very focused on not overshipping to the market at the end of the quarter. In terms of its impact on the 28%, it has an impact in a sense that if you walk this inventory down a little bit, you build less drives in the December quarter. And one of the impacts is absorption, the fewer drives you build. And we mentioned the gaming effect, and we mentioned the Toshiba effect. And the fewer drives you build in a quarter, the more challenging it is to get to your cost objective. So from that perspective, coming in with a bit of a higher inventory makes it certainly more difficult to get to the gross margin. And it had a bit of a contribution to the quarter-over-quarter decline.", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then maybe a follow-up somewhat tied to that but more importantly looking forward. As I think about the levers in your model and we think about it from a, let's say, COGS per unit basis, you're still running about $45 COGS per unit. I know prior to Hitachi, you were running closer to the mid-30, high-30 range. How do we think about that in the context of getting back to normalized internal versus external heads? And then also, where do we stand on the aerial density transition?", "John F. Coyne", "Yes. I'm going to give a general comment to that, Aaron. I think that one of the things that -- and I certainly don't mean this in a defensive way, but one of the real optimistic parts of our numbers, we put a range out there of 27 to 32 in terms of gross margins. First thing is that you would expect that the low end of that margin model would have a higher likelihood of hitting when you're in adverse market conditions, right? So we're at 28%. And the other thing is that if you look at some of the issues that we're facing from a cost perspective and you get at the absorption issues, and not only that, we're still working to get back into a pre-flood cost level, frankly, at some level at those subs, and then you also look at the dislocation in terms of absorption, it's kind of a sub-point that as we transition out of this Toshiba contract manufacturing situation, we've got to rebalance our factories on the HGST side to do that in a more cost-effective way. You start thinking about that in the context of that 28%. It actually makes that number look a lot more -- look a lot better than what the headline might allude to.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "And in terms of the aerial density transition, we won't provide any particular numbers on that, but I can tell you, that we're on the very early stages. And as we cut over to the new aerial density, that certainly helps us achieve our target cost as well.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.", "Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I was wondering if you could give us a little more color on the competitive landscape within the enterprise side of the business, where the market share sort of settled out this quarter and how you're thinking about that in your forecast for the December quarter and for the full fiscal year.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes. So Bill, I'll take that. This is Steve. I think that we have done -- and this is really on both sides but certainly particularly on the HGST side, we have worked very hard over, frankly, several quarters to, one, fill out our product portfolio, and not only that, provide a more compelling value equation for our customers certainly in terms of the way that our products function, quality levels, et cetera, et cetera. And as a result of that, we've been fortunate enough to gain a meaningful amount of market share. And we continue to expect to maintain that level. In the past quarter, there were some puts and takes in terms of the different elements of that. We maybe lost a slight bit of share in certain segments, but we continue to get -- to not only maintain our momentum but hopefully, if we can continue to do our job, increase our momentum in that space.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Technology Insights Research.", "Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC", "For the near-line segment, can you first give us what the units were for that? And then secondly, can you try to help us separate out how the enterprise portion of the near-line demand trended, clearly that was not very positive, and how the cloud portion of near-line demand trended? And then I have a follow-up question as well.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "I'll give you the numbers. The TAM was just shy of 7 million units, which was down quarter-over-quarter. And we're not breaking out our specific details between performance and capacity enterprise shipments.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes. So if you look at it from a demand perspective, both the traditional performance segment and the capacity enterprise segment were affected by the inventory overhang that we spoke of -- that I spoke of earlier. I would say, and this is our view, that the inventory adjustment and the capacity enterprise space is behind us. And we expect some modest growth in that segment here in the calendar Q4. Now just to remind everybody, the demand in that segment, and this is maybe becoming a little bit less so than in the past, but it tends to be a little bit more project based, so it can be a little bit lumpy. But we are anticipating some modest growth here in the final quarter of the calendar year.", "Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC", "Okay. And then could you just discuss the drivers of expected sequential decline in gross margin? Is that purely mix? Or does that have something to do with the higher cost components here?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes. I'll take a crack at that, Nehal. First of all, and I think Steve mentioned it earlier, we have a range of, in our gross margin model, 27% to 32% that provides that at certain times, we have different utilizations, our different points with product transitions, et cetera. But for this quarter-over-quarter decline, it is mainly a cost issue stemming from some more under absorption. We mentioned the gaming business. We mentioned the Toshiba business. There is also some price alignment in there, some quarter-over-quarter price takedowns. But we're actually fairly happy with the fact that given the macro headwinds and the demand situation that we can be well within our business model.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montr\u00e9al.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I have 2 also. If you go back and just speak to the difference, you're guiding the 10 to be flat sequentially and revenues to be down quite materially sequentially. Could you talk about your pricing assumptions versus the mix assumptions and plus with that revenue guidance, please? And then I have a follow-up.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes. There's really 3 factors, Keith, that contribute to the revenue down. First is the gaming business, and that's a project-based business as well. And that's a couple of million units going down quarter-over-quarter. The contract manufacturing for Toshiba on the 3.5-inch divestiture really peaked last quarter, and it's quite a bit down as well. And then there are some price adjustments in the quarter-over-quarter price declines. It's really tough to put exact percentages, but you should think about it roughly 1/3, 1/3, 1/3.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Any comments on what you think like-for-like pricing will be?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "No, we don't -- we'll not spec that out.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "I think, if you want to -- I mean, Keith, I'll add a little bit of color there. I mean, we -- it continues to be a competitive marketplace, and we've asserted that for a long time. But in terms of pricing behavior, I would not characterize anything that we're seeing as anything out of balance, or here's another word, irrational.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, okay, great. My follow-up though, if I could sneak that in. I may be over my quota, but just what are the conditions that would enable the TAM to be up in the March quarter, which is implicit within the 600 number, 600-million-unit number. I'm a little surprised, and I'm not sure how we get there. Are you assuming within that a big 8 bounce, a Windows 8 bounce?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Well, I'm not sure that we know how to get there either. I mean, we're, I mean -- but I think that you'd have to see one of a few different things. One thing working in our industry's favor, potentially, is we can get some of this inventory adjustment stuff behind us. That certainly has been suppressing our TAM. And we, in terms of our company and what we're trying to do, we don't want to carry that over. We'd like to see that adjustment work its way through as soon as possible. And we don't want to push on that string. Additionally, it would be nice to see some improvement in the macroeconomic environment, whether that happens to be some certainty in -- and I mean, you guys know all of this, but we've got elections, we've got changes of government, we've got fiscal cliff, et cetera, et cetera, right, lots of different things that undoubtedly are impacting spending at a corporate and a consumer level. So I think that some clarity on those kind of activities would be helpful. And then also, it would be nice to see some excitement around Windows 8. We're actually relatively -- when I say bullish, I mean, maybe people are looking for good news, but my experience, I think it's got some excitement to it. And I think the thing that has really lacked is that we've got to create some more excitement around the products out there. And we're trying to do our best in terms of some of these hybrid designs and smaller form factor designs that maybe enable our customers to have a little bit of excitement back to the product set.", "Operator", "Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.", "Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just a follow-up on the last conversation. Just curious, any more specifics you may have around now that we're days away from the Win 8 launch, when we might see an uptick in hybrid or the thin HDD shipments with some of the new form factors that are planning to come to market.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes. So when we talked about our hybrid designs, I mean, what we're doing right now is we are providing engineering samples to our customers. And then in the first half of calendar 2013, we will be supplying call samples and gearing up for volume kind of activity the back half of 2013. So we have to watch our traction and our continued ability to execute from an engineering standpoint. And so we're still a bit far away, but so far, the response from our customers has been encouraging.", "Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And it sounds like that lines up with the second iteration of thin and light Win 8 products that we'd get after the Intel Haswell launch in the second quarter next year.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Correct, correct.", "Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then just a quick clarification. There was a big jump in CE units in the September quarter. I know gaming has come up a number of times. But can you just talk about what drove that incremental 4 million units and how much of that you would expect to give back in the next few quarters?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Well, the upside was [indiscernible] by gaming, and it's a very seasonal business. And I won't give you an exact number, but it's several million that can go up and down in a given quarter.", "Operator", "Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I just wanted to revisit the cost cutting and the reduced operating expenses. Wolfgang, I don't know if I got this number right. But I think you've guided to $525 million for operating expenses for the December quarter, which is down about $40 million. I wanted to get a sense of where you think you can take those cost actions. Is that reducing some of your R&D? Clearly, you'll have to do something in SG&A. And then just trying to get a sense of what type of percentage you expect R&D to be as a percent of sales as we move forward.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes. So let me state first, we are not cutting R&D at this point. I mean, where we're cutting costs out from the $550 million level is in discretionary spending. And we have also some of our variable pay programs that are not paying at the historical level. In terms of R&D in total, it's about 70% of our OpEx. But if you're operating right now at about 14%, 15%, you're close to 10% on R&D. Once we get in the future and our target model of 10% to 12%, it would be around 8%.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, 8%. And then thinking about investments as we move forward in terms of CapEx spending, what are your expectations for investments and adding new equipment as we move forward? It looks like we kind of peaked the CapEx here at 382 in the September quarter. I would assume that would go down. And how much capacity would you be expecting to add over the next couple of quarters?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes. I mean, first of all, I think you're right, the 382 is probably a peak. I want to remind you that we report CapEx on a cash basis, so the 382 includes flood-related spending that was actually for capital that was received in Q4. With that, before that, in total, we expect for flood recovery about $400 million, for which approximately half will be in fiscal year '13. Our spending is focused on a couple of things. We're obviously investing in technology ramp. We're investing in process improvements and product transitions, and we're also investing in security of the supply chain and flexibility. We're investing almost nothing in capacity other than what is required to transition the line from an older generation to a newer generation. We expect that we will be well within our business model of 5% to 7%, if you take out the flood-related spending at the lower end or possibly the lower end of the model.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "My first question is just with regard to the inventory that you talked about in the industry. Did you quantify that? And any idea on when that is lifted and why it's there? A little more detail on that.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes, we did not quantify it, and it would be speculation to try to actually estimate it. But we -- now it obviously depends upon we're one player, granted a big player in the industry. And also, it is -- we've got customers and their behavior. But our intent would be to try to eliminate that inventory overhang here before we exit calendar 2012.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "And it's also important, Ben, the -- we continue to operate the channel in an extremely clean fashion. The distribution inventory, including in transit, is significantly less than 3 weeks -- excuse me, 4 weeks.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And just my follow-up's real quick on share repurchase. If you take your $10 guidance as literal, it means about $3 in earnings probably in the March and June quarters. I mean, is there any thought about accelerating share repurchase now so that you have a lower share count for when you have to hit those numbers? Or I guess my question is why not buy back more now and front-load the year with regard to returning your 50% or however much of that goes to buybacks now versus later?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "It's certainly one of the levels available to us, and we're exploring that.", "Operator", "Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan Chase.", "Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just building on Ben's question there around the $10 target, I had a question in terms of the 3 initiatives that Steve mentioned earlier in the call. Are those tantamount or necessary to get to that $10 target? Do you need those to step down as buffers to some of these other dynamics around cannibalization of PCs from smartphones and tablets and other stuff?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Well, I think if you go back, Mark, and you look at what we've talked about in terms of hybrid drive, as well as the helium drive, I assume that's what you're referring to, both of those are not expected to contribute materially to our financial results until the back half of 2013, calendar 2013. But obviously, we need to continue to execute on our broader product roadmap, bring on improvements in terms of our execution against aerial density curves, all those different kinds of things.", "Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then my follow-up question is related to the inventory overhang. Do you think the inventory overhang was driven by some of these long-term agreements that were signed with your competitor earlier this year and that they went to maybe a selective supply chain or bridge here from some of the OEMs and that's what we're having to clean out?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "That certainly contributed to it, yes, Mark.", "Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then maybe as a last follow-up. As a result of those long-term agreements probably ending here pretty soon, have you seen increased discussions certainly from the server and storage OEMs to do more and more business with Western Digital going forward? Because I know a lot of OEMs are kind of disappointed how Seagate did take advantage of that unfortunate situation in Thailand last year.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Well, I think that we talked about it earlier in terms of what we've done in the enterprise segment, and I think there's a lot of different dynamics. The commercial aspect of the relationship is only one aspect. There's also the product aspect, quality aspect, just how you deal with the relationship. So I don't -- I think it's difficult to isolate one particular variable. And what we really have been focused on, frankly, for quite a while is building longer-term endearing relationships with our customers. And we're going to continue to do that.", "Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And thank you, John, for your consistent execution and messaging over the years. Really appreciated it.", "John F. Coyne", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Mark Miller with Noble Financial Capital Market.", "Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "I also like to add that sentiment, John. You've done a very good job with this firm. I guess the question that everyone has, and I know you were asked this before. But there are scenarios out there saying that there is currently production constraints or shortages of flash chips, and with the fabs that are going up, it's going to be hard for flash and then solid state drives to keep on taking -- to keep on cannibalizing drive and PC sales at the rate they've been doing over the last couple of years. Do you agree or disagree with that?", "John F. Coyne", "Well, I think that -- I'm not sure I agree or disagree. I think that there's a lot of different dynamics that are going on. And I think that demand is down for a lot of different reasons, and to try to isolate it to -- it's not so much that SSD, or solid state, is taking over the world right now. Demand just isn't very good across the board. And so I think that we've got to look at it in a broader context. Yes, there is some impact, but I don't think that, that's the only dynamic that's occurring.", "Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "Well, just to follow up on that question. I believe Stephen Luczo said it during their Investor Day that he actually thought that the macroenvironment as well as the product transitions were having a bigger effect on demand and tablet cannibalization. Do you agree or disagree with that?", "John F. Coyne", "I think that's a fair statement. I would tend to agree with that.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "That concludes today's call. Thank you, everyone. We appreciate your questions and look forward to being in touch in the months ahead through our investor relations activities. I want to finish with an expression of thanks, admiration and congratulations to John Coyne for his 30 years of dedicated service to Western Digital, including the last 6 as CEO. He and his team have put Western Digital on a course to create significant additional value for our customers and employees and shareholders in the years ahead. I look forward to being part of that next phase in the company's rich history.", "Operator", "Thank you. This does conclude the conference.

With that, I will turn the call over to Sanjay.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our strong performance in the second half of 2012. Specifically, we began supplying a broader range of embedded products to mobile OEMs, drove strong growth in the computing end market and gained market share in retail across both developed and emerging markets. Our solid execution in light of changing market dynamics allowed us to rebound and drive significant growth in the second half of the year, offsetting a difficult first half of 2012, which was impacted by weak pricing, card debundling among handset OEMs and embedded product transitions with mobile OEMs.", "From a technology standpoint, we executed well on our 19-nanometer transition, and this provides us with an industry-leading flash cost structure. Overall, I'm encouraged with our robust recovery in the second half of 2012, and the company is strongly positioned for continued gains on multiple fronts in 2013.", "In the second half of 2012, we expanded our embedded product portfolio, and we now offer customized embedded solutions and a broad range of iNAND discrete and iNAND MCP, which is our iNAND package with mobile DRAM. In Q4, revenue from our iNAND products alone increased 60% sequentially with the strongest growth stemming from our new iNAND MCP product line. Combined with a very strong revenue increase in the customized embedded solution, our overall embedded sales set a record, growing 45% sequentially, accounting for about 1/3 of our total revenue.", "In solid state drives, I'm pleased to report solid sequential revenue growth from both our client and enterprise products. Total SSD sales were 10% of our fourth quarter revenue. On a year-over-year basis, our full-year SSD sales almost tripled and represented 9% of our 2012 revenue. We expect to grow our SSD revenue sequentially in Q1 2013 both in dollar terms and as a percentage of our overall revenue and we remain on track to drive 25% of our company revenue from SSDs in 2014.", "In the fourth quarter, we began revenue shipments of our SAS SSDs to a fourth storage OEM, and we are working closely with other OEMs to drive adoption of our enterprise SSDs. Of particular note, we have begun shipping what we believe to be the industry's highest capacity 1.6 terabyte SAS drives. In addition, our robust and high-performance SAS drives are seeing increasing adoption through our OEMs by social media and Web 2.0 customers among others.", "We achieved good progress on the software front with the adoption of our FlashSoft offerings by large storage OEM for distribution and future bundling with their servers. As a reminder, we view our enterprise and client SSD software offerings as a key differentiator in terms of the value add that SanDisk brings to our customers.", "Looking ahead, we are working on ways to leverage software to drive industry-leading flash solutions that dramatically accelerate application performance and reduce total cost of ownership of flash-based storage. We look forward to introducing some exciting products to our customers in 2013.", "Our client SSDs continue to garner new design wins, and we are excited about the production ramp of new computing platforms supported by our SATA-based caching and standalone SSD offerings. Two weeks ago, at the Consumer Electronics Show, we launched the SanDisk Ultra Plus SSD for the retail channel and the SanDisk X110 SSD for OEM customers. These new products, manufactured on our leading edge 19-nanometer MLC technology provide performance upgrade over our earlier offerings and should help us to strengthen further our market position. We also began revenue shipments of a new client SSD to an additional major OEM customer and SanDisk now supplies client SSDs to 10 leading PC OEMs.", "To drive further growth in SSDs, we launched a new initiative to offer a broad range of OEM-grade client and enterprise Solutions to value-added resellers, system integrators and direct market resellers. This new distribution channel delivers SanDisk SSD technology to small and medium-sized businesses, which is a growing market for us. Additionally, direct engagement with our cloud customers is progressing well and we are adding resources in these new channels to support their development.", "Retail performance in the fourth quarter was driven by seasonality as well as strong execution that resulted in continued share gain in most regions. Our broad global footprint, diversified product portfolio and brand strength continue to differentiate our retail offerings. In fact, during the fourth quarter, our unit sales of USB flash drives in the retail channel set a new record for us. Furthermore, on a year-over-year basis, the unit mix of our higher-margin SanDisk Ultra and SanDisk Extreme imaging cards increased substantially, reflecting consumer preference for our high-performance products.", "From a manufacturing standpoint, 19-nanometer technology accounted for the vast majority of the production output for the fourth quarter, and we anticipate continued transition to 19-nanometer technology throughout 2013. We also expect a long tail of 24-nanometer technology in 2013 in order to support our OEM customer requirements. We expect to begin the 1Y-nanometer transition in the second half of this year.", "Turning to supply. In 2013, industry supply growth is estimated to be in the 30% to 40% range, and we expect a healthy demand and supply balance and a significantly improved pricing environment. We continue to take a prudent approach to managing wafer capacity expansion in our fabs. We expect continued improvements in fab productivity, providing increases in wafer output during 2013, allowing us to defer the addition of new wafer capacity. We have not yet made a decision about adding new capacity and we are still evaluating the timing and extent of any new capacity addition in 2013.", "Our captive bit supply growth in 2012 was significantly higher than the industry average growth. And in 2013, our planned bit supply growth will be below estimated industry range.", "While our supply growth plan for 2013 may somewhat limit our annual revenue growth, we believe it paves the way for healthier business fundamentals for us and provides us with the flexibility to focus on improving the mix of our product sales and enhancing our profitability.", "Switching to demand drivers, in 2013, we expect the client and enterprise SSD markets to fuel additional demand for NAND flash as an increasing proportion of PCs sold will include solid-state storage and the prevalence of cloud-based services continues to drive flash accelerated data centers. In addition, we expect the mobile market to remain a strong growth engine for the NAND flash industry in 2013 with the launch of many new smartphones and tablet models keeping the mobile market vibrant.", "According to industry analysts, for the first time, unit shipments of smartphones are expected to exceed those of feature phones in 2013. Key drivers for this expected milestone event are growth of low-cost smartphones and market expansion in China and other emerging regions. Further, the availability of the touch functionality in ultra-thin devices and the convergence of smartphones and tablets are giving rise to new product categories represented, for example, by the Samsung Galaxy Note II and LG Optimus, that inherently require high capacity data storage solutions. These trends portend significant growth opportunity for flash memory storage. In addition, we see an increasing number of high definition TV models shipping with not just embedded flash storage, but even with higher capacity SSDs to enable set-top box and media center functionalities.", "At the recently concluded CES, several new models of 4K TV with higher capacities of built-in storage were launched, and all these trends indicate the growing appeal and applications for NAND flash memory beyond smartphones, tablets and PCs. Our broad presence in the consumer, mobile and computing ecosystems, combined with our partnerships with processor and chipset vendors, close collaborative engagement with operating systems and software developers and our heritage of technology and system expertise positions us favorably to contribute to and benefit from these evolving market trends. Our participation in retail OEM and now, in newer channels and direct customer engagement should enable us to expand our market reach over time.", "To conclude, we exited 2012 in a position of increased competitive and financial strength. Our markets remain healthy, growth drivers are diverse and strong and we remain focused on driving profitable growth for our business. I would like to thank you for your support during 2012, and I look forward to your continued interest in SanDisk. With that, I will turn the call over to Judy for her financial review and outlook.", "Judy Bruner", "Thank you, Sanjay. We are pleased to close 2012 with fourth quarter revenue near the record level of last Q4, and with strong profits and cash flow. Our fourth quarter margins benefited from our improving product mix, a healthy industry environment and continued strong execution on cost reduction.", "Our fourth quarter bits sold increased 13% sequentially and 56% year-over-year, bringing the full year 2012 revenue bit growth to 62%. Our ASP per gigabyte increased 7% sequentially, driven by an increased mix of mobile embedded and SSD sales as well as a strong supply-demand balance within our business. Our fourth quarter ASP per gigabyte represented a year-over-year decline of 37%, and our full-year average price was 45% lower than in 2011.", "The mix of our product revenue was 61% OEM and 39% retail for both the fourth quarter and the full year.", "In the retail channel, our fourth quarter revenue grew 15% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. Our retail sequential growth rate was similar across major regions and on a product basis, was strongest for mobile cards. Our retail year-over-year growth represented solid growth in Asia and emerging markets, partially offset by decline in the U.S. and Europe.", "On a product basis, our retail sales grew nicely year-over-year in mobile cards and SSDs, partially offset by a reduction in imaging card revenue as that market continues to experience a shift to mobile phones.", "Within our imaging revenue, the mix shift to higher performance cards has been a positive for gross margin. Our fourth quarter OEM sales grew 27% sequentially and were down 5% year-over-year. We are regaining share in the mobile embedded market and growing our share in the SSD market while managing the secular decline in the bundled card market. Our sales of private label cards and wafers were also down year-over-year as we prioritized supply for our retail, mobile-embedded and SSD products. Our fourth quarter embedded revenue achieved a record $500 million, up 33% year-over-year, and our fourth quarter SSD revenue through the OEM channel grew approximately 95% on a year-over-year basis.", "Our Q4 license and royalty revenue grew $6 million sequentially, primarily reflecting certain onetime royalty payments, bringing our 2012 license and royalty revenue to $374 million, the same level as in 2011.", "Our non-GAAP gross margin increased from 31% in Q3 to 40% in Q4, driven by a sequential blended cost improvement of 7%, coupled with our sequential price increase of 7%. The primary contributors to our Q4 cost improvement were a further increase in 19-nanometer mix and a higher usage of captive memory in our enterprise SSDs. Our overall cost improvement in 2012 was 36%, 5 points higher than we achieved in 2011. Noncaptive petabytes were less than 1% of our sales in Q4, and the yen rate in our cost of sales was approximately JPY 79, similar to both Q3 and the year-ago quarter. The yen began weakening versus the dollar in the second half of Q4, impacting wafer purchases late in Q4 and those wafers will translate into cost of sales with about a 3-month lag. More on this subject when I get to our 2013 forecast.", "Our Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses were $247 million, reflecting sequential growth in R&D and sales and marketing. The Q4 sequential R&D growth came primarily from headcount-related expenses and prototype expenditures, and the marketing growth was driven primarily by headcount, branding and other marketing spend.", "Our Q4 non-GAAP operating margin was 24%, reflecting a strong recovery in profitability. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was 32%, and our diluted share count remained flat sequentially.", "In 2012, we reduced our shares outstanding by approximately 1.1 million shares, as our share repurchase program more than offset issuances under our employee incentive programs.", "On the balance sheet, gross cash and marketable securities increased in Q4 by approximately $300 million to $5.7 billion, and net cash increased to almost $3.8 billion. Our inventory balance decreased in Q4 by $100 million, reflecting strong sales and improved fab cycle time.", "Cash flow from operations in Q4 was $316 million, and we also received $153 million of repayments from the joint ventures. We spent $105 million on CapEx during Q4, primarily for test equipment and facilities outfitting, and we spent $39 million on share repurchases. For the full year, we spent $230 million on share repurchases, retiring over 5.6 million shares.", "In terms of capital spending for the full year 2012, our share of fab-related investments was approximately $500 million, which was funded by joint venture, working capital and equipment leases. And the joint ventures also provided a net return of cash of $319 million to SanDisk, which helped to fund our $488 million in non-fab related capital investments.", "In summary, our cash balance increased by approximately $100 million over the course of 2012, after making total capital investments of approximately $1 billion, and spending approximately $300 million on share repurchases and acquisitions. I'll now turn to forward-looking commentary.", "We expect our 2013 supply growth to reflect minimal growth in wafer capacity, a 1Y transition beginning in the second half and a year-over-year increase in our mix of X2 memory. This will lead to a much lower level of bit growth in 2013 than we experienced in 2012. At the same time, we anticipate a favorable industry supply-demand environment to result in a more moderate rate of industry price decline than in 2012, and we expect our improving product mix to further moderate our price decline. Overall, our estimate for 2013 revenue is $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion. We expect to experience typical seasonality with a soft first quarter and a strong fourth quarter, and our first quarter revenue estimate is $1.225 billion to $1.3 billion.", "We expect to generate strong gross margins in 2013, given our expectation of a healthy supply-demand environment, our evolving product mix and a weaker yen. In terms of the yen, I'll give you some color on how this will likely impact our results across the year. Our Q1 costs are largely determined based on wafer purchases made in Q4, and the majority of those purchases were made before the yen weakened significantly, giving us an average rate for Q1 of approximately 81. Our Q2 cost of sales will be largely based on Q1 wafer purchases and we made a decision at the end of 2012 to fix the cost of those purchases at a rate of about 86. After which, the yen weakened further. So if the yen were to stay where it has recently been trading, the benefit to our gross margins will be the greatest in the second half of 2013.", "Given our estimates for costs, pricing and product mix, we forecast a non-GAAP gross margin for Q1 of 38% plus or minus 2 points, and for the full year of 2013, we forecast 41% plus or minus 2 points.", "Non-GAAP operating expenses for 2013 are forecasted to be approximately $1.05 billion, with approximately $255 million in the first quarter. The primary expense increases will be in memory technology development and in SSD R&D and go-to-market capabilities and we also expect to incur higher incentive compensation expense in 2013 relative to a reduced level in 2012.", "We expect non-GAAP other income of approximately $5 million per quarter or $20 million for the year. Our tax rate will reflect a discrete benefit in Q1 due to the passage of the retroactive 2012 R&D tax credit. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 28% in Q1 and approximately 31% for the rest of the year, yielding a non-GAAP rate of approximately 30.5% for the full year. Based on our 2013 forecast for revenue, gross margin and operating expenses, we expect non-GAAP operating margins to be in our long-term financial model of 20% to 24% in 2013, up from the 16% we achieved in 2012.", "Turning to a few items related to the balance sheet and use of cash. Our 2013 capital investments are expected to be approximately $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, assuming no new wafer capacity beyond productivity improvements, with the increase from 2012, primarily reflecting increased capital intensity for the 1Y-nanometer transition. We expect the fab portion of this capital investment, which is estimated at $850 million to $950 million to be funded by a combination of joint venture cash flow and equipment leases and the nonfab capital investments of approximately $350 million to be a use of cash during 2013. We expect to generate strong growth in free cash flow in 2013, and we plan to continue to utilize our stock repurchase plan with an objective to, at a minimum, offset the share dilution from our employee equity programs.", "Next, I'd like to describe a couple of changes that we will make in our reporting in 2013. First, because license and royalty revenue has been less than 10% of our total revenue for 3 years now, we will no longer show a separate line item for this revenue on our P&L. Going forward, we will report total revenue on the P&L, and we will provide supplementary schedules at the time of our earnings call as to the mix of our revenue by major categories including license and royalty. We have added these supplementary revenue schedules to the metrics we publish on our website beginning this quarter. These schedules provide revenue by major end market and by form factor. Another change will be how we refer to our channels in our earnings releases and in our SEC reports beginning for fiscal year 2013. As we are moving into the B2B channel and direct engagement with enterprise customers, we will recast our OEM channel as the commercial channel, which will include OEM, B2B and direct enterprise customers as well as licensees. Thus, the channel breakdown of our total revenue will include the retail and the commercial channels.", "In closing, we are pleased with the improvements we have achieved in the second half of 2012 in our product offerings, our customer engagement and our revenue, profits and cash flow. As we look forward to 2013, we expect to continue gaining competitive strength, and we are focused on delivering solid year-over-year revenue growth with strong profitability and free cash flow. We will now open the call for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go to the first caller, Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "First of all, I want to ask about your expectations for supply growth for the year of the 30% to 40%. Does that assume that any -- you or any of your competitors add any wafer capacity in the back half of the year? And if your competitors were to do so, what do you think the upper bound of that range might be or might change to?", "Judy Bruner", "In terms of our assumptions, the 30% to 40% bit supply growth is an assumption for the overall industry. As Sanjay said, we expect our supply bit growth to be somewhat less than that range. In terms of the assumptions relative to ourselves, we've assumed that we do not add new capacity in 2012 -- sorry, 2013 beyond productivity improvements. But we will get some increase in wafer capacity from our productivity improvements, which are very cost-effective. In terms of the rest of the industry, we have made some assumptions for some additional wafer capacity growth from competitors in the second half of the year, yes.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then as a follow-on, can you share with us your expectation for this year in terms of the -- if you strip out the yen, what the apples for apples cost decline will be for 2013? And then can you comment on any yen hedging activity you've performed so far this year and what your plans are?", "Judy Bruner", "Okay. So we're not going to give a specific cost reduction forecast or range for 2013 but I will say that the cost reduction that we expect to achieve in 2013 is quite a bit less than the 36% cost reduction that we achieved in 2012. And that is inclusive of the benefit that we will get from the yen. I'm going to come back to cost reduction a minute -- in a minute but to answer your question on the yen, we have largely fixed the rate of the yen for the first half of 2013. If I assume that the yen stays about where it is for the rest of the year and that, that is what we achieve in our second half of the year, then the overall year should benefit by roughly about 3 percentage points in terms of cost improvement on a year-over-year basis. But that 3 percentage point improvement is embedded within our expectation that cost improvement will be less in 2013 than in 2012. Mentioned several reasons why that is the case. If you think about our cost improvement in 2013, first, we will get less improvement from 1Y than we did from 19-nanometer, which was the major cost reduction driver in 2012. Second, the timing of the 1Y transition will also lead to less cost reduction. Let me come back to that in a minute. Third, we expect that our product demand requirements will lead us to have a lower mix of X3 wafers in 2013 relative to 2012. And even our product mix itself is evolving towards products that have a higher non-memory content and also tend to stay on the older nodes somewhat longer because of OEM requirements. So that also leads to a lower year-over-year cost per gigabyte improvement. Now the yen goes the other way and partially offset some of these factors but all in all, we still believe that our cost reduction will be quite a bit less than the 36%. And just -- I said I wanted to come back to the 1Y timing. We said that the 1Y transition will essentially begin in the third quarter. And if you compare that to last year, our 19-nanometer transition actually began in the fourth quarter of 2011. So we benefited all during 2012 from the 19-nanometer transition. And 24-nanometer will continue to stay alive during 2013 as well. I know that's a long answer but I hope that answered your question.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Guys, I'm just wondering, when you look at your 20-nanometer, 19-nanometer, what is the mix now, what is the mix by the end of the year between 24 and 19?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So in Q4, more than 2/3 of our bit production was in 19-nanometer. And as we look at 2013, we will be ramping up 19-nanometer throughout the course of the year and 24-nanometer long tail of production will continue during 2013 as well, due to certain OEM requirements for certain products. And as Judy pointed out and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks as well, 1Y transition will begin in the third quarter.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then on the SSD side, you guys have been doing very well. You mentioned you added a fourth OEM customer on the storage side. What is giving you -- how -- when you look at your products, what is the edge you have over the competition? How do you see you gaining more share in 2013, if you can lay out the roadmap there?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So in 2013, the share gain opportunities are of course, continuing penetration of the SAS drives with our leading-edge solution and the edge that we get is the full benefit of vertical integration, the flash memory technology, flash memory capacity and supply for the customers. But on top of all of that, the controller, which is the home developed ASIC. As that -- the appliance team, part of SanDisk now has developed. And all the firmware algorithms to really manage the reliability and the performance and the endurance of these SAS drives so that ultimately, the customer gets predictable performance. And this is a key differentiator for us in our products, giving customers predictable performance over a variety of workloads that they may be running over these SAS drives. So we look at gaining share in SAS drives. Our share in PCIe has been small. We only launched that product in 2012. As we bring out our next-generation PCIe products, we expect to be gaining share in the PCIe segment as well. So we're excited about the opportunities in enterprise SSD space for us, both on the side of SAS drives as well as PCIe, as well as continue to engage with customers for SATA enterprise drives as well. And again, the benefit of vertical integration, owning the memory technology, knowing the roadmap of memory technology and all the intricacies involved for the future and being able to implement the features in the controller to give high reliability, high performance solutions to our customers is an edge. And I might as well add here that software too, which is something we acquired FlashSoft and Schooner, give us strong competencies to be able to differentiate our SSD offerings with our customers in the future.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Got it. Great. And as you on the OEM side, does it mean that your focus on retail, you're focusing less there and so does that imply better margins and less cyclicality in the core business?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We are certainly focused on continuing to strengthen the mix of our business and in that regard, absolutely driving for strong growth in SSD, both on the client and enterprise SSD. And then in the mobile space, our embedded business is growing nicely but I'll point out that retail is a very important part of our business. Retail is higher margins than corporate averages and we have a strong brand recognition, #1 global shares. SanDisk is really very well-positioned on retail and our strategy is to continue to drive for strong mix of our business and strong opportunities in retail, as well as in enterprise SSDs and embedded. So pedal to the metal on OEM and retail opportunities with a focus on driving a strong combination of revenue, profits and cash flow.", "Operator", "We'll take the next question from Daniel Amir with Lazard.", "Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Can you expand a little about in terms of your gross margin guidance, how should we look at the overall cost decline, how should we look at the [indiscernible] year and what type of price assumptions should we be looking at first half versus second half? So just a little more clarity around kind of your annual gross margin guidance. And then I have one follow-up.", "Judy Bruner", "Okay. So Daniel, as I said a few minutes ago, we expect that the cost decline in 2013 will be quite a bit less than it was in 2012, and I enumerated the reasons why. We would expect that cost decline can -- is really going down for everyone in the industry. The physics are the same here. There are factors in our improving product mix in terms of the mix of our business that may cause our cost decline year-over-year to go down by a somewhat higher percentage. But we achieved a very strong cost improvement in 2012. We have, in the past, talked about a range of a 25% to 35% cost reduction per year, and I believe that as we move to the remaining nodes on NAND that, that cost reduction capability is coming down towards the lower end, if not below the low end of that range. You cut out for a minute when you were asking your question. You were asking about price as well. But did you mention something else? Was it yen?", "Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Yes, I mean, the pricing and then the X2, X3 mix?", "Judy Bruner", "Oh, X2, X3 mix. In terms of the X2, X3 mix, our X3 mix was about 50% in 2012, and we would estimate that it would go to something like about 40% in 2013 given the product demand requirements that we see from our customers. And then in terms of price, we are expecting a very favorable supply-demand environment in 2013, and that we expect that will cause a much shallower level of price decline in 2013 than in 2012. And we expect that our product mix will impact our price decline to be even shallower just as it is impacting our cost reduction to be shallower. And so overall for 2013, we expect price decline to be less than cost decline and that is why we're able to give gross margin guidance at the midpoint of 41%, up from the 34% that we achieved in 2012.", "Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Great. And my follow-up, maybe to Sanjay, is on the SSD side, you're expecting a big growth this year on the SSD front. I mean, if you had upside, where would the upside come from on the SSD front? Would it be from the PC side or the enterprise side?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We plan to be driving strong growth both on the client side as well as the enterprise side. And certainly, on the client side the ultra-thin devices are driving increasing adoption of SSDs, both caching solutions and standalone solutions. And our penetration in the standalone SSD space is continuing to increase nicely. And on the enterprise side, as we bring forward during the course of the year our next edition products on SAS as well as PCIe, we look forward to driving strong gains there as well. So we will really continue to look at our opportunities on both fronts and as we have said, we'll continue to focus on managing the mix of the business with our objective of managing revenue growth, balanced with profit growth as well. And of course, we'll keep in mind long term strategic considerations with respect to customer engagement in mind as well. So I think the market is growing very nicely for the client SSDs in terms of industry term [ph] as well as for the enterprise SSDs.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Jagadish Iyer with Piper Jaffray.", "[Technical Difficulty]", "And hearing no response, we'll go to the next caller, John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I guess my first question, guys, just relative to the lead times on litho tools, how late in the year can you go before having to make a decision on adding wafer start capacity for this year? And Judy, if you were to make the decision to move ahead with Fab 5, how do we think of CapEx?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So I will comment on the litho tools. As we've said before, we work closely with the fab tools at vendors in terms of managing our expectation and their delivery for tools. We have said that generally the lead times are in the neighborhood of 4 months, around 4 months. So as you can see if we were to add any capacity in the second half of the year, we still have time to make that decision. But again, we've not really made any decision regarding any additional capacity in the second half yet.", "Judy Bruner", "And relative to the CapEx, the guidance I provided of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion does not include any new wafer capacity in Fab 5. And so if we were to begin to add wafer capacity later in 2013, that number would go up. But since we haven't made a decision, I really can't give you what that range would be.", "John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And then guys as my follow-up, just quickly, any 10% customers in the December quarter, and would you expect there to be any 10% customers coming up in March relative to your guidance?", "Judy Bruner", "We did have a 10% customer in Q4 and a 10% customer for the year. We will be reporting that customer in our 10-K since it was above the 10% for the year. So I'll give it to you now and that customer was Apple, and the total percentage for 2012 was a bit below 13%. And we continue to have strong diversity of our customers. I will mention that our top 2 customers in 2012 were 22% of our revenue and that, that compared to 19% in 2011.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Raji Gill with Needham & Company.", "Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Just on the top line guidance, if I understood it correctly, it was $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion, which basically implies something like 8% year-over-year growth. Given kind of a more favorable environment in terms of the demand drivers, the significant demand drivers in smartphones as well as the retail in USB, expecting why that growth -- that year-over-year growth might have not been a bit higher, could you maybe talk a little bit about the growth drivers for the year by product segment and along those lines, any commentary on the bundled -- the attach rates for bundled cards in your core business segments?", "Judy Bruner", "Okay. Let me start out here. So first of all, I want to point out that we do expect to have limited bit growth in our revenue in 2013. It will be quite a bit less than it was in 2012. As we indicated, we expect our supply bit growth to be less than the industry range of 30% to 40%. Now that doesn't necessarily translate straight into revenue bit growth because we could have changes in our inventory. We could potentially purchase some noncaptive, although I expect that noncaptive usage in a tight supply demand environment would be limited. So we have somewhat -- we have limited bit growth but we then expect to also have quite shallow price decline. And that is what allows us to achieve the revenue growth that we're achieving. I will say that we do expect to be somewhat supply constrained in 2013, but I believe we manage our business best when we are somewhat supply constrained. And that allows us to prioritize our supply to the best product mix and to really take into account gross margins as well as strategic considerations in how we allocate that supply. In terms of the product categories, Sanjay I think has sort of already discussed this but I'll repeat that we believe the highest growth area for us in 2013 will be the SSD segments, both the client and the enterprise. And then next, I would point to mobile embedded as the next highest growth area. We do expect that there will be continuing trend in card debundling, and that there can be a reduction in the revenue that comes from those removable products. And we will, as Sanjay said, continue to allocate and prioritize supply to retail as much as possible because that is another very important part of our business that generates strong margins and strong brand recognition. So overall, we feel very good about the model for 2013. We think that it's good revenue growth and that it gives the best combination of growth and profitability and cash flow.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "And regarding your question on the slot-in [ph] rate, based on the third-party reports that are available, that in terms of all feature phones now, maybe about 3/4 of the -- not feature phones -- in terms of all mobile phones, about 3/4 of all mobile phones today have slots in them and this large percentage rate is expected to decline over the course of next 3 to 4 years, maybe by 2015, 2016 time frame as a percentage of all mobile phones, this number getting into the 60s. And particularly in smartphones, about 3/4 of the smartphones again today have card slots in them. And that number over the course of next 3 to 4 years is expected to decline to something in the 50 to 60 range. And of course, this is a comment on the card slot, embedded storage within the smartphones continuing -- within the smartphones as well as budget smartphones and overall in the mobile phone category really continues to increase strongly and SanDisk is well-positioned to address both card as well as embedded opportunities with a broad line of our products there. So overall, the unit time for flash continues to expand nicely in the industry, particularly on the embedded side.", "Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "I appreciate that, Sanjay. Just one last question on the SSD, you're committing to the 25% of revenue. If I just kind of do the quick calculation on the math, it seems like it's something at least $1.4 billion of -- or over, of SSD revenue. I'm just wondering how you're able to kind of bridge that gap from exiting last year -- entering this year to that number and a year from now.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So we're really not providing any specific guidance in terms of 2014 revenue. But 2014 in terms of SSD our strategy is to continue to focus on driving growth to get to 25% plus in 2014 of our total revenue to be the contribution from SSDs. And in 2013, I would expect our SSD contribution for the full-year to be above 15%.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.", "Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Can you talk about the use of 3-bit-per-cell product within OEM markets and within SSDs? I know your primary competitor has been talking about using TLC more broadly in those markets, how do you see that now?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So in SSD space, we're very much focused on driving the growth of our business and gaining share in the mainstream section of the SSD market. And the mainstream section of the SSD market, using leading-edge flash memory technology really requires high-performance and high reliability as well. And those in the industry we believe are best supplied with X2 memory. So our focus, as we focus on -- our focus as we try to drive for greater share on the client SSD is to supply the mainstream of the market and mainstream of the market is really needing X2 memory. So in 2013, we plan to be supplying our client SSD demand, as well as our enterprise SSD demand with X2 memory. Of course, we constantly assess X3 memory application for the SSDs but it's not in our 2013  roadmap.", "Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And within OEMs, smartphone or tablet, is that also similarly still primarily X2 this year?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "The increasing performance requirements, particularly when you look at smartphones and tablets with their high resolution capabilities, bigger displays, and now even using quad core in these devices, they really expect a strong performance from flash memory and the quad core kind of applications with all the imaging and video processing capabilities can even require a strong random performance, strong flash memory and all of that really positions X2 as the best candidate to really provide the flash solutions for these markets.", "So in the mobile segment, mobile embedded segment, we will continue to support that with X2. Although there is some element of X3 memory, particularly in our iNAND products, that will continue to do well as well. And of course, on the card side, our cards are built with X3 memory. So Judy said that X3 as a total percentage of our business will be around 40% in 2013, will be coming down from 50% to 40% due to the growth in embedded and SSDs. But we believe that we will have a very strong lead over the rest of the competition in 2013 with our X3 memory.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Mark Newman with Sanford Bernstein.", "Mark C. Newman - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "I have a quick question. I think we're simply poised to set up a very, very good 2013 due to supply discipline. And I just wanted to see maybe if you could talk to, a little bit, about how you think about adding capacity and how you think the industry thinks about adding capacity, so that it gives us a little bit more comfort that the industry is not going to add capacity. For example, at what kind of gross margin or cost of capital will you consider to actually add capacity? And due to technological risk in the industry, has that changed from before?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So when we look at making decisions on adding capacity, the factors that we look at are certainly, our demand-supply expectations, our expectations regarding total output from our production in the fabs, including any productivity gains that we are planning on in the fabs. And our technology roadmap such as 1Y technology this year that will be introduced in the Q3 time frame. The progress of that technology roadmap. And we certainly keep an eye on the future technologies as well and potential requirements of those future technologies. Because it's very important that any new investments that we make in capacity, we feel good about ROI on that capacity for the future. So these are really some of the factors and of course, we're always assessing for our own decisions the demand from our customers in terms of determining the timing of our -- any capacity additions. So what -- really multiple factor that we are look at. And we look at it all within the framework of our strategy of driving for revenue, profit and cash flow.", "Mark C. Newman - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "So is there any numbers you can provide behind that in terms of gross margin or return on capital -- return on investment calculation?", "Judy Bruner", "There's not a specific benchmark or threshold number that we are looking for that would best cause us to add capacity. But we clearly are looking at all the factors that Sanjay described, including gross margin and return on investment. And we do return on investment analyses quite frequently when we're analyzing adding capacity. And of course, as Sanjay described, the future technology roadmap and the equipment set for that roadmap is one of the key factors that we analyze when we take a look at that; as is the supply-demand environment for our business. But not a specific threshold.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Dean Grumlose - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "This is Dean Grumlose calling in for Kevin. As you look out at your forecast for the full year, could you characterize the assumptions that you make -- be making about the content in PCs and tablets as far as the increased content on a per platform basis?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So in terms of the PCs, by average capacities, we would expect them to continue to increase. The full SSD average capacity, third-party reports are available that show continuing increases of these average capacities. And on the caching side, the average capacities will remain in high 20s to low 30s on an average basis. The full client SSD in terms of enterprise -- in terms of full SSDs plus caching, will continue to increase in capacity. In terms of tablets, there is quite a bit of segmentation in various categories of tablets. There are certain tablets that are toward the low end, other tablets that are toward the high end. The high-end tablets we would expect that over time, the average capacities would increase. But overall for tablets, if you look at third-party report, because of the growth in the tablet and particularly a lot of the growth in the lower end tablet categories, as this market segment supply becomes bigger, the average capacity for tablet actually I think somewhat declines. But keep in mind that average capacity in tablets are 3x to 4x higher than the average capacities in smartphones.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna International.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Sanjay, as you look at into -- have a more profitable revenue stream, how do you prioritize customers especially now that you have, I think, your largest customer 2012 is a new large customer and you also mentioned the penetration into the SSD but there's -- but given how limited capacity you're building into the assumptions, I imagine it's going to be a way to think about prioritization and any color you can provide on that, I would appreciate and I have a follow-up.", "Judy Bruner", "Let me start out here. Sanjay may want to add on. But clearly, there are a number of factors that play into our prioritization of supply and gross margin is clearly one of them, as is the strategic importance of the products and the customers. And we really look at maintaining diversity of our customer base and our product portfolio. And I think we did a very good job of that in 2012 and especially in Q4. And so I think we have demonstrated that we are able to allocate our supply between the client SSDs, the enterprise SSDs, the mobile embedded as well as our retail and other removable products.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Yes, I don't really have much more to add other than just saying that we definitely look at increasing our opportunities with the customer base that has long-term stickiness for our customer as well. So strategic considerations play an important role as well as of course, driving for our objective of revenue and profit growth as well. And within that framework, we feel very comfortable with 2013 capacity plans that we have. We believe it will give us the opportunity to drive growth in the embedded SSD as well as the retail segment. And yes, we -- the white label channels or other component channels will become somewhat smaller mix of our total revenue. But even there, we do like to be a supplier in those channels because we do believe in diversified -- being a strong supplier with a diversified set of products to a diversified set of customers and channels.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "And the follow-up is, if the industry as a whole has become more disciplined and focused on profitability, do you think there's going to be a structural change in the mix of the contract or the length of the contract versus spot transactions?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Mix of the contract or length of the contract, you mean in terms of the OEM customers? Certain customers work on a month-to-month basis. Some of them we have discussions around surrounding key business metrics on a quarterly basis. And so this is really a whole mix of considerations that vary from customer to customer. And of course, as the industry conditions change, it is possible that there may be some change from certain customers in some direction here but really nothing noticeable to report here.", "Operator", "And we'll take the next question from Bob Gujavarty with Deutsche Bank.", "Bobby Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I think one of the interesting trends is it sounds like the SSD business is going to grow Q-on-Q and that sounds a lot better than typical seasonality. Can you talk a little bit about the trends? Is that broad-based both client and enterprise? Just kind of what you're seeing there.", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. I'll take that, Bob. I would say as we look into Q1 here in the SSD business, we are gaining share in that business, both client and enterprise in a very fast-growing part of the market. And so therefore, you're right. It bucks the seasonality trend that we see in the traditional parts of our business. And yes, we expect to be able to grow overall and in both parts of that business.", "Bobby Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. Maybe a quick follow-up to that. Is there any anecdotal evidence that suggests maybe we've reached a tipping point here? Maybe the mix of the cache versus the all SSD solution that OEMs are looking? Curious if you can even offer some kind of maybe tipping point, anecdotal evidence on the SSD side?", "Judy Bruner", "I'd say in terms of anecdotal, we are seeing in particular, strength in the client side of the SSD business. So that in particular is where we expect to see growth as we move into Q1.", "Operator", "And our last question will come from Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets.", "Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "If you could talk about, Judy, if I look at the JV, it sounds like you had some positive cash flow there. Are you expecting to see positive cash flow out of the JV in 2013?", "Judy Bruner", "Not necessarily cash onto our balance sheet in 2013 because we do expect somewhat higher capital expenditures by the JV in 2013. I mentioned that in 2012, the joint venture capital expenditures on our behalf was about $500 million, and that in 2013, I expect it to be in the range of $850 million to $950 million, assuming that we don't do any new wafer capacity. So that increase from $500 million to $850 million to $950 million probably means that the JV can fund that expenditure in 2013 but not return cash to the SanDisk balance sheet like it did in 2012, that number being $319 million in 2012.", "Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then as my follow-up, can you give us an update on where you stand with your royalty agreements with your licensees? It looks like 3-bit in one of your competitors is ramping and has ramped. I believe that, that has a higher royalty to you. Can you give us some update on how that will flow through your numbers?", "Judy Bruner", "We don't go into the specific elements of the license agreements that we have with our licensees. We expect that our license and royalty revenue will be strong in 2013, but I would tell you that I expect our product revenue to grow as a mix percentage of the total revenue.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Doug. Thank you, Judy. Thank you, Sanjay. Elizabeth, that's all the time we have for today. We want to thank everyone for joining us. A webcast replay of today's call should be available on our Investor Relations website shortly.

Welcome to the Western Digital's second quarter financial results for fiscal year 2013. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.", "Robert Blair", "Thank you, and good afternoon. I want to mention that we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning growth in the storage industry and our position and opportunities in the industry, HDD demand for the March quarter and calendar year 2013 and our financial results expectations for the March quarter.

The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures.", "[Operator Instructions] I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investor section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of this call. I would now like to turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Milligan", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, CFO, Wolfgang Nickl, will provide additional commentary on our December quarter results and outlook for the March quarter.", "I am pleased with our financial performance in the December quarter. The quarter exhibited continued soft industry demand driven by macroeconomic uncertainty, weak PC demand and inventory rebalancing by our customers. Over the last several quarters, both of our subsidiaries have done an excellent job of managing through challenging market conditions. This is particularly noteworthy given our company's specific cost challenges associated with the recovery from the Thailand floods. We have continued to focus intensely on those variables we control, allowing us to produce better-than-expected revenue and profitability and strong cash generation.", "In calendar 2013, we have several opportunities to improve our business. We believe that the overall market for hard drives is beginning to stabilize. We expect demand for the first half of calendar 2013 to be flat to slightly down compared with the back half of 2012. However, we are cautiously optimistic for the back half of 2013 for the following reasons: Worldwide economies continue to expand, albeit at a slow pace, with signs of further improvement in developing regions. OEM customers have largely worked through their inventory rebalancing. Accordingly, we have improving visibility with regards to true customer demand. Our customers are accelerating their product innovation with thinner and lighter designs, coupled with touch-enabled features and there are early indications of consumers' stronger intentions to purchase new PCs this year.", "I am most pleased with Western Digital's leadership position in the storage industry. We sit at the center of a vast ecosystem where data growth continues unabated. In this context, we continue to have multiple opportunities to create value for our shareholders, customers and employees. We are working to develop and bring the market innovative solutions in 3 areas: the public and private clouds, thin and light client systems and the Connected Life or personal cloud for homes and small businesses.", "Specifically, in the cloud environment, demand for our high-capacity drives remained strong. Total cost of ownership is a significant issue for our customers in the high-capacity market, and we have seen broad interest in our new 7 disk helium-filled drive. This innovative solution will deliver 40% energy savings over current offerings. Our expanding portfolio of enterprise class solid state drives continues to gain increasing acceptance with our customers. For the third consecutive quarter, we had double-digit revenue growth with our SSD enterprise drives.", "In the thin and light category, customers are increasingly deploying our 7-millimeter hard drives, and enthusiasm for our new 5-millimeter and solid state hybrid drive platforms is high.", "And for the Connected Life, we continue to develop solutions that help consumers manage, store, access and experience their personal and professional content seamlessly. With more ways to create and share content, consumers are increasingly turning to external drives as the best storage choice.

We are also seeing tablet users increasingly adopt our network attached storage for added capacity.", "In my new role as the CEO of Western Digital, I am excited to be leading this great company at such a compelling time of change and opportunity in the storage industry.

We saw continued inventory rebalancing at our OEM customers and our distribution retail channel inventory continues to be lean. By challenging market conditions, both from a macro and IT perspective, we delivered very strong financial results.", "Revenue for the quarter was $3.8 billion. Excluding shipment to Toshiba under our divestiture agreement, we shipped a total of 59.2 million hard drives. Our average HDD selling price was $62, flat with the prior quarter. Favorable mix offset modest like-for-like price decline.", "Our gross margin for the quarter was 27.7%. Excluding $38 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST intangible assets, non-GAAP gross margin was 28.7%. Non-GAAP gross margin was approximately 70 basis points better than what was implied in our guidance, which was a function of lower-than-anticipated price declines and better-than-expected mix.", "R&D and SG&A spending totaled $540 million for the December quarter. SG&A included $11 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST intangible assets.", "We incurred charges of $41 million in the December quarter reflecting continued discipline in aligning our operations with anticipated market demand. As a reminder, we've already incurred charges of $80 million and $26 million in the June and September quarters, respectively.  Net interest and other nonoperating expense was $10 million.", "Tax expense for the December quarter was $133 million or 28% of pretax income. Tax expense included a one-time charge of $88 million due to the passage of Proposition 39 in California. Without this one-time charge, tax expense would have been $45 million or 8% of non-GAAP pretax income.", "Our net income for the December quarter totaled $335 million or $1.36 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $513 million or $2.09 per share.", "Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $772 million in cash from operations during the December quarter and our free cash flow totaled $526 million. Our CapEx for the December quarter totaled $246 million.

Gross margin of approximately 28% excluding the amortization of HGST intangibles. We expect R&D and SG&A spending to be approximately $540 million, excluding the amortization of HGST intangibles, a tax rate of approximately 7% and a share count of approximately 244 million.

I guess the first is on the mix dynamic that you expect to -- you experienced in the December quarter and expect to experience in the March quarter. Can you talk to some of the specifics of what you're seeing. And I mean, I guess to the extent you can talk about what, how, I guess what would you expect kind of as we go through the year, if we should expect what's going to happen in March to extend beyond that, and I have a follow-up.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Ananda, yes, the December quarter was favorable and mixed both from a product mix perspective and also from a business mix perspective. You can see that also from our Investors summary page. Notebook and desktop were combined slightly down when compared to the September quarter, enterprise and branded were up quite a bit. So you can see we had a quite significant positive impact from a business mix, which led to us maintaining the $62 ASP. When you look into the March quarter, you usually see PC sales just seasonally going down by some percentage, probably 6% to 8% if you look at history. And in the branded sales, it's slowing down a little bit after the holiday season. So those are the 2 major impacts that, just from a mix perspective, weigh in on the ASP.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Got it, okay. And I guess as far as benefit from mix, as you move through the year, your major competitor has kind of been talking about they expect industry mix dynamics to lean more positive as you move through the year both within the books and then also with hybrid being introduced in May. Just interested in getting your thoughts on, I guess, how sudden the mix can be as we go through the year and the impact that could have on the industry business model.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes, I'll take that question. I think that, I mean, one of the things that we have to keep in mind, I mean, really 2 comments: I mean, one, mix is always a bit of a dynamic thing and it's something that we, from a business standpoint, actively manage to improve our overall financial performance. So there's a lot of, call it, tactical things that we do within a quarter to make sure that we are getting an appropriate amount of mixup with our customers and with our products and that sort of thing. But the other thing that I think that we have to keep in mind, which is a very important point in that the secular changes that are occurring within the industry are actually very favorable from a mix perspective. So clearly, where we've seen pressure from a volume perspective has been on the client space. That traditionally has -- carries a lower ASP, a lower mix. But where we continue to see very solid growth, although at a lower unit number, has been in the higher capacity enterprise space, particularly the cloud. And then not only that, in terms of the branded business or the personal cloud or Connected Life. And so those things, as you move through the year, and not only that but I think as we move forward into the future, we'll continue to benefit our business both from a average selling price perspective or a mix perspective and then accordingly, if we continue to do our jobs appropriately, from an overall margin perspective.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rich Kugele of Needham & Company.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "The yen, the changes in the currency relative to the dollar, did that help or hurt the business in the quarter? And I have a follow-up.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "It was a little bit of a help for us on the OpEx side. And going forward, we're including the yen in our hedging program. So it should have minimal impact on ongoing results.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "And then in terms of your own procurement from a component perspective over the balance of '13, can you just update us on your own progress on internal production levels or capability?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, we're planning on steady progress and towards the latter end of the year, we'll be in within our purchasing parameters and also mixing into the new areal density. So we're making steady progress there.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "So we have some more work to do.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "By the end of the year, do you mean the fiscal year or the calendar?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "I think we'll make progress throughout the calendar year.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And let me just ask one on the OpEx. You guided to $540 million, which is obviously up when you adjust out for the items. Presumably the $540 million is exiting items. So where is the increase sequentially?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, Richard, what we do is, I mean, we talked before that we have a pretty -- focusing on operating our OpEx pretty variable and we have 6  months incentive programs and since -- when we set them on the July time frame, our expectation of total market demand was different. They didn't quite payout at the level that we anticipated originally and that's why we guided to $525 million. Obviously, we performed better than our guidance. So they paid out a little bit higher and then we have the said impact from the yen, well, that will get us to the $529 million. So the $540 million is a bit of progress compared to the $550 million run rate that we referred to earlier, but the main difference is incentive payouts, Rich.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Stifel, Nicholas.", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I think you alluded to a little bit of it in the last question, but when I look at your gross margin and I think about it from a COGS per unit basis, it looks like it was up sequentially this last quarter and actually getting close to that, what would be historically a high level. So I guess my question is you mentioned areal density and you'd make progress towards that. Could you talk a little bit about where you're at on that areal density curve and when those yields start to show up? And how maybe we should think about the COGS per unit number as a function of gross margin?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, again, I mean, both Steve and I commented on business mix changes. We got to be really, really careful with the COGS per unit because there's so many different businesses blended in. Again, I'll point you to the enterprise and branded numbers where we disclosed the volume and you'll see that we had pretty good sequential increases there. In terms of the areal density, we have said before, partly due to the flood, we're behind on deploying those. We're nowhere close to being done on this and, again, I don't think we'll make progress there throughout the fiscal year -- calendar year. Steve?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Aaron, let me add a comment there. I think that relative to -- there's a lot of things that are going on in terms of our cost, and I just want to give you my perspective. One of the things -- and let's be realistic with regards to ourselves. We have seen versus where we were before, and this is an industry statement, a pretty significant decrease in volumes. So if we -- it would be unfair to isolate per se cost opportunities that we have to areal density alone, right? We have -- we obviously have more capacity than what we're producing because we're throttling it to what we see as demand. But we are taking actions to reset our capacity potential to a more appropriate level given what we view the secular changes in terms of the overall demand profile for the industry, not that we don't expect to see growth but not at the same rates than what we've historically done. So the point being is that there are multiple opportunities that we have as an organization to continue to improve our cost structure. And it's an area, it is probably other than innovation and those kinds of things and introducing some of the new products that we've talked about, getting traction in regards to that as we move to the back half of the year, and continuing to improve our cost structure on multiple fronts is one of the larger opportunities that we have as an organization.", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "As a follow-up, obviously, there's a lot of talk about hybrids. You talked about 7-millimeter, a lot of interest. Where do you stand on the current 5-millimeter platform? And should we expect those to start to materialize from a volume or design cycle basis by the end of calendar '13?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes. So what we talked about before and it continues to be the case is that right now what we're doing is we're shipping engineering samples to customers. We're actively engaged with them in terms of working with them as to how to utilize the new form factor as well as the solid state hybrid drive. We're making good progress in that regard. But we don't expect any revenue to materialize until we move into the back half of calendar 2013, with hopefully it being more of a meaningful contributor particularly as we move into 2014, calendar.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Cindy Shaw of DISCERN.", "Cindy Shaw - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc", "If you could give us an update, I'd appreciate it. You mentioned it. It sounds like you still -- like you've got a better sense of cyclical versus secular. If you could give us some color on any changes in that and how you're feeling about it and then I have a follow-up.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "I think that the 2 secular things that we're really dealing with and, obviously, they're related is, one, reset of overall volumes, and I talked about that earlier. And oh by the way, we talked about it at the Investor Day overall. We are not going to put our head in the sand and disregard the changes that are occurring around us, and so volume levels are lower than what we had seen, call it, pre-flood, and it's not just a flood dynamic obviously. It's changes that we're seeing within the overall IT space. And so we're dealing with that in terms of how we react from that perspective. And then additionally is where we are seeing growth in data and the innovations and the products that are required, and so we're seeing -- and that's when we talk about the 3 areas of investment in terms of the Connected Life, in terms of thin and light, and then as well in terms of the public and private cloud. So we're repositioning and continuing to reposition our roadmap and repositioning our investments to those areas so that we're appropriately optimized in those regards.", "Cindy Shaw - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc", "And then as we do look at some of those investment areas, the thin and light, I know expectations are going into the Windows 8 launch were, for many people, quite high. If you could give us any sort of updated view that you might have on that. And also elaborate to Connected Life, if you have done any sort of -- and I know that's historically sort of looking out into this kind [ph] a little bit, but any sort of sense for someone moves up of a PC and onto a tablet, what happens to sort of gigabyte demand if they go to a personal cloud or start storing things in the enterprise? Does that drive demand for more gigabytes or less or how should we think about that?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes, I think that in terms of the 5-millimeter, the thing that we have to keep in mind, and this is related to not only the 5-millimeter form factor but also as it relates to solid state hybrid drives, is that there are design windows to work with our customers on. And so we did not -- well first off, product is not generally available or shipping, it's still under development, but we are sampling with our customers. But we also have to hit the design time frames, design windows with our customers, and so that's why I go back to the point that we do not anticipate there being any shipment of those both from a development standpoint and from a design in perspective until the back half of 2013 with an all likelihood of being a more meaningful contributor in 2014. And so that's the 5-millimeter story, but we are encouraged with the progress that we're making and the interest on behalf of our customers. On the Connected Life, I mean, frankly, it's a little bit too early to call out specific data. And so -- but clearly one of the issues that's going on from a tablet perspective, I mean, tablet -- and I alluded to it in our prepared remarks, is that the storage capability on tablets is not that great, but yet the density, particularly, when you're talking about high def kind of content, video content, requires higher storage capacity and so, therefore, particularly as it relates to Win 8 and things like that or Android tablets is that they are USB enabled so that people can store more data on hard drives giving them, enabling them to access content at that higher video quality, thus increasing their experience from a consumer standpoint. But it's difficult to cite specific data as to how that plays out. But fundamentally, our job is to provide solutions to our consumers and to our customers that facilitates more and more data growth, and that's what we're trying to do.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I was hoping you could give us a little bit of detail on the different end markets in the past. I think you've given some comments about how those performed, so I was hoping you can give us some detail on the overall market.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "I can give you a few points. Like I said before, if you dissect the 136 for the December quarter, desktop was pretty much like we expected it somewhere in the 44.5 million range. Notebook was a little bit weaker than we expected because there was inventory rebalancing going on, but approximately the same 44.5 million to 45 million units. Enterprise was solid, 2 million quarter-over-quarter and improvement there to 15.5 million. I think, we're mostly through the inventory situation there. So that was solid. CE, which includes gaming, was about 15 million units and then branded products, like we said, and it's also driven by the desire to back up and attach DAS and NAS products was 15.5 million units or so, which was also very solid. And we have performed well in all of these areas. Our company share is about 44% and we have more or less around 40% to 46% in all of these areas. So that's pretty much the market, for example, last quarter.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, is there any extra inventory that you see in the various channels? I know you commented that disti is relatively lean, but we've had some inventory overhang. You've made some comments on the different segments. But just wanted to get an overall sense of work done with the inventory. And in the March quarter, do you expect to maintain your share? Or do you expect to lose or gain share?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes. So Sherri, I'll address the inventory and the share question. I think we said that the inventory rebalancing is largely complete, which means that it's not -- it's been reduced. There are small pockets, very small pockets. There's always small pockets where there might be some inventory corrections but nothing that we can tell and we don't have perfect visibility through all of the supply chain because it's not just our inventory or even our customers, it can be customers' inventory in the channel, but we don't believe there's anything meaningful from an inventory perspective. And then share, I mean, obviously our goal is to do the best job we can with our customers. And we believe that if we continue to do a great job with our customers, we're going to continue to do well from a share perspective, and where that leaves us, we'll have to kind of figure that out.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jayson Noland out of Robert Baird.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Steve, you mentioned better visibility, was that a comment on inventory? Or was there something more there?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Well, I think what was happening, as you go back to the past, I mean, the past several quarters, there was a much more meaningful overhang of inventory. The other thing is that we have to keep in mind is that our customers have been going through a significant product transition in terms of Windows 8, Windows 7, and then you got all the macroeconomic concerns and all the uncertainty associated with that. There wasn't -- I mean, so those things are beginning to lift. Accordingly, that gives us better visibility.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And there was some talk maybe a quarter or 2 ago about a 600 million TAM for cal '13 is that -- that seems tough, I guess, at this point?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, I mean, in Steve's remarks, he said that the first half of calendar '13 would be roughly flat to slightly down with the second half of calendar year '12, and I think there was 275 million or so. And then we feel cautiously optimistic about the second half of the calendar year, but will it give us a lift to 325? Probably not. So 600 seems like a high number at this point.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And last question for me, Wolfgang, as data storage slowly drifts towards the cloud in different applications at a different pace, could you talk about your enterprise business and the strength there? Are those cloud buyers or is that traditional enterprise? And what are the expectations going forward?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Well I think that, I mean, the primary area where we're seeing growth is in high-capacity enterprise and that's really across the board. I mean, obviously, and we don't talk specifically about customers and things like that. But generally, we're seeing strength across the board in that regard and so -- but the performance, traditional performance enterprise, is a pretty stable market, not necessarily anticipating there to be meaningful growth in that regard, but still a great part of the market for us and for the industry. And in terms of how we feel like we're positioned, we feel like we're very well positioned in multiple regards. We talked about where we have our existing products. We're very strong in terms of the enterprise SSD market, not necessarily that material within the whole grand scheme of things but certainly helps us from an overall portfolio perspective with our customers in terms of offering them solutions. And then with the introduction of the helium-filled drive and that innovation, we really feel very, very strong not only about our existing portfolio but about where we're going in the future.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Scott Craig of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Scott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Steve or Wolfgang, can you maybe talk about your utilization you think that you're running the factories at right now and maybe sort of the industry utilization. And then when do you expect to make decisions or the industry make decisions on how you should adjust capacity as you sort of head into the back part of the year. If things don't quite work out, how you're viewing them right now? And then along the lines of the CapEx, Wolfgang, why wouldn't CapEx be below the bottom end of the range given the significant, probably overcapacity, that's in the industry right now?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "I'll give you a few pointers and I'll let Steve add on. I mean, as Steve indicated earlier, with the volumes being lower, I mean, despite the fact that we are adjusting our capacity at a reasonable pace, you should assume that we have more capacity than we need at least in certain aspects of our business. It's always a little bit difficult to answer because it's not like one big box that you're utilizing, you have a wafer fab and you have HTA [ph] and you have media, et cetera. But you see that we're very, very active in rightsizing the capacity and I gave you the jobs that we took. So we're doing that in a reasonable, realtime fashion and that's one key contributor how we continue to stay in the margin model. In terms of capital, we're doing a capital spending as realtime as possible. We are focusing our capital spend entirely on areal density progression, on technology advancement, on supply flexibility. For instance, we had only one slide of app [ph] and now we have, I think, 2. So we're not investing in capacity. With the exception of test, as we move more into these capacity enterprise rise, they just require a longer test time, and those are the key components that made our capital spending, and we continue to do what we have always done. We will manage this very, very tightly and realtime.", "Operator", "It comes from Steven Fox from Cross Research.", "Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC", "Just 2 quick questions from me. Given the strength on the branded business in the fourth quarter and given how the floods may have affected your production during the year, is there any chance that may be you left some money on the table in terms of consumer demand with branded? And if so, is there any -- how would that impact this calendar year? And then secondly, just a little bit more color on enterprise, if possible. I'm just trying to get a sense for whether you're seeing enterprise demand that is seasonally in line with expectations above, below. Any kind of color there would help.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Can you clarify the question on leaving money on the table. I wasn't quite sure I...", "Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC", "Well, I'm wondering if you were able to meet demand on branded products across all your retail partners or whether maybe there was more demand at the end of the year that maybe you anticipated.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "I don't believe that was any issues with that, not to my knowledge. But if you know of anything, we'd be happy to support it. So and then I'm sorry, now, I got distracted on the second part of the question.", "Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC", "Yes, that's okay. I'm just trying to understand the March quarter seasonality on the enterprise class drives especially high-capacity drives. Are you seeing typical seasonality from your enterprise customers? Or is it better or worse start to the year?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, in general, what we expect for the March quarter, flat to slightly up. But again, if you look at this in the midterm, the capacity enterprise is what we believe is going to grow double-digit and the performance enterprise is more growing with the GDP at a lower rate.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with BMO.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "The first is on pricing. Within the guidance you've provided for the March quarter, could you talk specifically about what your expectations are for pricing. And then more importantly, as to extend Ananda's question, as you're thinking about the next couple of quarters, how are you thinking all the various forces will impact your pricing assumptions?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes. Like-for-like modest declines. It's still a competitive market. Our absolute price will be impacted by segment mix, and then going forward, it's a little bit tough to tell. I mean, we're looking at where we are as it relates to our business model and we're committed to be in the 27% to 32% range and that will govern our pricing.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Well, any responses -- Seagate specifically talked about pricing. They think it could indeed be flat sequentially for the next couple of quarters. Any reaction to those comments, specifically?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Well, I mean, you have to ask Seagate about that. I mean, obviously, we're trying to manage all the variables that we have, including pricing, to continue to improve our overall business performance and that sort of thing. We factored in some assumptions in terms of what will happen, and we'll have to see how that plays out in terms of how we move through the quarter, but I'm not going to comment specifically on Seagate's pricing.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Then more broadly my follow-up question, if I could, is you provided gross margin color for the near term March quarter. Could you just help us think about as you look, say, the June quarter or even within the March quarter, what are the -- outside of the pricing, what are the key areas that we should be really focused on or that you guys were focused on between mix and restructuring at Hitachi and the demand that would impact the gross margin to keep within the range that you've talked about?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Well, I think that there are a few key things. I mean, first off, we will be very careful about what business we take and what business we don't take and that sort of thing, so being selective within reason with regards to that. The other thing is to continue to manage our operations very closely from a cost and efficiency perspective and then particularly continuing to make improvements there. That's a very big opportunity for us across the board. And then the last thing which is what benefited this quarter is to continue to push our mix, both in terms of the capacity mix that we're shipping and selling but also in terms of the segment mix that we have overall. And again we do believe that the secular trends in that regard are moving in a positive direction. So we've got a little bit of wind at our back, if you want to call it that, in regards to that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the Nehal Chokshi with Technology Insight Research.", "Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC", "So in the industry segment detail that you gave us, looks like the enterprise hard drive segment increased about 15% Q-over-Q and your own enterprise hard drives increased 11% Q-over-Q. So can you just discuss what was the driver for the underperformance relative to the industry. And if possible, can you give us some additional detail on a subsegment basis on the relative performance. And I have another question about the Arkeia acquisition.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, I mean, on the enterprise, and we gave you rough numbers. Our enterprise market participation was as expected. There's always a little puts and takes, but our share is more or less flattish quarter-over-quarter.", "Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC", "Okay. All right. So this Arkeia acquisition looks like a nice acquisition that can build some value in the SMB segment and start to blur the lines at some of your enterprise customers. But in order to successfully do that, I think that you're going to have to build the brand value of Arkeia. So is that the intention of that acquisition? And if it is, can you discuss the investment that Western Digital is willing to make in order to build that value, that brand value, to realize full potential of this acquisition?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "First off, it was not a significant acquisition from a dollar amount perspective, but it does add the building block to our product capability in the SMB market and so really what we're trying to do is continue to improve our offering. And obviously, as we improve our offering, we're going to have to make other investments, prudent investments, to increase our presence in that marketplace. But this is -- we're just continuing to take it a step at a time in terms of enhancing our competitive position in that marketplace.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Ben Reitzes of Barclays Capital.", "Eric Sterling - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "This is Eric Sterling for Ben Reitzes. In light of your expectations for demand in the first half of the calendar year, are you backing away from the $10 EPS target that you had put out earlier in the year?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "That's a good -- that's a safe assumption, yes. I mean, we expect the $10 EPS target in the July time frame and at that time we were anticipating what we thought was -- frankly, was conservative for 5% growth in the market, which would have gotten you to some 630 million for the fiscal year. And when you do the math now based on what I -- what Steve said earlier, we'll probably land somewhere on 550 million, that's a very, very significant reduction in volume. What we have achieved with everything else was the product offering we achieved the gross margin models. But with a TAM that low, it's unrealistic and you can do the math, what we would have to achieve in Q4 so we don't think that's realistic anymore.", "Eric Sterling - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Right. And in terms of buybacks for the March quarter, how should we think about that?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "That's just -- we're executing to our capital allocation strategy which, as a reminder, called for 50% of the free cash flow to be spent on share buybacks and dividends, and we're going to execute into those metrics.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rob Cihra from Evercore Partners.", "Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Two questions, if I could. One, Steve, you had talked about the visibility getting better now that inventories have been worked down, which makes sense because at least you get a truer view in the demand. But can you talk about your OEM customer visibility? My sense is that they don't normally have a lot of visibility this time of the year, and that this year it may even be worse than usual. I mean, do you get a sense that they have any visibility past, say, February. And are your comments of visibility actually implying that maybe their visibility is starting to get a little better here too or where do they look. And then separate from that, just a question on branded, your branded business is getting back to where it was pre-flood. You said inventories were lean there. Wondering if you're still sort of catching up, if you've caught up? And what do we need to see to get that market back to being a good growth market like it had been pre-flood?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "I think it's difficult for me to comment specifically on the customers have better visibility. I mean, the reality of things from a customer perspective is that there's still a fair amount of cautiousness out there, conservatism, if you want to call it that. I mean, it's been a tough year and there's a lot of transitions going on but I think that -- and obviously there are, and this is always true, but maybe particularly given now there's always winners and losers, if you want to call it that, and so depends upon who you talk to and their level of confidence. But I think when we evaluate demand, we obviously don't, and no disrespect to our customers, we don't just listen to our customers. There's lots of things we triangulate to try to get a sense for where we think things are going to fall out. And it's those things, coupled with conversations with customers and to your point, the easing of the inventory overhang that gives us increased visibility and confidence with regards to how we see things playing out.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "And I can answer the branded question. I mean, last quarter, the market for branded was higher than pre-flood. So that market was totally recovered and if you recall from our September Analyst Day and Investor Day, branded is clearly one of the areas along with capacity enterprise where we believe we will see solid growth for the coming years, both on the DAS and the NAS side and that's driven by the desire and need to backup and, it's also driven by the data growth in general.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Miller of Noble Financial Capital Market.", "Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "One thing that you seem to be a doing a very good job on is keeping your markets up, ASPs were flat this quarter, the channel has also been lean as you noted. Is there reason to believe there are other factors just besides behaving well in terms of internal cost cuts and reducing your cost per prime unit that will also support higher margins in 2013? I know they went up significantly after the acquisition of Hitachi, but there were a lot of moving parts there with the flood, and I was expecting I think you said we can't expect that to come down.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes, I think, Mark, just to kind of comment on that, there's always multiple levers that we have to influence our business outcome. And I know that a lot of times the market, and I'm referring to, call it, Wall Street in this case, will focused on one particular variable or what have you or whether it be demand, or it be pricing data points that are out there and say, well, you know, margins must be going down or this creates this kind of problem. And we obviously have a very holistic way in terms of the way that we manage our business and a lot of levers that we can pull, including improving our cost, improving our mix. The selection of what business we accept or don't accept with our customers and then obviously pricing. So there's lots of different things that we can do. And to your indication or to your point, we do believe that we've done a reasonably good job, and that's reflected in our gross margin performance and not only that, our guidance, and we expect to continue to do that going forward. And that's why we've stated the fact that we're confident that we're going to continue to stay within this gross margin range of 27 to 32, and that it's not just a set of aspirational goals. It's the way that we're going to manage the business.", "Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "Because of the flood, your competitor signed up a number of its customers to long-term agreements, and it seems to me a lot of these agreements should be patiently done with. And I'm just wondering are these agreements expiring or are there opportunities for you as these agreements expire or these agreements are still -- some of these agreements are extending well into 2013?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes, just to correct one thing, Mark. We did not sign or have a lot of -- we didn't have any meaningful, if you want to call it, LTAs with our customers. So this is based upon -- there's no contractual lockup, if you want to call it here, that's compelling our customers to pay us higher prices than otherwise they would desire. This is just good old hard work in the way that we're dealing with our customers and how we're managing our business.", "Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "Well my point was more with your competitor, which had stated...", "Stephen D. Milligan", "I'm sorry, with our competitor. Yes, I mean, those have been expired. We don't have all the details, but they've been expiring over time and you'd have to ask Seagate more details about it.", "All right, I'd like to thank you again for joining us. In closing, I also want to thank all Western Digital employees for their dedication and outstanding performance and our customers and our suppliers for their support.

I'd like to take this opportunity to let you know that we plan to hold our annual Investor Day meeting on May 8, 2013, and our second quarter results conference call on Wednesday, July 17, 2013. With that, I will turn the call over to Sanjay.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report a record first quarter revenue for Q1 2013, with our performance driven by robust sales of SSD products, which drove 20% of our sales, and by strengthening our retail channel, which also set a revenue record for the first quarter. Our results demonstrate substantial progress and continued diversification of our portfolio driven by growth in SSDs and the broadening range of embedded solutions.", "We believe our first quarter achievements have positioned the company well for continued gains on multiple fronts throughout 2013. Starting with the specifics of the first quarter, I'm happy to report that combined sales of Client and Enterprise solid state drives tripled year-over-year.", "For the client market, we have begun revenue shipment of our new 19-nanometer SSDs to the retail and B2B channels. We are also in various stages of OEM customer qualifications with our 19-nanometer Client SSD, and we expect to begin revenue shipments late in the second quarter. The Client SSD market continues to grow, driven by improving attached rates to our [indiscernible] in PCs, and SanDisk continues to gain share and momentum in this market.", "SanDisk is particularly well positioned to benefit from 5x5 caching and standalone SSDs, both of which we supply to the vast majority of leading PC OEMs. Our Enterprise SSDs also posted strong year-over-year and sequential growth, setting a second consecutive record for quarterly revenue. In the first quarter, for the first time, the majority of our Enterprise SSD revenue was derived using captive memory supply. These products are built with our 24-nanometer memory, and we expect to launch our next-generation SaaS and PCIe SSDs manufactured on our 19-nanometer technology in the second half of this year.", "In the mobile market, we achieved strong year-over-year growth in our embedded sales as our portfolio offered a wide array of solutions to our customers. Design wins incorporating iNAND MCP, which is our iNAND embedded flash drive packaged with mobile DRAM, continue to increase to address the growing market for budget smartphones. We are also successfully extending our removable product segmentation strategy to embedded solutions as reflected in the most recent announcement of reference design win for the iNAND Extreme Embedded Flash Drive with NVIDIA's Tegra processor for tablets. In the first quarter, the combined sales of our iNAND discrete and iNAND MCP product lines increased substantially on a year-over-year basis.", "Turning to mobile cards, we achieved significant progress in establishing the high-performance mobile card category in the retail channel with our branded Ultra microSD cards. In particular, due to the rapidly expanding base of Android devices, the majority of which also have card slots, we leveraged our broad market presence to drive strong growth in unit sales of our SanDisk Ultra mobile cards. This product line now represents an increasing mix of our mobile cards sold through retail. I would also like to point out that as the rate of card bundling with mobile devices and OEMs have declined, we have seen sustained increases in mobile card sales through the retail channel and at substantially higher average capacities.", "Overall, in the retail channel, we achieved record first quarter revenue performance driven by market share gain and very strong year-over-year revenue growth from imaging and mobile cards, as well as from USB flash drives across all regions.", "Additionally, the revenue mix of our high-performance products in retail increased by nearly 20 percentage points to over 40%. Our broad global footprint, diversified product portfolio and brand strength are key differentiators for our global retail offering and together represents a unique competitive advantage for the company.", "Turning to manufacturing, our 19-nanometer technology remains the dominant production node in the first quarter and we anticipate continued high usage of 19-nanometer technology throughout 2013. We expect to begin initial production of 1Y nanometer technology late in the third quarter. We will review more details related to our 1Y and future technologies during our upcoming Investor Day on May 8.", "Looking at supply bit growth estimates, we continue to believe that the 2013 industry supply bit growth rate will be in the range of 30% to 40% and that our captive supply bit growth will be meaningfully below that range. We expect a healthy demand-and-supply balance and a favorable pricing environment in 2013. We have decided not to add new wafer capacity in Phase I of Fab 5 during the remainder of 2013. Instead, concentrating our efforts on completing the remaining 19-nanometer transition, beginning the 1Y nanometer transition and making continued improvement in fab productivity.", "Given the increased manufacturing equipment requirements of 1Y, we expect to utilize the remainder of the clean room space in Phase I of Fab 5 to continue the 1Y transition in the 3 Yokkaichi fabs. We expect that the Phase I Fab 5 clean room will be approximately 75% full by the end of this year and ultimately will be completely filled by the equipment required for the Yokkaichi 1Y transition.", "We continue to make good progress in our 3-pronged memory technology strategy, which includes cleaner NAND scaling, 3D Bics NAND and 3D resistive RAM. As we consider future clean room space requirements, we will need additional space to complete the 1Y technology transition and to enable transitions to 1Z nanometer for Fab 3, Fab 4 and Phase I of Fab 5 and potentially for Bics NAND technology as well, once it is ready for manufacturing. While we have not made a final decision, we now expect to begin construction of the Fab 5 Phase II shell sometime in the second half of this year, with construction expected to take 7 quarters. Phase II of Fab 5 is not expected to contribute any meaningful incremental wafer capacity for SanDisk in 2014.", "In closing, we ended the first quarter of 2013 in a position of increased competitive and financial strength. Our markets remain healthy, growth drivers are diverse and strong, and we remain focused on prudently managing our capacity, driving profitable growth and creating shareholder value. I look forward to meeting many of you at our Annual Investor Day on May 8. With that, I will turn the call over to Judy for her financial review and outlook.", "Judy Bruner", "Thank you, Sanjay. Our strong first quarter results reflect the benefit of our broadening product portfolio and our disciplined capacity management. The key highlights of the quarter included our SSD product revenue, which grew over 200% on a year-over-year basis, and the continued strengthening of our global retail channels which produced year-over-year revenue growth of 34%.", "Our record first quarter revenue grew 11% year-over-year, with petabytes sold up 36% and ASP per gigabyte down 18% from Q1 last year. Sequentially, revenue was seasonally down 13% with petabytes sold down 16% and ASP per gigabyte up 2%, reflecting strong supply-demand balance and an improving product mix. This is the first time in our history that ASP per gigabyte has gone up sequentially for 2 quarters in a row.", "Our Q1 blended price increase was driven by an increased sales mix of SSDs, as well as real price increases in several parts of our business, partially offset by a decline in the ASP of our retail sales due to mix. Our retail channel ASP declined sequentially due to a seasonally lower mix of imaging cards, a higher mix of USB sales and emerging markets business and also due to the strong growth in the average capacity of our retail products. While our overall blended retail ASP was down sequentially due to these mix factors, we did raise ASPs for many of the retail product lines, and retail delivered strong gross margin in Q1.", "As I described last quarter, we are now reporting the channel mix of our revenue as retail and commercial. The commercial channel includes OEM customers, B2B customers, direct enterprise customers and licensees. Our total Q1 revenue was 62% commercial and 38% retail, reflecting a year-over-year mix shift toward retail of 6 percentage point driven by our strong growth in that channel.", "Our first quarter commercial revenue grew year-over-year by 1% to $829 million with product revenue up $2 million and license and royalty revenue up $3 million. Within commercial product revenue, SSDs produced the strongest growth and embedded sales grew 30% year-over-year. The growth from SSDs and embedded products was largely offset by a continued decline in OEM bundled card revenue as well as a shift away from white label OEM cards and wafers in order to prioritize memory supply for SSDs and embedded.", "Our license and royalty revenue was over $102 million, reflecting a seasonally strong Q4 for flash sales and also benefiting from higher one-time payments from system licensees, partially offset by a continuing decline in royalties related to the card market.", "Our first quarter retail revenue grew 34% year-over-year to $512 million with the highest dollar growth coming from mobile cards. As Sanjay described, we believe that consumers are increasing their purchases of retail mobile cards due to the limited card bundling by OEMs, and our leading retail presence enables us to fulfill a large share of this demand, which tends to be higher-capacity and higher-performance cards than in the bundled market. The average capacity of our mobile retail cards in Q1 was over 11 gigabytes compared to less than 6 gigabytes for mobile cards in the commercial channel. Our year-over-year retail sales growth was also very strong for USB drives, client SSDs and imaging cards, and regionally, our retail revenue delivered substantial year-over-year growth in all major regions.", "Our non-GAAP gross margin increased from 39.9% in Q4 to 40.5% in Q1. Our product gross margin remained approximately constant sequentially, with license and royalty revenue driving the sequential increase in total gross margin. Both our ASP per gigabyte and our cost per gigabyte increased 2% sequentially, with the increase in both metrics driven largely by product mix.", "Looking at the components of our product costs, our flash memory cost per gigabyte improved modestly, with this sequential improvement more than offset by an increase in our non-flash cost per gigabyte. Our mix of 19-nanometer and X3 memory remained approximately constant on a sequential basis with the improvement in our flash memory costs driven by the usage of higher average capacity die and a slight improvement in our yen rate from 79 to 81. So far, almost all of our SSD products sold have been manufactured using 24-nanometer technology. As we begin to transition our OEM client SSDs to 19-nanometer late in Q2, as Sanjay described, we will have more opportunity to increase the 19-nanometer mix, which will contribute to cost reduction.", "The increase in our non-flash cost per gigabyte came primarily from an increased sales mix of SSD and MCP products. In comparison to our traditional product mix, SSDs carry a higher cost on a cost [ph] per gigabyte basis for non-flash cost such as those related to transformation and test and the controller and PCB materials. And, of course, our MCP products carry a higher non-flash cost due to the non-captive mobile DRAM.", "On a year-over-year basis, our non-GAAP gross margin increased by almost 500 basis points, with cost per gigabyte down 24% compared to the 18% decline in price per gigabyte. Our Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses were $255 million, equal to our previous forecast. The sequential increase in R&D expense came primarily from SSD development and memory technology and design. Sales and marketing expenses were sequentially down due to seasonally lower spending on branding and merchandising.", "Our Q1 non-GAAP operating margin was a healthy 21.5% and the non-GAAP tax rate was 29%, including a one-time Q1 benefit from the retroactive passage of the 2012 R&D tax credit. Our diluted share count increased sequentially by 1.4 million shares as option exercises and employee stock purchases outweighed our increased share repurchases during Q1.", "On the balance sheet, gross cash and marketable securities increased in Q1 by almost $500 million to nearly $6.2 billion, bringing net cash to over $4.2 billion. Our inventory balance decreased modestly in Q1, and we are supply-constrained in several areas. With solid profits and strong balance sheet management, cash flow from operations in Q1 was $474 million, our highest ever first quarter cash flow from operations. And we also received $54 million of repayments from the joint ventures. We spent $48 million of cash on property and equipment during Q1, primarily for test equipment and facilities outfitting, and our share of joint venture fab investments was approximately $50 million which was funded by the joint ventures.", "The joint ventures did not take out any new leases during Q1, and our share of off-balance sheet lease obligations was reduced to $743 million. We spent $90 million on share repurchases during Q1 to repurchase 1.76 million shares at an average price of $50.97.", "I'll now turn to forward-looking commentary. Based on our decision to add no new wafer capacity beyond productivity improvements in 2013, we expect to be supply-constrained for the remainder of the year. We anticipate a very modest level of price decline in 2013 due to our expectation of continuing favorable supply-demand balance coupled with an increased year-over-year mix of SSD and embedded product sales, as well as high-performance retail product sales. We expect our second quarter revenue to be between $1.35 billion and $1.4 billion. This is the narrow range reflecting supply constraints and also a sequentially lower level of SSD revenue in the second quarter due to lumpiness in the timing of sales to certain customers. For the full year, we are raising our estimated revenue range to $5.6 billion to $5.75 billion.", "We expect our second quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be 41% to 43%, reflecting the positive impact from our hedged yen rate of approximately 86 compared to 81 in the first quarter, partially offset by a lower mix of license and royalty revenue as card market royalties continue to decline and without the benefit of certain one-time royalties in Q1. We expect gross margins to increase further in the second half of the year, and we are raising our estimate of full year 2013 non-GAAP gross margin to 42% to 44% with the midpoint 200 basis points higher than our previous estimate. The increase in our 2013 gross margin range is due primarily to our expectation of a continued strong pricing environment and a weaker yen in the second half, and also takes into account increases in demand mix and costs for certain embedded products such as MCPs, which we have developed for our strategic customers and that have a lower-than-average gross margin. With respect to the yen, we have locked in approximately half of the purchases that will impact our Q3 cost of sales at a yen rate of approximately 95. The second half of our Q3 and all of our Q4 yen-based cost of sales are unhedged and subject to market exchange rates.", "I want to elaborate a bit further on the yen and describe 2 factors which are reducing the future impact of changes in the yen exchange rate on our gross margins. First, as the yen continues to weaken, the yen-based proportion of our cost of sales is naturally shrinking. Second, with our mix of sales evolving toward products that have a higher proportion of non-flash costs, this is also reducing the yen-based proportion in our cost of sales. Because of these 2 factors, the impact of a 10% movement in the yen to dollar exchange rate is currently about 300 basis points in our gross margins compared to our previous estimate of 400 basis points.", "In summary, the midpoint of our 2013 non-GAAP gross margin of 42% to 44% has increased by approximately 900 basis points from 2012.", "Turning to expenses, we continue to expect 2013 non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $1.05 billion, with Q2 expenses forecasted at approximately $260 million. And we expect the non-GAAP tax rate for the remainder of the year to be approximately 32%, 1 point higher than our previous forecast due to stronger profitability.", "Our stock price is now above the $52.37 conversion price of our 2017 convertible debt. While we hedge the conversion price to approximately $73, accounting rules require us to include potential dilution from the 2017 convertible debt in our diluted shares without an offset from the hedge. We expect to continue utilizing our share repurchase plan in Q2. However, we now expect our diluted share count to increase sequentially by approximately 2 million shares in Q2 due to the convertible debt accounting. We plan to spend quite a bit more on share repurchases in 2013 than we did in 2012, with the objective to at least offset dilution from employee incentive awards.", "We expect 2013 capital investments to be similar to our previous estimates, and I will share more details on our capital investments at our May 8 Investor Day. One last comment related to the balance sheet and use of cash is the reminder that in Q2, the first of our convertible debt offerings will mature and we will utilize $928 million of cash to pay off the remaining principal. We do not expect to issue any shares in connection with the retirement of this convertible debt.", "In closing, we are pleased with our strong first quarter results and expect to deliver further growth across the year in both revenue and profitability. We will now open the call for your questions.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Judy. Thank you, Sanjay. Aaron, can you open the floor for questions, please?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Sanjay, I wondered if you could talk a little bit, now that you've made the decision not to move forward with additional wafer starts in 2013, what were the puts and takes behind that? Was that really a function of looking at shrinks that could get you the capacity you needed? Was it more of a view on the supply-demand environment for the overall industry? And just remind us the bit growth you're targeting this year and how we should think about 2014.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "The bit growth that we are looking at this year, as we have said, for the industry is in the range of 30% to 40%, and the SanDisk bit growth is meaningfully less than the industry number that we have given you. Our decisions regarding growing our bits during 2013 are certainly, first, very much focused on technology transitions because technology transitions really give you the lowest cost and most efficient way of growing the bits and toward the maximum -- the investments made in technology transitions toward the maximum ROI on the longer term. So we prefer technology transitions to drive bit growth.", "When we look at capacity additions, the decisions that we really need to consider there for new capacity are, of course, the demands, trends projected for the business and the industry environment, including the pricing environment that is expected in the future, the center of our technology transitions, the technology roadmap of the future, as well as the ROI on the new investments we made in new capacity. And regarding the ROI for new investments and new capacity, at this point, it is very important to assess that carefully because NAND's future technology roadmap beyond 1Z is certainly -- is not certain, and the 3D technologies of the future are in -- still in early stages of development. It's not clear that how much of the toolset of those 3D technologies will be usable. It will be common with the NAND memory production. Therefore -- and the 3D technology in there also, 2 to 3 years away from any meaningful production. That's why it's very important to assess the ROI on any new capacity at this point, and we continue to favor investments in new -- in technology transitions for growing our bits. We feel very comfortable with the plans that we have for capacity this year and our technology transition status for the future, together with our focus on continuing to strengthen the mix of our business in terms of driving toward higher value solutions such as solid state drives, embedded solutions, as well as our high-margin retail businesses.", "John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Helpful, Sanjay. And I guess as my follow-up for either you or for Judy, you guys talked a little bit about your pricing expectations for all of 2013. Just kind of curious, given that we've just gone through what's normally the seasonally weak period for pricing in the NAND market with much better results in the March quarter than normal, how do you think pricing trends from here on a sequential basis?", "Judy Bruner", "I don't want to give any specific projections of pricing on a quarterly basis, but I would say that our expectations are that the level of price decline this year in the industry will be lower than we've ever seen before in the history of this industry. And so we believe that, coupled even with much lower bit growth than we've also seen before is allowing us to strengthen our business in terms of growing the top line and growing the bottom line and delivering strong cash flow. So we really feel very good about the business model that we're able to drive even with much more modest bit growth given this pricing environment. And clearly, we think our disciplined approach to capacity management plays a key part in this.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company.", "Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Can you give us what the absolute wafer start capacity assumption is for the up [ph] 30% to 40% industry bit growth?", "Judy Bruner", "Well, I don't want to necessarily give a total industry wafer capacity. I think you can find some of those numbers out there. But I will tell you that our own wafer capacity today is a little below 2.5 million wafers per year. And through productivity improvements that we are working on this year, which includes installing some bottleneck tools, we expect to be able to exit this year at about 2.6 million wafers per year capacity.", "Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Great. And then just second question on quadbit, we've heard that you're shipping some of these into the market. Can you just talk a little bit about is that just another way for you to meet demand without adding wafers? And is that targeted at a particular market?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "I'm not very sure what you mean by quadbit. In case you meant for 4-bit per cell, like X4 technology that we had in the past, I want to be clear that we are not shipping any quadbit products today. All of our memory production is 2-bit and 3-bit per cell technology, what is commonly referred to as X2 and X3. And we lead the industry in 3-bit per cell X3 production. And there is no quadbit, if that means 4-bit per cell technology, in the industry and production. The applications that the marketplace has today require very high performance, high reliability from memory technology and memory product solutions, and the technologies that are most suitable to address the industry applications, industry demand drivers today are X2-based and X3-based technologies and products.", "Operator", "We'll go next to James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Thanks very much for the clarity on the Fab 5 plans. Related to that, though, could you help us understand by the end of this year, exiting the year, either on a bit shipments or on a wafer starts basis, what proportion of your capacity will have been shifted to 1Y technology?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "1Y technology will start production in the third quarter. And even in the fourth quarter, the 1Y production level will be very small to really call out, so 1Y technology contribution for 2013 wafer output will be very small. And as a percentage of our total -- of our production exiting the year also, it will be small. 1Y will be ramping up primarily during the course of 2014 and perhaps some in 2015 timeframe as well.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, obviously, there are a lot of moving parts, as you mentioned, in terms of your cost per bit reduction because of the mix of SSD changing up and down. Can you help us understand what the expectation should be for cost-per-bit declines for maybe this next quarter and for the broader year if we exclude Japanese yen effect?", "Judy Bruner", "Exclude the Japanese yen. So the cost per bit improvement this year, I believe, will be lower than we've ever seen before, similar to my comment that the decline in price per gigabyte, I believe, will also be lower than we've ever seen before.", "And as you just saw in the first quarter that we reported, our cost per gigabyte actually went up 2%, driven largely by product mix. So the factors that are going to impact our cost-per-gigabyte improvement this year, and I do believe we will have improvement on a year-over-year basis, are that we will have some modest amount of technology transition primarily coming from continuing the remaining amount of 19-nanometer transition, very little, if any impact, in cost of sales from 1Y production this year. And that technology transition impact coming primarily from 19-nanometer will be offset somewhat by a decreasing X3 mix in terms of our output given the product requirements for the demand that we see this year, and it will be also offset somewhat by the increasing mix of products that we're selling that have increased non-flash contents, such as SSDs and MCPs. So those are some of the key factors and the -- and, of course, the yen is helping the cost improvement. But even with the inclusion of the benefit of the yen, I still expect that our improvement in overall cost per gigabyte will be very much below the levels we've seen in the past.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.", "Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division", "Sanjay, oftentimes pricing this robust has encouraged manufacturers to add more capacity. Your outlook for industry bit growth this year is flat versus 3 months ago. What do you see out there that gives you confidence that competitors are going to stay fairly disciplined with capacity growth?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "I think, certainly over the course of last several quarters, if you look at the industry trend, there has been disciplined exercise, I believe, in the industry for adding capacity. The demand drivers continue to grow very well in the industry. Looking at the future, the smartphones, tablets and SSDs, and Client computing as well as Enterprise continue to drive the demand side very well. And on the supply side, certainly, I can speak for our sales reps in attendance that the technology challenges are getting more and more complex. What you gain from technology transition in terms of gigabytes per wafer is reducing, as well as the capital intensity, for example, for 1Y node, is increasing. So then, one has to definitely be looking than making decisions on new capacity additions, as I mentioned before, has to be looking at ROI consideration. That's what we focus on. And that, in light of the increasing complexity of the technology and uncertainty of NAND scaling. And while before 3D in the industry becomes meaningful production, it really needs to be assessed very carefully and that's how we look at it. And I believe those are the kind of factors that are common to the rest of the industry as well.", "Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division", "That's very helpful. And then as a follow-up question for either you or Judy, the company had established a product mix target for the SSD business of 25% of sales for next year. You're already at 20%. Should we be revisiting that target and can you really get to a 25% level or even higher potentially this year with SSD?", "Judy Bruner", "So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we do expect that we will see some decline in our Client SSD revenue from Q1 to Q2 due to the lumpiness of sales to certain customers. So we continue to believe that we will be able to do more than 15% mix of SSDs this year in 2013. And at present, our objective for 2014 remains at 25% or more.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I had a question on margins, Judy, and I just want to make sure I was clear on it. So the yen impact is reduced because of the non-flash component growing. I just want to understand, that's for this year that's based on the 50% SSD. Does that become a headwind next year as well, as SSD goes to 25%, and I mean headwind to margins?", "Judy Bruner", "So I want to be clear that the diminishing impact of a movement in the yen-to-dollar exchange rate is due to 2 factors. And one is the increasing non-flash memory content of our products, such as SSDs and MCPs. And the other is actually the weakening of the yen itself. As the yen becomes weaker and weaker, of course, then that lowers the proportion of our cost structure that comes from yen. And so both of those factors lead to a lower mix of our cost of sales being yen-based. And therefore, when the yen moves further, it has a dampening effect on the impact. But I wouldn't necessarily call it a headwind. I mean, we still are getting favorable benefit from the weakening yen. I just wanted to clarify that it's not quite as much of an impact as we had measured last quarter when we were measuring an impact of the yen going from a 2012 rate of 79 to a rate at the time which was in the sort of 85 to 90 kind of range. And then since then, the yen has continued to weaken further.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. And the follow-up is a quicker one. What's the mix between Client and Enterprise in your SSD business?", "Judy Bruner", "We haven't broken that down specifically, but we have said that the Client SSD revenue is a bigger portion of our SSD revenue today.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.", "Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Just to go back to the 1Y dynamic in terms of increased capital intensity, how much more is it relative to, say, 19-nanometer previous nodes and how much more will it be when you go to 1Z, if you do go to 1Z?", "Judy Bruner", "So the increased capital requirements for a tech transition to go to 1Y as compared to 19 is actually significantly higher in terms of CapEx, and we would -- we're going to provide more granular detail on this at our Investor Day because it provides a -- it takes a little more time to explain the details of this and provide the context. I will tell you that when we go to 1Z, 1Z also will have a high capital requirement for a tech transition as compared to what we've seen in the past. However, we do believe that the 1Z capital requirement will be a little bit less than the 1Y capital requirement. But both will be high as compared to what we've seen as historical norms.", "Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and then as a quick follow-up. In terms of 3D technologies, I think Sanjay mentioned that it's 2 or 3 years out. Could it be more than that? Is that an industry kind of observation or is that specific to SanDisk?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "I believe that meaningful production of 3D technology and here I'm, of course, referring to BiCS kind of 3D NAND technologies, meaningful production is 2 to 3 years out. Of course, some pilot line level of production can begin earlier because that what it would take to demonstrate the viability of the technology. But any meaningful production in 2 to 3 years away in the industry because meaningful production requires not just a technology. It requires all the application, all the system-level solution to be ready and for the technology to be adopted by the host of applications that exist out there. And if we speak about 3D resistive RAM technology, that is farther out. It is still in very early stages of development. And as we have said before, it requires EUV technology and EUV technology from becoming really cost-effective for byte adoption and production is also a few years away. So 3D NAND technologies in the industry, I believe, 2 to 3 years away before they become meaningful.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Bob Gujavarty with Deutsche Bank.", "Bobby Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I was just curious a little bit about the SSD business, really strong performance, above seasonal in 1Q. How do you characterize kind of the 2Q pause? Is it more attach rates are kind of plateauing before they start going up again? Is it a qualification issue where you're trying to qualify some more 1Y products? Just, if you could characterize a little bit of the speed bump in 2Q.", "Judy Bruner", "I would characterize it as really just a timing of the sales to a customer, and it's a large customer for us. It's not really a speed bump in terms of demand in the overall marketplace.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "But actually it's for SSDs in laptops and PCs really continue to build up very nicely. New platforms are being designed with Haswell processors. You know this will come out later in the second half of the year, and SanDisk is well-positioned in SSD business and we continue to gain share in this market.", "Bobby Gujavarty - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Maybe a quick follow-up, then. Maybe what would you kind of estimate the kind of the attached rates are today and how does that look out over the course of the rest of the year from your perspective?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "I think about, if you look at 2012 numbers and the third-party reports, about 10% of the total notebook had SSDs or flash in them. And that number is increasing dramatically. I think total Client SSD demand last year was like 50 million units, this year increasing to 80 million units. So this continue to increase rapidly in 3 to 4 year timeframe, I think by 2015, 2016 timeframe, third-party reports show that increasing to about 35% or so.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Just a clarification from the last question. When you talked about attach rate, was it pure SSDs or pure -- all, including pure and dual drive or hybrid, both [ph] ?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Anything that is using flash.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Would you -- could you share like what do you think the transition of pure SSDs could do over the next 3 or 4 years?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Pure SSDs are definitely continuing to increase nicely, and that's where actually there's a very strong penetration ahead for pure SSDs. SanDisk is a supplier of a standalone SSDs, what you refer to as pure SSDs, as well as caching solutions. The bigger growth, the bigger attach rate is in the standalone SSD area. Caching solutions also continue to be a large part of the market, and in 2013 and 2014 timeframe certainly, they'll continue to be growing as well.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Just a last question here. ESMO [ph] talked about that they expect NAND capacity orders in second half. They put some number to it, 100,000 as a start, which is about 10% of industry capacity. So are you taking this kind of number in your expectations when you guide to 30% to 40% bit supply growth for industry in 2013?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So for 2013, the 30% to 40% bit growth for the industry, our estimations do include certain level of capacity additions in the industry. And let me just point out that demand drivers for flash are very strong and are projected to be strong in the future years as well. And that, at some point, will certainly require new capacity addition in the industry. And, of course, those capacity additions have to be looked at from the point of view of ROI which, as I mentioned before, needs to be assessed very carefully. But when you look at demand trends and look at the capacity projections in the industry, I believe that there will be a continuing healthy demand-supply balance in the industry, not only in 2013 timeframe but also in 2014 timeframe.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.", "Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I want to make sure I understand the SSD cost and margin issues. Can you talk about where SSD margins are relative to the corporate average? Are they a little higher, a lot higher? And then can you clarify the cost issue, what are the non-NAND cost that we should be focused on?", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. In the Enterprise SSD business, the gross margins that we're generating in that business now are definitely above our corporate average. In fact, they are the higher -- highest gross margins in terms of our different product categories, especially now that we've transitioned the majority of our Enterprise SSDs to our own captive flash. In terms of Client SSDs, those gross margins tend to be around the corporate average. So in terms of the higher cost that we mentioned a couple of times and I think you're questioning about, SSDs have a higher cost per gigabyte than our traditional products. They also have a higher price per gigabyte than our traditional products. So as the mix shifts to more SSDs in our business, it dampens the cost-per-gigabyte improvement metric. It also dampens the price-per-gigabyte improvement metric. So both of those metrics get influenced quite a bit now by the changing mix of our products business. But -- so don't be mistaken and think that SSDs are reducing gross margins. It's just that they change those 2 metrics quite a bit. And then they also tend to have higher non-flash memory cost, non-flash costs on a cost-per-gigabyte basis because they have higher cost for transformation, assembly and test. They have higher cost in terms of things like the controller cost and the PCB. So that's really another factor in the cost.", "Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, that's very helpful. And you said both cost and price per gigabit will be higher. Is the gross margin dollar-per-gigabit higher than corporate average?", "Judy Bruner", "Yes, they generate strong gross margin dollars, yes, on a per-gigabyte basis.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Steven Fox with Cross Research.", "Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC", "Two questions. First of all, I just wanted to clarify some of the comments about the yen for the second half of the year. You said that you're looking at it being unhedged later in Q3 and Q4. Is that sort of locked in that you're going to leave it that way or could you pursue some sort of hedging strategy that you just haven't come to a conclusion on? And then secondly, just looking -- just to round out the conversation on the mix. Given the weaker mix in this quarter and given some of the trends you talked about for the second half of the year, can you sort of walk through how the mix should improve second half of the year versus the first quarter? It seems like it can get better in the second half of the year versus what you just did. And what other the things you should look out as sort of caution against the mix improving from these levels?", "Judy Bruner", "Okay. So first, on the question about hedging of the yen, we are monitoring this on a really day-by-day basis as we go. We have been purchasing our yen more frequently than in the past in order to try to benefit from or to average the changes in the cost, and we have been purchasing a little bit ahead but not too far ahead. And so that's why as I've said, we have locked in half of the wafer purchases that we estimate will impact our Q3 cost of sales but not beyond that. We could decide, at some point, to change that approach and to hedge or lock in more. But so far, that has been what we've done. And generally, we have believed so far that there is not that much risk of a big appreciation in the yen, and therefore, we have not locked in too far into the future. But we could change that at any point in time, and we're always monitoring the situation. Your second question was about a weaker mix in the first quarter and might it improve in the second half. And I'm not...", "Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC", "Well, weaker mix in the second quarter from the first quarter. So I guess, my basic question is the mix in the first quarter, it seems like there's an opportunity for the mix to get even better or more favorable for gross margins in the second half of the year versus what you just posted in the first quarter, even that though there's a step back in Q2. And I was wondering if you could just sort of discuss that possibility.", "Judy Bruner", "Well, I wouldn't necessarily call the second quarter a weaker mix than the first quarter. What I said is that we expect Client SSD revenue to be somewhat less in the second quarter than in the first quarter, but I also said that Client SSDs tend to have a gross margin around the corporate average. So in that regard, I wouldn't necessarily call it a weaker mix one way or the other in terms of the impact on gross margin. Is that what you're asking or something else?", "Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC", "Well, actually what I'm getting at is just if I look at the second half of the year, kind of it seems like there's opportunities for the mix to improve further given how strong of a start SSD demand is and how you're improving on the Enterprise side with some of the new product introductions and also what you mentioned about retail.", "Judy Bruner", "We would expect to continue to be able to grow our Enterprise SSD business, and our retail business is generally stronger in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year. So in both of those areas, yes, that has been built-in to our expectation for both revenue and for gross margin for the year.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets.", "Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "To better understand what's happening in the business, Judy, can you share with us what you're seeing in terms of the ASPs in terms of the profile? What is -- last year, we saw real divergence, I believe, in the market where high-quality bits were very expensive and retail low-quality bits were very inexpensive. Can you talk about what you've seen this quarter? Is that range tightening? Can you share with us maybe what the most expensive bit is selling for and what the lowest cost bit is selling for and how that's changed?", "Judy Bruner", "I would say our retail products actually command a very strong price per gigabyte. So I think when you are talking about these big divergences and you mention retail, I think you're talking more about what's being sold on the spot market in terms of components or cards sold to a white-label provider or wafer prices sold on the spot market. And actually, we, as I mentioned, have pulled away somewhat and we've reduced our supply allocation to those markets in order to prioritize our supply to market, such as embedded products and SSD products, as well as our branded retail where we command a strong price premium.", "Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "So, I mean, is my takeaway that you've not seen a very big divergence or a big range in ASPs achieved in the different end markets?", "Judy Bruner", "There actually are relatively strong prices available today in the spot market because of the tight supply-demand balance in the industry. So in that regard, I would suggest maybe the difference that you're speaking of from past year that, that difference has been reduced because of the tight supply-demand environment.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "And I would just say that the pricing environment is healthy in all segments, that flash memory as of today.", "Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "All right, terrific. If I could move on to another point, can you discuss with us what your strategy is in terms of controllers in your SSDs? What percentage presently are shipping with controllers that you're building internally versus those that you're sourcing from the merchant market?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So our Enterprise SSDs are, as we have said before, designed and manufactured with all controller that are in-house controllers. Our Client SSDs use a mix of internal SanDisk-developed controllers, as well as third-party controller ESS. Even when we have third-party controllers ESS, we do have our own firmware. There's a lot of frequent source of managing the flash memory aspects using a firmware. So SanDisk in Client SSD has a mix of internally developed and third-party purchased controllers. I can't really break down the mix of internal versus external controllers for our Client SSDs, but our strategy is to continue to leverage in the Client SSDs space internal and external controllers because we made those efficient based on best time-to-market opportunities for our products.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Daniel Amir from Lazard Capital.", "Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "So a question here about your competitive position in the SSD market. More on the Enterprise side, given that this is an area that you've been focusing more in the past year. It looks like you're coming out with a PCIe at 19-nanometer. Can you expand a bit more there? And I have one follow-up.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So in the SaaS market, which is what Pliant originally had products in when we acquired them. We have continued to expand the fab customer base for our products, and the revenues today are derived almost all from SaaS-based solutions in enterprise-based. PCIe and Enterprise SATA, these are opportunities for us in the future. Today, our revenue from PCIe is negligibly small, but clearly it's a large market and we are excited about our next-generation products that we will be bringing to market in the second half of this year. And it will give us an opportunity to begin to gain share in this market and grow our revenues. Our focus very much is on leveraging our vertical integration, deep knowledge of flash memory applied to the controllers and systems, and including firmware for our Enterprise SSD products both in fab, PCIe solutions. And looking ahead, we should -- with high-performance solutions and high-capacity solutions, we should be able to -- and high-reliability solutions as well, we should be able to position ourselves well in this market space.", "Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Great. And on the retail side, I mean how much is the strength here in the retail here for Q1 is a Q1 phenomenon, and how much of it is a trend you believe basically will continue throughout the year, and this could be a very strong year in retail overall?", "Judy Bruner", "I would say it's -- I wouldn't characterize it as a Q1 phenomenon. As you know, typically, Q1 has been our weakest quarter in terms of the retail business. And our retail business is down sequentially Q4 to Q1, but the year-over-year strength of 34% growth in our retail business is really just phenomenal. And I would say, we've been gaining share. And as Sanjay commented, we have really increased the mix within the retail business of high-performance products. So we've done very well in terms of segmenting the products that we sell in the retail, and we have increased our share and penetration of emerging market over the last couple of years. So really, I think we've been firing on all cylinders with respect to our retail performance.", "Operator", "Our final question today comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Given the tight supply-and-demand environment, Sanjay, do you see  a situation where your -- some of your customers are willing to sign a longer-term contract and, unlike the past 2 decades, we'll see a different dynamics developing? And I have a follow-up for Judy.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We don't comment on specific customers' contracts or agreements. But what I'll tell you is that, of course, the NAND flash supply is tight, and customers are certainly focusing on making sure that for their going flash requirements, the supply can be sourced. And different customers have different approach in this regard. Certain customers manage it on a month-by-month basis in terms of their purchases, fulfilling their purchase requirements. Some manage on a quarterly basis. And it will not be inconceivable if certain customers do look at even certain longer-term horizon. And we are definitely focused on diversifying our customer base, as well as really deepening our relationships with our customers.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "But could we see an industry trend developing here where the customers are actually -- looking at the difficulties in the shrink and the difficulties -- or the suppliers have consolidated? Why shouldn't they start thinking more than just one month and sign contract for 6 to 9 months?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Well, as I said, different customers have their different approach in this regard, taking into consideration their own business dynamics. So -- I mean, that's all I can really say at this point.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. And then for Judy, even after paying off the convert, you're still going to be left with $20 cash per share. You're incubating smaller SSD-related companies. You have a VC fund. But if this double-digit free cash flow margin were to sustain, how should we think about the strategy here? Should we assume that you're actually looking for acquisitions or you would change your strategy with buyback? Would you become aggressive or would you just focus on saving the cash for a rainy day for acquisition targets? Any color would be great.", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. We do believe that when we transition in the future to 3D technologies, post-planar NAND technologies, that, at some point, we will need to add new capacity for those technologies and that the capital cost of adding that capacity will be high. So we do believe that we will need and utilize some of that cash at some point in time in the future when we are transitioning to 3-dimensional technology. Beyond that, we absolutely want to maintain flexibility for acquisitions. We believe that there could be opportunities out there that could be advantageous to our business and to adding shareholder value, and we want to maintain flexibility to be able to move quickly in those situations. And then on top of that, we are stepping up our share repurchases, as I mentioned. We purchased $90 million in Q1, which compares to $60 million in Q1 a year ago. And that was not enough to offset the employee equity dilution in the first quarter. So we are stepping it up again, and we do expect to spend quite a bit more this year than we did last year on share repurchase. So really, those are 3 areas of usage of the cash.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Mehdi. Thank you, Judy. Thank you, Sanjay. And thank you, everyone, for joining the call. A webcast replay of today's call should be available on our Investor Relations website shortly. Thank you, and see you all on May 8.

I would now like to turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Milligan.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, Wolfgang Nickl will provide additional commentary on our March quarter results and outlook for the June quarter.", "I am pleased with our financial performance in the March quarter. We continue to execute well and capitalize on the ongoing secular growth in digital data. Industry demand was in line with our expectations, and we expect volume in the June quarter to be flat to slightly down with the March quarter. We are cautiously optimistic about the potential for a modest seasonal uptick in demand for the second half of calendar 2013. Our production levels will continue to be adjusted to prevailing demand patterns.", "In the March quarter, both the HGST and WD subsidiaries continued to deliver outstanding financial results, driving gross margin performance well within our model. We continue to effectively manage the diverse elements of our business with a keen focus on operational excellence and value creation for our customers, shareholders and employees. Customers continue to respond favorably to our breadth of product offerings and value-based engagement model. It is important to note that we have established a leadership position in the fastest growing areas of the storage industry.

Western Digital is one of the best positioned technology companies to leverage the ongoing creation, transfer and storage of data, a trend linked directly to consumers' increasingly ubiquitous experience with data in all aspects of their lives. We believe digital data growth will continue unabated for the foreseeable future with total exabyte shift growing from 600 exabytes in 2012 to at least 5,900 exabytes by 2020, representing a 33% compounded annual growth rate.", "Consistent with other recent commentary, we believe exabyte growth is a better and more relevant measure of the growth potential for the industry and our company. Western Digital is a market- and customer-driven company focused on growth and innovation. We develop deep and collaborative relationships with customers, an approach that is being manifested in our role as a trusted advisor and market-maker. We believe this approach will continue to be one of the key factors in helping us to achieve strong business performance.

I am confident that this approach will continue to result in strong and sustainable financial performance, further differentiating Western Digital as one of the world's leading technology companies. I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Thank you, Steve. I will first summarize the total market demand and our consolidated financial performance for the March quarter, and then conclude with a range of our expected financial results for the June quarter. As Steve mentioned, we are very pleased with our March quarter performance as it demonstrates the resilience and strength of our business model. The HDD market shipped approximately 135 million units during the March quarter, flat to the December quarter and in line with our forecasted range in late January. In our business, we saw strength in enterprise, stable quarter-over-quarter performance in client and consumer electronics and anticipated seasonal softness in branded product. Our distribution retail channel inventory continues to be lean, and our analysis suggests that inventory levels at our OEM customers are also in good shape. Our revenue for the quarter was $3.8 billion. We shipped a total of 60.2 million hard drives at an average selling price of $61. We exceeded our revenue guidance due primarily to better-than-expected business and product mix, and lower-than-expected like-for-like price declines.", "The average capacity per drive we shipped in the March quarter was 810 gigabytes, a 35% year-over-year increase. This reflects strengths in our branded and enterprise businesses as well as solid mix-up in our client business to cope with the ever-increasing amount of digital content. Our gross margin for the quarter was 28.2%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 29.2%, excluding $38 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin was approximately 120 basis points better than our guidance as a result of better-than-expected cost improvements and product mix, and lower-than-anticipated price declines. A broad-based participation in the secular growth of digital data is resulting in a more diversified mix of our revenue. Over the last 5 years, the revenue contribution of our non-PC related business has grown from 35% in fiscal year '08 and is projected to account for more than 50% of our revenue in fiscal year '13. As a reminder, our monthly fee-related business is comprised of our branded products, consumer electronics and enterprise business, which includes SSDs.", "R&D and SG&A spending totaled $581 million for the March quarter. SG&A included $22 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST intangible assets and other unrelated charges. We incurred additional charges of $63 million from the March quarter, reflecting continued alignment of our operations with anticipated market demand. As a reminder, we had already incurred total charges of $147 million in the prior 3 quarters, reflecting ongoing infrastructure alignment as well as an evolution of our organization to address growth opportunities.", "Tax expense for the March quarter was $15 million or 4% of pretax income. The rate reflects the retroactive extension of the federal R&D tax credit. Our net income for the March quarter totaled $391 million or $1.60 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $514 million or $2.10 per share.", "Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $727 million in cash from operations during the March quarter, and our free cash flow totaled $539 million. Our CapEx for the March quarter totaled $188 million. For the full fiscal year, we expect to be at the upper end of our CapEx model, including approximately $200 million for expenditures related to the floods in Thailand. Excluding the flood-related spending, we would be close to the bottom end of our model range, reflecting our measured approach to capital spending in today's environment. Out of our capital allocation strategy, we have repurchased 5.2 million shares for $243 million during the March quarter. In addition, we declared a dividend in the amount of $0.25 per share or a total of $60 million, which we paid on April 15 to shareholders of record as of March 29. We exited fiscal Q3 with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 billion, of which $1.5 billion was in the U.S.", "I'll now provide our guidance for the June quarter, which anticipates sustained strong performance within our business model during what is typically the industry's softest quarter. We expect a flat-to-slightly down total available market when compared with the March quarter. Revenue in the range of $3.55 billion to $3.65 billion, reflecting the current demand and pricing environment and the seasonal change in business mix. Gross margin, well within our model at approximately 28.5%, excluding the amortization of HGST intangibles. We expect R&D and SG&A spending to be approximately $550 million, excluding the amortization of HGST intangibles. We expect tax rates within our 7% to 10% model and the share count of approximately 243 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.65 and $1.80 for the June quarter.", "Operator, we're now ready to open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "[indiscernible] and how it impacts your business. I'm sure you've all seen that PC units were down substantially in the March quarter, but if we look at your PC business based on the desktop and the notebook, you were up a little bit. Now I know that those businesses are not exactly correlated, but I think some people are concerned there are some inventory building somewhere in the channel that would describe that difference between what you were seeing and what the PC market is seeing. Can you give us some more detail on why there would be a difference there?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Sure. This is Steve. I mean, one of the things that I think that we have to continue to keep in mind, I mean Wolfgang alluded to it in his prepared remarks, is that we're becoming -- first thing is we're becoming less and less of a PC story and more of an overall digital data growth story. So although we are still impacted by what's happening in the PC market, it's becoming less and less. That being said, yes, the PC market was down. It was only down a bit more than what we actually had forecasted, so our underlying assumptions did not expect there to be particular strength in the PC business. So we were not that surprised on the downside in terms of what happened there, and the fact that our units are up was really more a reflection of our ability to gain a bit of share from an execution standpoint. And then lastly, as Wolfgang indicated, we do not believe at present that there isn't any sort of an inventory issue in terms of the PC market that we're aware of.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then for my follow-up, I just wanted to get a little more detail on the near-line market. How large do you think that market was? What do you think your share was in that market? And what type of growth expectations do you have for that going forward?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, Sherri, that market grew healthy quarter-over-quarter. We believe it was up from 7.5 to like 8.5, 8.4, 8.5, just like a solid increase quarter-over-quarter. Our share there is very solid. Our share is very well distributed across all of our businesses.  Our average share outlook is 44.4, and I'd say our market's up plus minus 2% in that range. And we said before that it's one of the markets that we believe will show solid growth in the future, and we previously said that we expect double-digit growth in those markets. And that's volume and on top of that, significantly more data growth in that market in particular.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "I just wanted to dive a little deeper into one of your comments on the gross margin side. There were some cost savings and, I guess, unanticipated or accelerated cost savings. Was any of that head related or the transition to new aerial density benefiting, or if you can just elaborate a little bit more on those elements?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, Rich, the team's executed very well. We have extremely good linearity, which helped us earn a bit more market share, for the volume was slightly higher than we thought. That helps with the overall absorption. We're not done with the aerial density transition, but we made solid progress. And lastly, I think with our suppliers, and we are now what we would call in a more normal area in terms of internal external sourcing. So all of these things paired with solid execution on -- in both of our subs helped us to -- has better cost than one we thought.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Joseph Quatrochi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "This is Joe Quatrochi for Aaron. I was wondering if you could comment maybe on your days payable kind of increasing because the -- your CCC to increase to 12 days. I was wondering if you could kind of give us an idea of how to model that going forward.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, I mean, our cash conversion cycle target model is 4 to 8 days. We're a tad over that. It's less a function of the days payable. We like that in that range that we displayed. We have made very conscious investments in inventory. As you know, we're restructuring quite a bit in various operations. And when you do that, you want to make sure that you're sufficient, both for materials and plays. We also make sure that we take advantage on where we understand the demand signals very well of ocean shipments; that's quite a cost saving. And then lastly, and particular, our enterprise customers, we want to make sure that we have solid just-in-time warehouse inventory in front of them so that they -- so we don't disrupt their pools as they conduct their business. So midterm opportunity there, I would say more on the inventory turns. But we watch this thing very, very closely. But with the free cash flow of $539 million, we didn't make this one of our top priorities but it's an opportunity going forward.", "Joseph Quatrochi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then for my follow-up, I was wondering if you could comment a little further on OpEx. It looks like it was up sequentially in the quarter, yet headcount was down. I was wondering if -- when we might see an impact from the decrease in headcount going forward.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "First of all, just approaching the 581 to the 540 that we have in our guidance, first of all, the 540 was a non-GAAP measure. So there's about just shy of $20 million on incremental accruals on incentive plans since we overachieved. There is a $10 million or so standard amortization of intangibles that's there every quarter, and then we had a legal settlement there as well. So normalized for incentive payouts, we were pretty much exactly right on with our guidance. In terms of looking forward, we have a reduction of headcount that's mainly in the factories, which you would see the COGS line. But we're also reducing headcount in the OpEx areas but not to bring the overall OpEx down, it's to create room to invest in the growth areas. So we're investing in enterprise, in new platforms and we're investing in SSD and other areas. So the target of the restructuring there is -- let's reduce the number for now from the 550-ish kind of level. It's more to make room for the growth and strategic growth areas.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "I guess this is for either Steve or Wolfgang. Why would gross margins be down in the June quarter off of March if pricing is -- sounds like you're saying pricing is a little better than you expected, and it feels like, just based on the margins you reported this quarter, that the mix is probably leaning at least as good, if not better than you expected. Would just love to get your thoughts on the gross margin dynamics in June.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, I'll give you like the -- some of the drivers. First of all, volume, we said the market is slight to slightly down. So we anticipate that our volume will be down and that doesn't help with cost. But the main driver here is it's seasonally the softest quarter, but it's also seasonally a quarter where we have interesting channel mix dynamic going on. You're shipping more to OEMs, you're shipping less to retail, and in particular, desktop distribution channel is down in this quarter. So it's mainly a function of reduced volumes and business mix. And then we've modeled some price decline for the quarter as well.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Got it. And that's helpful, Wolfgang. Can you -- you guys mentioned -- Steve mentioned in his prepared remarks, I guess, of good adoption of new products. And I know you guys have -- you have the hybrid drives that are out, saw your 5-millimeter announcement, so new enterprise products are coming out and you have the single product drives. Can you give us a sense -- or actually, some drives and some new game stations as we go through the year that I think are actually higher cap. Can you give us some sense of how we should expect the mix to manifest itself on the business as we move through the year? And what -- yes, I know you're not going to be able to give guidance on the gross margin, but it seems like you have really nice mix up. And so any help sort of on how we should think about all those factors manifesting in results would be helpful as we go through the year.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes, so I'll comment on that. We continue to expect our mix to improve. I mean, it's a little bit when I -- I'll talk a little bit about a longer term view. There's always seasonal things that happen quarter-to-quarter, but the mix trends are very favorable from our perspective and it comes back to the fact that digital data growth continues to be very substantial. And people need to store that data somewhere and they need more storage as opposed to less storage. And so we're going to continue to benefit from that. And as we mix up, that is -- that provides better economics for us. And so the longer term, if you want to refer to it as secular trend, is favorable from that perspective.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Scott Craig with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Scott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Two questions. First, Wolfgang, can you take us through the sort of free cash flow usages as you see it for the rest of the year? You talked a bit about CapEx, but maybe where that's going to be spent outside of the $200 million on the Thai-related issues, and then as well as buyback and stuff like that? And then secondly, maybe a question for Steve. Can you discuss the investment in Skyera and just sort of your thought process behind that and maybe why not a PCIe guy? Why on flash? Just sort of kind of take us through your thought process there.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, on the free cash flow, it's really straightforward. I think we had 3 quarters and well above 500. We expect another solid quarter. I think the linearity is going to be okay. We've guided to a CapEx number that would let you conclude that we have somewhat lower than what we spend in Q3 in CapEx. That CapEx now is mainly really focused on technology development, robustness of the supply chain, and then as we mix up in test capacity as well. In terms of what we do after the free cash flow, we stick to the 50% capital allocation strategy to shareholders as a percent of free cash flow. I think we're just a little bit shy of that, and the intention would be to catch up by the end of the fiscal year.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "And in terms of Skyera, just to comment on that, Skyera is a small company based in San Jose that is privately held, focused on SSD array technology. We have been involved with Skyera for a while, both in terms of an initial equity investor as well as we worked with them on a number of different technical areas. And we had the opportunity to participate in their latest equity round, and we're glad to do that. We've got a lot of interesting technology and we're -- not only from an equity perspective, but also just from a technical collaboration perspective. Very pleased to be working with them. In terms of your comment why Skyera versus something else, I don't think that it's an either or. We're very interested in the broader solid state memory area, particularly in the enterprise area, and that includes things that we're doing in terms of our existing enterprise SSD business, also in terms of what companies like Skyera is doing, and also in terms of PCIe. And so this just happens to be one equity investment that we were able to make in the past 90 days.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montr\u00e9al.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I was wondering if you could comment a little bit more about the TAM as you see it this year after -- you specifically identified that the TAM in the June quarter would be flat to down a little bit. Could you talk a little bit about how we should be thinking about sequential growth or second half growth and any more specificity? And more broadly, just want to hear some thoughts on if the PC market -- most consensus, I think, are now down 6%, 7%, 8%, 9% in terms of units. But if the PC market is down 7%, 8% for the next couple of years, what do you think the TAM growth would be for the HDD business against that type of backdrop?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Well, I'll start it off, Keith. So our own assumptions, I think Steve said in his remarks, is a modest seasonal uptick in the second half. And the emphasis on seasonal, I mean, that's purely driven by back-to-school, holidays. And one of the products Steve has talked about, the gaming business that's strong in the second half as well. So you want me to put a number around it, it's somewhere around 140-ish or so. So I think that's a prudent planning assumption. In terms of the PC growth...", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Sorry, 140 for the kind of the September quarter, I assume you mean?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, September and December. And then I think Steve said it that, yes, I see and Gartner has posted, I believe, 11% and 13% decline in the first quarter for the PC market. That was not too far off what we had modeled in our assumptions. I think we wouldn't disagree with like an assumption of like 5% or so year-over-year decline of that market. IDC and Gartner forecast the market then to resume, like, modest growth. I think we would agree with that. And we continue to believe that our market, from a volume perspective, is increasing from this year on by like 3%. And that's really driven by capacity, enterprise and branded. And we quoted the numbers on our PC and our non-PC related business, and we continue to see that trend to go to non-PC related businesses.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Right. So philosophically, if the market's down 5% to 7% on a sustained basis, you think you can have positive unit growth even against that PC backdrop?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "If we go back, Keith, I mean I think that there's a couple key points to emphasize. I mean, one, we are not anticipating a meaningful change in terms of what's happening in the PC market. We're not counting on that. We're being very cautious with regards to our production plans in that regard. The other thing is that we talked about, at our Investor Day, was a longer-term unit growth rate in terms of HDDs of 3%. That continues to be our current assumption, but that growth is not coming from PCs. It's coming from other areas.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Two questions. I mean, one, you guys are guiding for a flattish TAM in the June quarter, flat down. But I think your sales sort of implies sales will be down somewhere in the 4.5% range. Can you talk about how much of that is pricing-driven versus potentially, you give up some of the share gains you had in the March quarter as you go through June?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Amit, the first impact is really from a segment mix, like, for instance, the pricing in our branded products is significantly higher than if we ship into a gaming solution, for instance. And so that's a big driver. If you look for like-for-like pricing, I mean, we have modeled modest declines there. And share is not really something that we plan for, that's more like an outcome. We plan to have really good product and deliver it in a very linear fashion to the market, and the share is what the share is.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Fair enough. And then if I look at just the enterprise side, it actually looks like you guys picked up a decent amount of share in the March quarter. When you think about it, I mean, do you think that was more a reflection of just the right customers you're partnered with or some of the newer technologies that you're talking of that has started to take more adoption, and that potentially could accelerate, I would imagine, as you get through the year?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "I don't know if I would draw any significant conclusions one way or the other in terms of the share. We did pick up a little bit of share in enterprise. Now if you go back, we had lost a little bit of share. So there are share gains and losses that occurred quarter-to-quarter occasionally within rough moderate ranges. And so I don't think that I would point to anything significantly per se other than the fact that, a longer-term thing, we continue to provide compelling products to our customers and we engage with them in a way that they want to buy more of our product.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Cindy Shaw with DISCERN.", "Cindy Shaw - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc", "A couple of questions for you. One, there's been a lot of hopes within some in the industry about a pickup in the second half due to things like the Windows XP end-of-life April next year, Ultrabooks for some folks, and some saying a better supply of touchscreen panels for Windows 8 notebooks would pick that up as we head into late next -- late this calendar year. And I'm wondering, is that in your guidance or would that be providing upside?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Right now, we, as well as many of our customers in the PC space, are being very cautious with regards to the demand expectations. We'd certainly like to see and hope to see some of the dynamics that you're talking about to increase demand in the back half of the year. Right now, we are being pretty cautious in terms of our outlook from our standpoint as we talked about earlier.", "Cindy Shaw - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc", "So it sounds like if that really transpires, that would be an opportunity for upside for you, is that right?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "That's possible, that's possible.", "Cindy Shaw - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc", "Okay. And then my follow-up question, with your 5-millimeter drives, it seems like you're getting a bit of a head start on the competition, and I'm wondering if that's really the case. And also, I'm hearing that the connector for your drive is different than the industry standard and would not be a drop-in replacement for other 5-millimeter drives. And I'm wondering if that's true, and if so, what the philosophy behind that is.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Well, we're working very closely with a number of different customers to look for them to adopt to our 5-millimeter drive. And we've been pretty pleased, both in terms of the standard rotating magnetic drive as well as the hybrid drive, to get some adoption of that product as we move through the back half of the year. And so we're very encouraged with where we're at. In terms of the adapter, you're right, it is not a traditional industry standard adapter. We did that to provide for enhanced shock characteristics in terms of the mobility for that drive, and we're getting positive response from our customers so far.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Scott Schmitz with Morgan Stanley.", "Scott Schmitz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I'm just wondering if we can go back and if you can update us on your cost structure a little bit more. And more specifically, what percentage is a variable cost? And then as it relates to that, if we look at utilization, I know it's difficult to kind of paint with a broad brush, but what components have the lowest utilization and conversely, what ones are the highest?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, I mean, we haven't really given out the exact split between fixed and variable cost. I mean, you can look at our -- if you check our non-GAAP depreciation, amortization's like $260 million a quarter. So you can assume that that's just probably around half of our fixed cost. I mean, the rest is factory engineering and utilities and maintenance and stuff like that. So I think we have an industry-leading cost structure in terms of what part is variable. And then in terms of capacity utilization, that remains an opportunity in certain parts of our business, I think you have characterized it well. You can't speak about capacity utilization in general, though. There are certain aspects of our infrastructure that are very tight, like I mentioned, that we're investing in test capacity. And there are certain aspects that were not hit by the floods and they are a little bit long right now. I wouldn't want to go into exact detail where that is, but we're balancing that every quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Maynard Um with Wells Fargo.", "Maynard Joseph Um - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Can you just help us think about the PC mix and ASP you're embedding going forward? And I'm curious because on the one hand, you have the PC OEMs that are under a greater margin pressure and pressure to reduce pricing to drive some unit volume. So do you think that drives lower capacity drives into the market? And doesn't look like that's a trend you're seeing, but do you think there's an offset here from higher hybrid drive shipments? Can you just talk about the industry dynamics and how to think about that impact to you?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes. So OEM customers are our PC customers. I mean, the primary issue that exists is that they've got to get compelling products out there at a cost point that compels consumers to purchase them. And sure, of course they're cost-sensitive. But I think the bigger issue is the product's got to be right. And so if you look at what we're doing in terms of the 5-millimeter product, what we're trying to do is provide a thin and light storage device that our customers can design around that provides a more compelling product for them. It's not going to make a big difference to them if they save $1 or $2 on how much they pay for them.", "Maynard Joseph Um - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Got it. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, with the PC market pretty much kind of where you expected it, can you just talk about where -- how far along you are and reactions to reset capacity, where you're comfortable and maybe just give us some other quantitative or qualitative idea of where you are?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, I mean, you've seen us with a couple of quarters of restructuring activity and you see our gross margin well within our model, so we have been very, very active. And that little bit of something that we have to wait and see. I mean, we said that we expect a bit of an uptick in the second half of the year. So we'll just watch that very, very carefully and we've proven historically that we can react in the unit direction in terms of capital deployment.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "I think Steve talked about kind of impact of PCs on your TAM. I want to touch base on the impact from pure declined SSDs on the TAM, too. So if you look at third party data or what OEMs are saying, they think 2013, we can see at least 20 million pure declined SSDs? So could you maybe talk about, first of all, do you think it's possible, something like that kind of a volume? And secondly, how that could impact the business?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "So what's interesting in terms of what we've seen is that the issue in terms of hard drive TAM, right, because it's obviously down, it's down from 170 million pre-flood to 135 million this past quarter.  Clearly, we've been impacted in that regard by lower PC sales. But it's not because of SSD replacements within PCs. In fact, we've actually seen that pure SSD as an alternative for hard drives has not changed significantly from what we expected or from what we've seen historically. Now you are seeing dual-drive configurations where you've got SSD in a hard drive. And so that -- but we're agnostic to that. That's okay from our perspective. The issue is that there are competing devices, for example, tablets, that are more compelling to customers that they're buying instead of PCs. And so if you go back to the 5-millimeter story or the hybrid story, what we're trying to do as a company is provide a more compelling storage alternative in a thin and light package that our customers can work around, design more compelling products to have them buy a PC or a PC-like ultraportable device and versus a tablet.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "And then just one last one here regarding Skyera. Skyera makes its own SSDs, so is it possible you might look at kind of selling the SSDs, not just the systems made by Skyera?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Well, they're an SSD array company, primarily.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Miller with Noble Financial Capital Market.", "Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "I'm just wondering if you could estimate right now the percent of data being stored on the cloud that's gone on hard drives, and where you think that might be in 3 years?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Mark, when we look at it in terms of data storage, we believe that -- I can't remember off the top of my head, frankly, what the timeframe was, but that moving into the future, I think it was either 2017 or 2020 that 85% of data will continue to be stored on rotating magnetic storage.", "Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "And then also comment on the margin differential between the drives used in cloud storage and a typical lap drive in a PC.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, I mean, the -- the drive that's going to the cloud, of highest quality, highest engineered products and they command the margin premium, so they're significantly higher than the margins in the PC space.", "Mark S. Miller - Noble Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "Would I be wrong to ballpark that between 75% and 100% higher on average?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "You're not going to quit on your question, are you? You're not going to back off? And Wolfgang's not going to answer either.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rob Cihra with Evercore Partners.", "Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Two questions, if I could. One, just wondering where you are in progress on a 500-gig per platter notebook and 1 terabyte on desktop. You seem -- I'm assuming you won't say anything in terms of percentage of your mix or anything, but maybe just relative to your roadmap in terms of rolling out those capacity points this year. And then my second question, just going back to enterprise, you had mentioned there's good organic growth in near-line demand or capacity optimized. Just wondering if whether in the near-line or the mission critical these days, you think there's any lingering recovery still from the September quarter inventory correction, if that's helping at all or if that's kind of long done, and what we're seeing now is true demand?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "From the aerial density, we're less than 50% on the latest and greatest. So that represents an opportunity of quarters for us. And then what was your question, near-line was...", "Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Just how much of -- whether near-line are also on that sort of a traditional enterprise, if any of the sort of sequential growth you saw on the quarter that you're seeing now still has anything to do with you're still recovering from September quarter, last year's inventory correction, or if you think that's long past and what you're seeing now is true end demand.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "We don't believe there's any inventory issue in that area of the market, and that our -- it represents true unit demand.", "All right. I want to thank you, again, for joining us. In closing, I also want to thank all Western Digital employees for their dedication and outstanding performance, and our customers and their suppliers for their support.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn things over to Mr. Brendan Lahiff with Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Brendan Lahiff", "Thank you, and good afternoon. With me on the call today are Sanjay Mehrotra, President and CEO of SanDisk; Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President of Administration and CFO.", "Before we begin, please note that any non-GAAP financial matters discussed during this call as defined by the SEC in Regulation G will be reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. That reconciliation is now available, along with supplemental schedules on our website at sandisk.com/ir.", "Please note that non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation tables for all applicable guidance will be posted on our website.

SanDisk assumes no right -- no obligation to update these forward-looking statements which speak as of today. With that, I will turn the call over to Sanjay.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Thank you, Brendan, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report record second quarter revenue and strong margin. We made excellent focus with our embedded mobile product portfolio with new design wins, and our SSD business gained further momentum. We remained focused on strengthening our product portfolio, and our execution in technology transitions remained outstanding. Our second quarter achievements have put the company on a path to deliver the record 2013.", "Our second quarter performance was driven by strong growth in our mobile embedded products with iNAND and iNAND MCP, causing the largest revenue gains during the quarter. Our embedded solutions team has made significant progress over the past year, and their efforts to diversify our customer base with an expanded array of compelling solutions is bearing fruit.", "Both smartphone and tablet adoption rates continue to be strong in the industry with industry analysts forecasting more than 900 million smartphones to ship in 2013, with tablet volumes expected to approach 200 million. Further, China smartphone OEMs are becoming increasingly important in the global smartphone market, with analysts estimating the top China brands to ship more than 10% of smartphone volume this year.", "SanDisk has made significant inroads into this growing market with our iNAND and iNAND MCP offerings, building further upon our strong presence with global smartphone OEMs. New smartphone launches, including numerous premium brands, continue to feature card slots to expand device storage beyond the embedded capacity.", "In particular, the attach rates of slots to non-iOS phones remains greater than 90%, indicating strong OEM interest in providing storage expansion options to the end customer. This trend continues to play in our favor as reflected by another strong quarter for our retail business, which was in part driven by year-over-year and sequential revenue growth from retail sales of our branded microSD cards.", "Recently, we introduced the world's fastest 64-gigabyte SanDisk Extreme microSD card. With read and write speeds of 80 and 50 megabytes per second, respectively, the SanDisk Extreme microSD card further extends our high-performance mobile product offering to address increasingly features such as camera and video applications in not only smartphones and tablets but in other device categories, such as sports cameras. For the retail market, we also introduced new consumer SSDs, such as the SanDisk Extreme II SSD, and initial reviews have been very positive.", "Turning to SSDs. For the client market, we have completed several customer qualifications of our SSDs made with our 19-nanometer technology and we began revenue shipments of these products during the quarter. We also began shipments of high-performance 19-nanometer Client SSDs in small form factors using the PCIe interface.", "The Client SSD market continues to grow, driven by increasing customer preference for high-performance, instant on capabilities, antenna and sleek form factors. SanDisk is particularly well positioned to benefit from this trend as we are providing our broad array of SanDisk alone -- standalone and caching solution to the vast majority of leading PC OEMs already.", "In Enterprise SSDs, we are pleased to report another quarter of solid double-digit sequential growth, representing our third consecutive quarter of record revenue. Further building on this momentum, we are excited with our recently announced agreement to acquire SMART Storage Systems, an innovative supplier of SATA and SAS SSDs for the enterprise space. This acquisition will help us further deepen our enterprise product offerings by building upon our successful line of at SAS SSDs.", "Upon the close of the acquisition, which is expected in the third quarter, SMART Storage portfolio of SATA products will immediately expand our competitive capabilities and open up a $1.6 billion incremental opportunity for SanDisk in enterprise SATA. Additionally, the acquisition will also add 2 new Tier 1 storage OEMs to our customer roster and we will be qualified with our Enterprise SSDs as 6 of the top 7 storage OEMs upon close of the acquisition. Further, this acquisition will enable us to augment our engineering team with talented engineers from SMART Storage Systems.", "SMART Guardian Technology, which is a suite of key firmware and hardware design technologies that together enhance the endurance and reliability of the Enterprise SSDs, has already won strong customer endorsements, and we expect to broaden its benefits by implementing it in our other future product offering. As industry demand for Enterprise SSDs continues to grow, we believe that vertically integrated manufacturers, with captive non-flash supply, have a distinct long-term advantage in terms of both the development capability and supply continuity over others that must procure NAND.", "From a manufacturing standpoint, in the second quarter, our 19-nanometer technology represented approximately 85% of fab output. We expect to begin initial production of 1Y technology late in the third quarter of 2013 with meaningful output commencing in the fourth quarter.", "Switching to supply topics, our forecast for SanDisk captive bit supply growth remains unchanged in the 20% range for 2013 and between 25% and 35% for 2014.", "For the industry, our expectation for healthy supply and demand balance in 2013 and 2014 remains unchanged. Our bit growth estimates for the industry have consistently included the assumption of new wafer capacity additions, as well as conversions of some DRAM capacity to NAND and early generation of 3D NAND, and we have not heard anything new that would change our estimate.", "As we mentioned at our Investor Day, we do not expect the early generations of 3D NAND to be cost-effective versus 2D planar NAND nor to have any meaningful contribution to the industry bit supply until the 2015, 2016 time frame.", "In late June, we announced our decision to commence construction of Phase 2 of Fab 5 with expected completion of the building shell in mid-2014. I will remind you that the primary use of the new clean room space will be to enable the 1Y and 1Z technology transition in Fab 3, 4 and Phase 1 of Fab 5, and for a pilot line for BiCS NAND. We do not expect Phase 2 of Fab 5 to contribute to any meaningful increment to our total wafer output in 2014.", "In closing, we are very pleased to have reported record second quarter revenues and strong margin, setting the stage for a stronger second half of 2013. With robust long-term demand drivers, coupled with our broadening portfolio of solutions and growing traction with our diverse customer base, we are excited about our future prospects. We remain focused on executing to our technology strategy, prudently managing our capacity, driving profitable growth and creating shareholder value.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Judy for her financial review and outlook.", "Judy Bruner", "Thank you, Sanjay. We delivered robust second quarter results, reflecting the benefit of our diversified product portfolio and customer base, our low-cost leading edge memory supply and our disciplined capacity management. And we are pleased to have accelerated returns to our stockholders with $280 million spent on share repurchase during the second quarter and $370 million year-to-date. Our record second quarter revenue grew 10% sequentially and 43% year-over-year.", "Our ASP per gigabyte was up 5% from Q1, increasing sequentially for the third consecutive quarter, driven by a higher revenue mix of embedded products, coupled with a stable supply-demand environment. And this is the first time in our history that our ASP per gigabyte increased on a year-over-year basis, rising 6% from Q2 of last year, reflecting an increased mixed of SSDs and embedded products, along with a strong pricing environment. The year-over-year shift in our product mix toward SSDs and embedded products is also manifesting itself in an increased average capacity of per unit sales. Average capacity per unit increased a strong 92% year-over-year. Our bit sold increased 4% sequentially and 35% year-over-year, with the growth in our bit supply coming primarily from continued transition to 19-nanometer memory.", "Our second quarter revenue came 65% from our commercial customers and 35% from retail with strong year-over-year growth in both channels. Our retail sales grew 22% year-over-year with continued improving mix of high-performance products and particularly strong growth in the average capacity of our retail mobile cards. Geographically, we achieved strong year-over-year retail growth in all major regions. Our commercial revenue grew 57% year-over-year with embedded products and SSDs being the biggest contributors.", "Looking at the mix of our total revenue by form factor, the combination of embedded and SSD products achieved the highest ever proportion of our revenue at 46% with embedded revenue at 30% and SSDs at 16%. Our removable product revenue was flat year-over-year with retail card and USB revenue growing enough to offset the decline from OEM bundled card sales and our de-prioritization of non-branded card sales.", "Our non-GAAP gross margin increased over 600 basis points sequentially to 46.7% in Q2, exceeding our previous forecast primarily because of better-than-expected pricing and product mix. Our cost-per-gigabyte declined 5% sequentially and 21% year-over-year with the primary drivers being increased 19-nanometer mix and a weaker yen, partially offset by the impact of increased revenue mix from products containing a higher proportion of non-flash memory cost.", "The sequential improvement in our 19-nanometer memory mix was the result of beginning-to-sell Client SSDs using 19-nanometer technology. The cost improvement due to the yen reflected a Q2 yen rate in cost of sales of 85 compared to 81 in Q1 and 79 in the year-ago quarter.", "Our Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses were $260 million, equal to our previous forecast. Our Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was a robust 29% and our non-GAAP tax rate was 31.5%, slightly below the rate we had forecasted. Our diluted share count increased slightly sequentially as our accelerated share repurchases were only partially counted in weighted shares for Q2. And this decrease was offset by the impact of our 2017 convertible debt, which added 1.6 million shares to diluted share count.", "For Q2 reporting, the 2017 convertible was in the money with a conversion price of $52.37 compared to the Q2 average stock price of $57.05. Accounting rules do not allow us to count the offsetting shares expected from our call option, which will act to increase the effective conversion price of the convertible to $73.33. We have posted a schedule on our website, which outlines the share dilution expected from the convertible at various stock prices and also shows the expected offset from the call option at maturity of the convertible.", "Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we generated our highest ever Q2 cash flow from operations at $391 million. We spent $928 million to pay off the remainder of our 2013 convertible debt and we spent $280 million on share repurchases to retire 5.07 million shares at an average price of $55.27.", "Other key cash flow items included $71 million of expenditures for non-fab CapEx and a receipt of $20 million from the fab joint ventures. Our total gross cash and investments ended the quarter at $5.35 billion. Our accounts receivable increased sequentially due to higher sales and due to the timing of both our retail and commercial sales being more weighted toward the second half of the quarter due to retail seasonality and OEM customer needs.", "The fab joint ventures invested in approximately $130 million of fab equipment for SanDisk technology transitions in the second quarter, bringing year-to-date fab investments to approximately $180 million. Our off-balance sheet fab equipment lease guarantees stood at $612 million at the end of the quarter.", "I'll now turn to forward-looking commentary. The forecast I will provide include the estimated non-GAAP impact of the SMART Storage Systems acquisition, which we expect will close before the end of our third quarter.", "We are seeing strong demand for all key product lines, and we expect supply-demand balance to remain healthy. Our bit supply growth will be limited and will come primarily from continued transition to 19-nanometer memory, which is now being used broadly across our Client SSD products.", "Our third quarter revenue forecast is $1,525,000,000 to $1,575,000,000. And we now expect our full year revenue to be between $5.95 billion and $6.05 billion, a substantial increase from our previous estimate. We forecast our third quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 47% to 48%, reflecting a positive impact from a weaker yen exchange rate and a higher 19-nanometer mix, partially offset by some downward movement in our blended pricing, primarily due to product mix, including a seasonal increase in USB sales for back-to-school shopping and the mix of custom embedded products.", "We now expect our full year gross margin to be north of 45%, higher than our previous forecast of 42% to 44%. We expect our expenses to increase in the second half of 2013 due to the SMART Storage Systems acquisition, the timing of certain R&D project expenses and increased headcount for development of our expanded product roadmap and to support our growing commercial customer base.", "We forecast Q3 non-GAAP expenses to be between $285 million and $290 million and we now expect the full year non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.1 billion. We expect our tax rate to remain about the same, and we expect our diluted share count to be approximately constant with a continued strong rate of share repurchase, offset by increased accounting dilution from our convertible debt. We expect 2013 total capital investments, which include investments from our flash ventures to be near the lower end of the range previously provided or approximately $1.1 billion with the total net cash outlay of approximately $350 million.", "In summary, we are pleased to raise our 2013 forecast for revenue and gross margins. And we now expect to deliver a record year in top and bottom line results.", "We will now open the call for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll hear first from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.", "Michael Chen", "This is Michael Chen speaking in for John Pitzer. I just have a question on -- some of your competitors have stated that samples of 3D NAND could come out as early as end of the year. Your expectations and time line for the production of 3D NAND is quite a bit later. So I was just wondering, I guess, can you please explain the difference or the discrepancy?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "As we have described at our Investor Day, we are very much focused on continuing to scale NAND from 1Y, which we will begin to ramp up in production late this quarter to 1Z technology node, which we will begin to ramp up into production late next year, early 2015 time frame. And these are technologies that will be, we believe, will be the lowest cost technologies in 2014 and 2015 time frame. Our 3D NAND technology that we plan to bring to production, the bit NAND technology is a highly scalable and very efficient technology, we will bring it to production in the marketplace, we believe, in second half of 2015, 2016 time frame because that's when this technology will give us lower cost than 1Z technology. So our 2D NAND and 3D BiCS technology continues to position us well for cost leadership through 2D NAND through 2015 time frame. And then with 3D NAND, beginning in 2016 time frame. And also I want to point out that the 3D NAND technology that is being discussed by NAND industry supplier, is a technology that is not as scalable, not as efficient as our BiCS 3D NAND technology. So from what has been published in the literature, we have studied that technology and we have concluded that it will take 2 or 3 generations of that technology before it becomes really competitive with 2D NAND technologies that will be in the marketplace. So our strategy is very much focused on maximizing the ROI of the technologies and that's why the longer you can go with 2D NAND, the better ROI you have. And then once 2D NAND cannot be scaled any further, that's when it is the best to bring 3D NAND technologies. I feel very comfortable with our technology strategy for the years ahead in terms of cost leadership and continuing to drive our objective of profitable growth.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Sanjay, as you scale the SSD strategy on the enterprise side with all the investments, how should we think about the software piece of the revenue? And would you be able, at some point, to actually break out the software from the rest of the revenue mix?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "The software revenue in the foreseeable future will continue to be small. And we do not plan to break it out. Software really is giving us tremendous opportunity to engage in meaningful dialogue with enterprise customers for their future roadmap. And software, of course, is giving us opportunities to bring value, greater value, to our customers with innovative, differentiated solutions. And our software is something that not only works with our hardware, our enterprise-grade hardware drive, but it is also a software strategy that will actually work with other competitors' hard drive as well, and that really, truly, brings strong value proposition to our enterprise customers.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "So how can we evaluate or quantify this value creation that the software piece brings?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Well, the software piece will give us value creation in our hardware solution sales that we make to the customer. In terms of expanding our opportunity and differentiating our value offering, as well as through software, we are able to expand the market opportunity for enterprise-grade SSDs as well. Because the combination of hardware and software really provides even greater value and accelerate the penetration of SSDs in the enterprise segment.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Sure, I understand. The problem that we're facing is the bits times ASP is no longer going to work for SanDisk, given the value creation that you just mentioned. And I'm just trying to figure out if there is a better way of capturing and quantifying this value creation.", "Judy Bruner", "I think you'll see the value creation in our revenue growth and our margins over time.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.", "Brian C. Peterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "This is Brian Peterson in for Hans. Could you guys talk about what hedging assumptions you're using for the yen in the third quarter and then maybe in the fourth quarter?", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. Relative to the third quarter, we expect that the rate will be approximately 94. And that is largely -- that is basically locked in, in terms of our purchases at this point. However, the exact rate will depend on which inventory flows through during the quarter. And relative to the fourth quarter, our purchases that will impact the fourth quarter are largely locked in, although not totally locked in, and that rate at present, we expect will be about 97.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets.", "Earl Hege - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "This is Earl Hege calling in for Doug Freedman. How should we think about cost declines moving through the year? Just some of the puts and takes on that would be helpful.", "Judy Bruner", "Well, remember that our -- at our Investor Day, we indicated that we expect the cost decline for this year to be between 15% and 25%. And in fact, in the quarter just reported, the year-over-year cost decline was 21%. And so we still expect to be in that range. I would expect that the yen will have a somewhat bigger impact on the third quarter than it did on the second quarter. On the other hand, the increasing mix of 19-nanometer had a bigger cost improvement impact on the second quarter than we expect it will have on the third quarter. So those are some of the puts and takes.", "Earl Hege - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Great. And one more, if I can. How do you see the linearity of the 1Y ramp? In other words, when you -- when would you expect crossover? And should we continue to expect an extended tail on the life cycle of that?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So 1Y, in terms of crossover in production output versus 19-nanometer, you would expect it sometime next year, sometime around mid-next year. 1Y will start production late this year, it will continue to ramp for several quarters. I will expect it to ramp into 2015 perhaps as well. Remember, 19-nanometer started production late fourth quarter of 2011. And has ramped through 2013 time frame. We just reported that in Q2, at least 85% of the total output. I would expect a similar ramp in 1Y, perhaps, could be a bit longer because the mix of our embedded and enterprise business and OEM business now is larger compared to what it was during the 19-nanometer NAND.", "Operator", "And that comes from Mark Newman with Sanford Bernstein.", "Mark C. Newman - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "My first question -- I have a question on your mix. I wanted to see, how much of this ASP increase is from the product mix versus increase in like-for-like, if there is any way you could break that out? And then secondly, I have a question, to get a better idea of shortages in the industry or supply tightness, could you give us some kind of idea? Do you have customers that are actually on allocation? Are you turning down business, which is helping you to improve your mix, because I -- we can see that your mix is improving quite substantially. Your mix in the removable has gone down substantially below 50% now. And I'm wondering, is this being helped by shortages in the industry? And if you could give us some kind of idea in how severe the shortages are, to just get an idea what the situation is out there in the industry.", "Judy Bruner", "Okay, Mark, let me take that. So in terms of our price, our increase in price, absolutely it's been impacted by both real price increases that we have made in like-for-like products but it is also being influenced year-over-year and sequentially by product mix. As our mix increases in embedded product, for example, which was very strong in the second quarter and year-over-year, very much -- there's a big increase in mix of SSDs. So both of those factors are increasing and increasing the average selling price.", "Mark C. Newman - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Is there any way to break out what the like-for-like increase would be Q-on-Q?", "Judy Bruner", "Quarter-on-quarter basis, it is more a like-for-like price increase than it is a mix effect on the average selling price. And then in terms on shortages and tightness in the market, we do absolutely have some pockets of supply constraint in our inventory. And we are prioritizing carefully how we utilize our supply. And we are prioritizing supply for our value-added products. We have reduced the mix in our business private-label cards, as well as wafers and components. And so that mix is also impacting our average selling price statistics.", "Operator", "And we'll move next to James Schneider of Goldman Sachs.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Starting out, the industry commentary on bit growth. As I think you mentioned many of your -- the equipment suppliers, Semicon West last week talked about expectations of around 100,000 worth of new wafer starts equipment orders being done by the end of this year. I was wondering, you certainly talked about the fact that you don't expect your bit growth estimates for the industry to fall outside the ranges, you outlined at the Analyst Day, 30% to 40%. But can you give us any sense about whether that wafer level do you believe is accurate and whether you think that might be towards the higher or lower end of that range for '14?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Yes, so for 2014, our estimates are that the total industry wafer production output will increase by about 10%. In 2013, that increases about 6% to 7%. So if you look at 2013, we estimate that the total wafer production output in the industry would be around 14.5 million wafers. And in 2014 time frame, I would expect that to be somewhere under 16 million wafers, so amounting to about a 10% increase. With that, I would just like to point out that, these are the lowest percentage increases in the industry in the last several years. I mean, the increases that we have had in 2012, toward 2013 and '14. So this ultimately translates our estimations of bit growth in 2014 to about 30% to 40%. It is too soon to say whether it will be toward the upper half of that range or around the lower half but it will be somewhere in that range, we believe. And with that 30% to 40% bit output growth in 2014, when you compare that to the demand increase that is expected, the underlying demand trend in the industry, I believe, it continues to bode well for a strong industry environment in 2014 as well. And these kinds of the bit growth rates, as we had highlighted at the Investor Day, 30% to 40% kind in 2013, as well as in 2014, these are the lowest ever bit growth rate in our industry. And again, pointing to a healthy environment. So the supply trends, I believe, are best ever. The demand trends are best ever in the industry. And overall, demand supply environment is healthy as ever.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then just a quick housekeeping one for me. Specifically, as we get to the Q4 of this year, what do you expect that 1Y node to constitute in terms of your total output or production, however you want to put it?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "It will be -- in terms bit production, over 10%.", "Operator", "We'll hear next from Vijay Rakesh of Sterne Agee.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "I just wanted to ask on the 1Y, 1Z transition, if you could lay out how do you think the mix would be as you ramp 1Y by the end of the year? Or how do you see 1Y next year?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "1Y will continue to ramp during the course of next year, as I mentioned earlier. It will start in the third quarter, it will continue to ramp for several quarters, similar ramp, perhaps a little bit longer than the 19-nanometer ramp in terms of number of quarters. But it will be ramping throughout the course of 2014.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And on the SSD side, obviously, you bought SMART Storage, any update on do you think your SSD mix will be much higher as you get through 2014 with the new acquisitions? And do you see any, I mean, I know you have good visibility into the channel, but any of this can -- double ordering or any of that?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We are very excited about the pending SMART acquisition and this will definitely enable us to offer to our customers a broader array of offerings in SAS products, as well as really opening up this $1.6 billion enterprise SATA SSD market for us. And as I mentioned, I mean, a great team of engineers that gets added to the SanDisk already great team of engineers as well. So this is really very exciting, and we are looking forward to bringing strong value proposition to our customers with the full benefits of vertical integration. And we remain on track for 25% of our revenue coming from SSDs in 2014 time frame. And 2013, I would expect our revenue from SSD to be more than 15%.", "Operator", "And we'll hear next from Daniel Amir of Lazard.", "Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Given that you had an Analyst Day in the middle of the quarter, what was kind of the big difference here in the past, in the last 6 weeks of the quarter, that made the quarter much better than you expected? I mean, we are was really the upside, was it pricing, was it more of the product mix? Was it the costs that were maybe slightly better? Because given that you clearly outperformed here on a big side on the margin front especially, and on the guidance here for the year, raising the revenue -- the annual revenue guidance.", "Judy Bruner", "Sure, Daniel. The biggest impact that enabled us to achieve higher revenue and higher margin than we had forecasted for the second quarter was the pricing that we experienced. So it was really the very strong supply-demand environment and our ability to capture higher prices for the sales that we generated, that was the biggest factor. I would tell you that the costs were about as we had expected and it really was higher pricing. Strong demand, of course, but higher pricing. And then a secondary factor was that even within certain product lines, we had favorable mix within those product lines. So as an example, within our Enterprise SSDs, we had a favorable mix of products that impacted gross margins favorably.", "Daniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then the follow-up question is, Sanjay, you gave some commentary about smartphones and card slots and the fact that microSD is doing well. A few quarters ago, the industry was talking about a slowdown of cards and attach rates with cards and phones. Has anything changed in terms of that trend, given that more and more are moving towards more embedded? Or was that more of a few quarter issue and you still believe that there is a market -- a large market here for the removable card side as well?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So what we had talked about last year was about bundling of cards with the mobile OEMs. And that trend has continued showing a decline in bundling rates. In fact, bundling of cards with headset shipments is quite low and contributes a very small portion of our revenue at this point. So really no change in terms of the bundling of cards with the mobile handsets by the OEMs. In terms of the opportunity -- some of that opportunity clearly with less bundling has shifted to the retail market and SanDisk, with its strong global share in retail, #1 brand, has really done well to capture that. And particularly that trend happens to be one of higher capacity cards as well, the smartphones, increasing appeal of those smartphones, increasing multimedia functionality with card slots. When consumers buy the cards, they tend to buy highest capacity cards than what would've been in the past bundled with the phone. So it really is playing to our strength of a very strong global retail presence, as well the highest capacity of the retail card and certainly, high-performance as well because these smartphones are requiring more and more high-performance experience through the cards and our Ultra and Extreme cards, microSD cards, are doing well in the marketplace and we command a premium as well.", "Operator", "And moving on, we'll hear from Michael Bressler of Kensico.", "Michael Bressler", "I have 2 specific questions. My first question is on the NAND market. The NAND market consists of both low-grade and high-grade products and the demand for high-grade product is increasing just as it is becoming more difficult to produce. How should I think about the price premium for NAND that is high-grade and can qualify for an enterprise drive? And what percentage of your NAND that could qualify for an enterprise drive or this high-end application? And then how do you compare that with the overall market? And I have one more question.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So with respect to the flash that is used in enterprise-grade products, certainly, that is high-quality flash, and SanDisk produces high-quality flash and with the benefits that we have with vertical integration and we have always said that in the enterprise space, it's very important to have the full benefits of vertical integration to really ultimately win in that marketplace. As part of the benefit of vertical integration, when the system engineers, the controller engineers are really able to work with the device technologies that are developing the flash, the interaction really develops in helping us produce at the wafer level, high-grade, high-quality flash, which we believe, is better than other suppliers in the industry. And I'll just point to you that the flash memory that is used in our enterprise-grade product is the X -- 2-bit per cell, the X2 memory, not the X3 memory. So one aspect is leveraging vertical integration to really produce high quality flash memory wafers in production that ultimately can meet the requirements of enterprise grade products. The second aspect, of course, is having controllers and the system expertise and the firmware to really work with the flash, to manage the flash, to really give the reliability and the performance that the enterprise-grade applications expect. And it's not only that controllers, system expertise and high-grade flash memory wafer production, but it is also the testing of flash memory at the back-end. We really apply sophisticated testing techniques to really ensure that this flash memory is the highest grade flash to be used in enterprise-grade applications. So all of this really points to the benefits of vertical integration in leveraging high-grade, high-quality flash that is needed for leadership in enterprise grade. Regarding the price premium in enterprise, of course, we have mentioned before that we have higher-than-corporate averages, the highest margins in enterprise-grade products. But we're really not prepared to disclose the price premium of enterprise-grade products versus other products.", "Michael Bressler", "Got it, okay. And my second question is on 3D NAND. When I was at Semicon West, I met with a leading inspection company and they told me that the problem with 3D NAND is that you don't inspect the product until it is finished. So if the defect is discovered in the middle of the stack, there is no way to correct for it. In the absence of great controller technology, how can this product ever be cost-competitive against leading-edge planar X3?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So there are 2 things here that I think you are referring to, Michael. One is, with the 3D NAND technology, in terms of the device structure itself, which you can look at it as multistory, multilayers of NAND flash stacked higher, certainly, in terms of in-line inspection or failure analysis, the challenge is much more daunting compared to the 2D NAND because, again, if there is a fault occurring at any level in a multi-level structure, it becomes -- it takes longer to figure that out as well as the failure analysis becomes more complex and you may have processed those wafers in the fab through all the steps until the end before you figure out that something has gone wrong at certain levels embedded deep in that multilayer structure. So this points to the challenge of in-line inspection and failure analysis. And this ultimately, I believe, will translate to a longer yield ramp of 3D memory, as well as longer time before 3D memories become applicable across a broad range of applications. So that's certainly a challenge of 3D memory, I believe, they will take longer time before they really become worthy of meaningful, cost-effective production due to the challenges of in-line inspection and failure analysis and manufacturing aspects. But certainly on the other hand, 3D NAND memories will have new failure mechanisms, which will certainly require system expertise, controller expertise to really productize them and make them meaningful volume production technologies. And this is where SanDisk for 25 years has really, from day 1, focused on system expertise, all of the system expertise that we have, the lead system expertise, I believe, best in the world system expertise that we have here for our 2D NAND memory, will be applicable to our 3D NAND memory, but it will then require even more system expertise because 3D NAND will have its own unique considerations. And again, SanDisk's experience in system expertise will be able to extend, I believe, more readily in 3D memory. So you are correct that in-line inspection is a challenge on wafer manufacturing side. And you are also correct that controller expertise is going to be a key to make 3D into a viable production-worthy technology.", "Operator", "And that comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.", "Gabriel Ho", "This is Gabriel for Ambrish Srivastava. I have a quick question regarding the MCP. So we understand the MCP is one of the fastest grower in Q2 and is used in the lower-cost smartphone, which is the fastest grower within the smartphone segment, so does that put you in a disadvantage since you did not manufacture your captive DRAM supply?", "Judy Bruner", "As we've said a number of times, we do earn a lower-than-average gross margin percentage on our MCP products because we source the mobile DRAM on a non-captive basis. But we do still earn very good overall gross margin dollars from our MCP products. Of course, they have a higher cost, but they also have a higher price than our average. And the real value of the MCP for us is in the iNAND. These are all MCP iNAND products. And so we really are getting paid for the iNAND in these products. And keep in mind, we had a fairly significant increase in our MCP iNAND sales in the second quarter and still posted a very big increase in our gross margin.", "Gabriel Ho", "I see. As a follow up, could you also we remind us, what is your bit -- what is your wafer growth assumption for the 2014, given your range of 25% to 35% bit growth?", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. I had indicated at our Investor Day that for this year, for 2013, that with productivity improvements we expect to achieve about 2.6 million wafers for the year. And that for next year, for 2014, our estimate is between 2.6 million and 2.8 million wafers.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Craig Ellis of B. Riley.", "Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division", "Judy, just a follow-up on the CapEx comment, looks like there is a minor decrease in the planned CapEx for the year. What's that attributable to?", "Judy Bruner", "Nothing real significant. It's just getting more granular on our estimates and the timing of various tech transition spending.", "Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division", "Okay. And then switching gears on the downstream inventory side. Can you just describe how you currently perceive downstream inventories? And related to an earlier question in environments like this where there is such a high degree of tightness in the market, we often see double ordering, how does the team ensure that that's not impacting shipments that head out the door?", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. We get very frequent reporting of our retail channel inventory and we believe we have good visibility of the distributor channel inventory related to our commercial channels. And we don't see anything unusual in any of those areas. The channel inventory remains healthy and relatively lean in both our retail channel and the OEM channels that we do utilize.", "Operator", "And we'll hear from Steven Fox with Cross Research.", "Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC", "Just one question, just tying together some of the comments around sales timings and account -- versus account receivable and some of the comments you made about what changed since the Analyst Day. The strength in the second half of the quarter, I guess, sounds like there is retail seasonality, but breaking it down further, I was curious if there is anything you would comment on relative to the general health of the demand in your core markets versus, say, just product cycles and sort of ASP momentum? And then if you could carry that through for the rest of the year, if you're seeing anything outside the ordinary of seasonality in your new guidance?", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. I don't think that there were any issues in terms of health of the demand and the timing of the revenue that we were -- that we experienced in the second quarter. As you indicated, you're right that the sell-through timing of the retail business tends to be more in the second half of the second quarter and we did experience that. And then relative to our commercial channels, the revenue was also more weighted to the second half. But it appears to just have been relative to the needs of our various OEM customers, their product launches, their product timing and I do not see anything unusual. Our accounts receivable, by the way, is very high quality and very current accounts receivable. I don't think there is any indication of demand issue. Relative to the rest of the year, I haven't seen anything that would cause me to think that the timing or seasonality of our revenue would be different than historical.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan.", "Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Your average gigabit per unit shipped almost doubled on a year-over-year basis for the second consecutive quarter. Was most of that driven by a higher mix of embedded or did you see average capacity going up across most of your segments and do you think you can sustain this type of capacity growth going forward?", "Judy Bruner", "Both are true. We saw good average, very strong, average capacity growth really across all of the key product segments that we sell. But in addition, of course, mix also played a factor. As year-over-year, the embedded mix of our business has grown significantly and that tends to be higher average capacity than some of the removable products. And -- but in particular, SSDs, grew significantly in mix and those of course, have the highest average capacity. So we are seeing a good mix effect in that average capacity. But we are seeing very strong growth in the really all of the different product lines. I mean, including imaging and USBs and even commercial card type products.", "Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Great. And then on your client SSD business, does the team expect that to contribute to quarter-on-quarter growth in Q3? And you've got the partnership with Western Digital targeting hybrid drives. How does the team view the adoption of hybrid drives versus full-blown SSDs as we move through the second half? And given the rollout of these new Gen 3 ultrabooks?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We certainly do expect quarter-over-quarter increases in our SSD revenue from Q2 to Q3 and we expect SSD revenue to be increasing percentage of our business in the second half. And regarding the hybrid, hybrid opportunity really is just beginning. It is too early. 2013, we do not expect much contribution from hybrid drive. Flash -- flash sold by us -- flash solutions sold by us for hybrid drive. But we certainly expect that to increase in 2014 time frame. And as new Haswell platforms are launched and sold in the channel in second half of this year, that certainly bodes well for Client SSD drives because, Haswell platforms will give a longer battery life, and that should be a nice appeal to drive growth of Client SSD and ultra-thin notebook category.", "Operator", "And moving on, we'll hear from Steven Chin of UBS.", "Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Two quick ones for me. First one is on your mobile embedded business. I was wondering if you could provide some color on what the average capacity might be for, I guess, your iNAND versus your iNAND MCP [ph] products and I was wondering if you have any visibility on demand content going to lower-cost smartphones versus premium smartphones?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "In MCP, the average capacity of flash tends to be lower. MCPs tend to be used in volume more in the budget smartphone or mid-range as well. And discrete iNAND tends to be more in the midrange and high-end smartphones. So that tends to have higher average capacity. And if you -- we don't break it out separately between, I mean, we draw that color here, but if you look at the total embedded average capacity, it is close to our corporate average.", "Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Got it. And my second question is regarding [indiscernible] drives and other enterprise-related flash products. Just with the SMART Storage deal you're ready to close sometime this quarter, also your Pliant acquisition a couple of years ago also running smoothly right now. Can you provide any color on your target for when overall enterprise sales might reach 5% or 10% of sales?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We are not really breaking it out between client and enterprise. As we mentioned that in 2014, we expect our clients plus Enterprise SSD sales to be 25% of our total revenue. And we are making really great progress on both, on Client SSD, as well as Enterprise SSDs. Client SSDs are, in total, revenue larger than Enterprise SSD revenue but we have strong momentum in both of them.", "Operator", "And that question will come from Kevin Cassidy of Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Dean Grumlose - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "This is Dean Grumlose calling in for Kevin. I was wondering if you could provide some color around the outlook for the company's long-term target model as you shift more towards embedded and SSD products? Is this increase in margin less sustainable over time? And how may the corporate targets change as you progressed?", "Judy Bruner", "Sure, Dean. I don't know if you're aware, but I did just adjust and increase the long-term financial model at our recent Investor Day in May. And I did increase the gross margin range of that model, as well as the OpEx range because it does require more OpEx to be investing in some of these product areas, in particular the solid-state solutions. And we are also investing heavily in our three-pronged memory technology strategy. But net-net, I did increase the operating margin range by 100 basis points to 21% to 25%. And I said at the time that I thought there is long-term potential to further increase our long-term financial model as, in particular, SSDs and somewhat embedded but more SSDs and enterprise, in particular, becomes a larger portion of our model. So I do think there is that longer-term potential to further adjust the model. But of course, at this point, we did just adjust it and it's too soon to talk about further adjustments to that model. But I do think there is upside to gross margin and to operating margin as our mix further evolves.", "Brendan Lahiff", "Thank you, everyone. We want to thank everybody for joining our call today. A webcast replay of today's call should be available on our Investor Relations website shortly. Thank you, and have a good evening.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, again, that does conclude today's conference.

SanDisk assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, which speak as of today.", "And finally, I'd like to inform you that we are planning for our Fourth Quarter 2013 Results Earnings Call on Wednesday, January 22, 2014.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Sanjay.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Thank you, Jay. Good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report outstanding third quarter results with record revenue and excellent growth in operating margins. We achieved these results through continued strong execution on our strategy of shifting the portfolio to a higher-value solution. We grew our Client and Enterprise SSD revenue, which, together, contributed 20% of quarterly revenue. We delivered strong performance in our embedded products and our retail channel grew in both emerging and developed markets. We closed the acquisition of SMART Storage Systems, which has significantly strengthened our Enterprise Storage Portfolio. Our excellent third quarter achievements keep us on track to deliver record 2013 results.", "Turning to SSDs. Our client SSDs delivered record revenue for the fourth quarter in a row. The Client SSD market continues to grow, driven by growing customer preference for high-performance, instant-on capabilities of devices in thin and sleek form factors. SanDisk Client SSDs are now qualified at all the major PC OEMs. We also saw strong acceptance of our high-performance 19-nanometer client PCIe SSDs. We continue to invest in improving our product capabilities and customer engagements to further build upon our growing share in Client SSDs.", "In Enterprise SSDs, we achieved sequential revenue growth to deliver yet another record quarter. Our growth has enabled us to establish SanDisk as a leader in the enterprise SAS market. We are pleased to have closed the SMART Storage Systems acquisition and we welcome the new employees to the SanDisk team. The acquisition brings us new enterprise customers and SanDisk Enterprise SSDs are now qualified at 6 of the top 7 storage OEMs.", "In addition to expanding our SAS product offerings, the SMART Storage Systems acquisition also enables us to serve a 1.7 billion TAM for enterprise set of products. We are excited about the potential synergies that we can drive in our portfolio of Enterprise and Client SSDs by leveraging SMART Storage Systems Guardian Technology.", "Following the close of the acquisition, we have been reviewing our overall Enterprise SSD roadmap. And I want to highlight some of our conclusions. We have determined that SMART Storage Systems' Enterprise SSD product architecture is more scalable than our existing platform with significant headroom to drive new features and higher levels of performance and endurance that our Enterprise customers require. Therefore, we plan to implement the Guardian Technology into more of the Enterprise products in our roadmap. Simultaneously, we are accelerating investments in UltraDIMM, a new product category aimed at the high-performance, low latency market, which, thus far, has been served mostly by PCIe-based products. Ultra-DIMM SSDs place NAND flash memory on DIMMs, very close to the processor, enabling lower latency and higher storage densities per server for high performance computing applications.", "We believe the combined Enterprise product roadmap from SMART Storage and SanDisk significantly strengthens our portfolio and broadens the range of opportunities we can address, spanning Fortune 500 IP infrastructure to the hyper scale data centers.", "As we review the progress on our next-generation 12-gigabit SAS platform, based on the client technology, we have concluded that the expected launch of our 12-gigabit SAS SSD product will be delayed. The related enterprise PCIe product will also be impacted. The 12-gigabit SAS SSD products are expected to be released around mid-2014 and we believe that our SAS product portfolio will continue to lead the industry. We expect to introduce a high-performance enterprise PCIe product in 2014. We also plan to address the high-performance, low latency market with our UltraDIMM product, which we are already sampling to OEMs to initiate their driver development and system integration activities.", "Overall, with our broadening portfolio of products and customer engagement in the Client, as well as the Enterprise SSD market, we are on a trajectory to exceed our 2013 goal to deliver 15% of our revenue from SSDs and we remain on track to deliver 25% of our revenue from SSDs in 2014. SanDisk is also continuing to drive innovation in use cases for NAND flash to our ventured investments and we are pleased with the strategic benefits we have realized from the SanDisk ventured initiative, thus far.", "We expect the Enterprise Storage Market will continue to see rapid innovation and growth and SanDisk with its strategic advantages, including deep enterprise storage expertise, software capabilities and vertical integration, is well positioned to provide leadership in this space. Our mobile product revenue represented 47% of quarterly revenue with the largest portion driven by our embedded solutions.", "SanDisk has made significant inroads into the rapidly growing mid- and low-tier smartphone segments with our iNAND embedded flash and iNAND MCP offerings, further building upon our strong presence with global smartphone and tablet OEMs. Smartphone and tablet OEMs in China are eager to capture the growing mobile opportunity and their products are being launched with strong technical specifications and growing average storage capacities.", "Additionally, industry trends in mobile are now showing new use cases that can increase local storage needs. For example, the introduction of 4K and 120 frames per second video capability, increasing adoption of burst mode in mobile devices and recent offerings from content providers that drive more usage of local storage are trends which bode well for the average capacity increases in smartphones.", "Retail had an excellent quarter, driven by the back-to-school season and solid execution in all regions. Product innovation and leadership momentum remains high with the introduction of the world's fastest and highest capacity SanDisk Extreme Pro CompactFlash Card at 256 gigabytes and the SanDisk Extreme PRO CFast 2.0 product line, new products that are suitable for high-end broadcast, cinema and pro video market.", "We also launched a new family of SanDisk Connect products that allow consumers to better manage mobile content and media, as well as to stream this content to multiple devices simultaneously. Our well-recognized and trusted brand, innovative and broad retail product offerings, global presence and strong supply chain execution position us well for continuing strength and further gains in the retail channel.", "Turning to manufacturing. As of the third quarter, our 19-nanometer technology has fully ramped. We also commenced the ramp of our 1Y technology with X2, as well as X3 memory, and we have already shipped product to customers based on that technology. We expect 1Y to achieve cost crossover with 19-nanometer in the fourth quarter and we estimate approximately 15% of our production output to be on 1Y exiting the year.", "In memory technology, we are making excellent progress in scaling to the 1Z node and expect to target production starts in late 2014. We continue to believe that our 1Y and 1Z 2D NAND nodes will position us well for accessing a broad range of applications and market opportunities in 2013 and 2015. From a future technology perspective, as we progress with our BiCS NAND development, our efforts are focused on modifying certain aspects of our memory architecture and related process technology to optimize for manufacturability, scalability, cost and product specifications targeting a broader range of applications. We continue to target pilot production of BiCS NAND in 2015 and volume ramp of product in 2016.", "Switching to supply. We estimate that 2013 industry bit supply growth to be approximately 40%, with relatively similar expectations for 2014 as well. We continue to expect SanDisk 2013 bit supply growth will be approximately 20%. And that our 2014 bit supply growth will be between 25% and 35%. The industry bit growth estimates include assumptions of 2D NAND transitions, new wafer capacity additions, as well as conversions of from DRAM wafer capacity to NAND, and early production of 3D NAND. We believe that demand drivers for the industry will continue to be strong and that the fundamentals of the industry will remain healthy in 2014.", "To summarize, we are very pleased to have reported outstanding third quarter results and we are looking forward to a strong finish to 2013. We are focused on executing to our technology strategy, driving our ongoing portfolio shift to higher-value solutions, prudently managing our capacity and creating shareholder value.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Judy for her financial review and outlook.", "Judy Bruner", "Thank you, Sanjay. Q3 was an outstanding quarter with 28% year-over-year revenue growth, 50% non-GAAP gross margin and 33% non-GAAP operating margin. In addition, we retired 15.7 million shares and we made our first-ever dividend payment. And today, we announced our fourth quarter dividend. Our record revenue of $1.625 billion was comprised of year-over-year growth in gigabytes sold of 14% and a year-over-year increase in blended ASP per gigabyte of 12%. While our prudent capacity management has contributed to a strong supply-demand for our business, the biggest driver of our year-over-year price increase has been the mix shift in our sales towards embedded and SSD solution. In addition, we have increased the mix of our high-performance retail products and we have reduced the mix of non-branded sales.", "On a sequential basis, our third quarter gigabytes sold grew 15% and our ASP per gigabyte decreased 3%. For the 9 months of 2013 compared to the same period of 2012, our blended ASP per gigabyte is unchanged, benefiting from the improving mix of our portfolio and careful attention to managing our capacity to meet demand.", "Our third quarter revenue mix between commercial and retail customers remained constant, sequentially, at a mix of 65% commercial and 35% retail. Our retail revenue grew 11% sequentially and 18% year-over-year with sequential growth strongest in USB drives and year-over-year growth strongest in mobile cards. On a year-over-year basis, our retail revenue has grown nicely in all major regions and we believe that we have gained share globally. Our commercial revenue grew 10% sequentially and 33% year-over-year with the mix of our commercial sales shifting significantly towards embedded and SSD products. Within our Q3 total revenue, we achieved a record 50% mix from SSD and Embedded Solutions.", "On a year-over-year basis, our blended cost-per-gigabyte declined 19% compared to our price increase of 12%, resulting in non-GAAP gross margin increasing from 31% in Q3 of last year to 50% this Q3. On a sequential basis, our non-GAAP gross margin increased 340 basis points with cost decline of 10% compared to price decline of 3%. The sequential cost improvement and related margin expansion came primarily from a more favorable yen rate in our cost of sales; an increased usage of 19-nanometer supply, driven by our portfolio mix; and lower period costs.", "In Q3, the yen rate in our cost of sales was 93 compared to 85 in the second quarter. And the 19-nanometer mix in our sales increased to over 85% compared to less than 80% in Q2. Our Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses increased $22 million sequentially to $282 million with the increases coming from 3 primary areas: First, the addition of SMART Storage Systems from August 22 through the end of our quarter; second, an increased investment in memory technology and systems engineering; and third, an increased investment in sales and marketing for the commercial channel.", "In our GAAP expenses, in addition to the usual stock compensation and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, we have recorded an $83 million impairment of the intangible assets from our Pliant acquisition. This stems primarily from our decision to integrate more the SMART Storage Systems' architecture and technology into our future enterprise product roadmap, and to some extent, from the delay of our next-generation SSD platform built on the Pliant technology. There is $41 million of Pliant intangible assets remaining on the balance sheet, which will be amortized to expense between now and the end of 2014.", "Our Q3 non-GAAP operating margin increased sequentially from 29% to 32.8%, resulting in record quarterly non-GAAP net income and we delivered a substantial increase in EPS on both a non-GAAP and GAAP basis.", "I want to mention that in our non-GAAP share count, we are now including the expected impact of the bond hedge we carry on our convertible debt, which will provide an offset to the shares ultimately issued for the convertible notes at maturity in 2017. While the effect of the bond hedge cannot be included in GAAP diluted shares until it is exercised at maturity, we believe it makes sense to include this in non-GAAP diluted shares and we have reflected this in our Q3 non-GAAP results and retroactively adjusted our Q2 non-GAAP shares downward by 1.6 million.", "A schedule available on the Investor Relations web page of our website outlines the share dilution expected from the convertible debt at various stock prices showing the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP share count. And this schedule has also been updated to account for the impact of the dividends paid to date.", "Turning to cash flow, our cash flow from operations was $382 million and we spent $51 million on capital equipment, resulting in free cash flow of $331 million. We utilized a net $304 million of cash for the SMART Storage Systems acquisition; $1.07 billion for share repurchase, which includes an open ASR contract; and $51 million for our Q3 dividend. Our joint venture fab equipment investments in Q3 were $227 million with no cash contributions required. On a year-to-date basis, our joint venture fab equipment investments have been $407 million and all payments have been funded by the joint ventures with cash of $73 million received by us in repayment of our joint venture and notes receivable. The joint ventures have not utilized any equipment leases so far this year and our off balance sheet fab equipment lease guarantees have been reduced to $565 million.", "I will now turn to forward-looking commentary.", "We expect our fourth quarter revenue to be between $1.65 billion and $1.725 billion, reflecting continued healthy demand with blended price declines somewhat higher than in Q3 due in part to a higher mix of holiday retail sales. Our strong Q3 revenue, coupled with the Q4 revenue expectation brings our full year 2013 revenue forecast above the high end of our previous estimates.", "We forecast our fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 48% to 50%. We expect fourth quarter sequential cost reduction to be less than we experienced in the third quarter, as our 19-nanometer sales mix is not expected to grow, the 1Y nanometer contribution to Q4 cost reduction will still be small and the sequential improvement from the yen will be less in Q4 than it was in Q3.", "Our expected yen rate in Q4 cost of sales is slightly below 97. We expect expenses to increase in the fourth quarter due to a full quarter of expenses from the addition of SMART Storage Systems, seasonal marketing expenses, and increases in R&D expenses, some of which will be nonrecurring. Our Q4 non-GAAP expense forecast is $310 million to $320 million, including approximately $15 million of one-time and seasonal expenses. We expect our tax rate to remain about the same and we expect our diluted non-GAAP share count to decline by approximately 3 million shares as we benefit from a full weighting of our third quarter share repurchases. We expect an increase in capital investments in Q4 for 1Y transition equipment at the fab joint ventures and for manufacturing equipment within SanDisk, bringing gross capital investments to the year to between $1 billion and $1.1 billion", "Q4 cash usage for these investments is expected to be in the range of $125 million to $150 million, bringing full year cash usage to $250 million or less. In summary, we believe our strong results reflect a broadened portfolio with increasing penetration into high-value solutions, strong execution on technology transitions and prudent management of capacity. We believe 2013 will set a record for us in terms of revenue, non-GAAP net income and cash flow from operations. And we are very pleased to have utilized a substantial portion of this cash flow to increase total shareholder return through our share repurchases and our dividend payments.", "We will now open the call for your questions.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Judy. Thank you, Sanjay. Alise, if you could poll the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions]", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.", "John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Sanjay, you talked about in your prepared comments your expectation for SanDisk's supply growth next year of between 25% and 30%. I'm kind of curious what's the CapEx number we should think about that's embedded within that? And as we think about your ability to mix up, how should we think about the potential for mix up allowing revenue growth to accelerate above and beyond just bit growth?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So first of all, bit growth guidance that we provided for next year is 25% to 35%. Judy can comment on the CapEx aspect. And of course, our focus is to continue to strengthen the mix of our solutions offerings during the course of the year. SSD revenue approaching 25%, 25% is our target for next year, will certainly contribute toward our revenue shares outperforming our bit shares. And I will let Judy comment on the CapEx.", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. While it's too early to provide any specific CapEx guidance for next year, we do expect our CapEx investment to go up in 2014 relative to 2013 and the primary reason would be, that there will be more investment in technology transition in 2014 and, specifically, in the 1Y transition, which as we've described before, has a higher capital cost than the 19-nanometer transition did.", "John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Perfect, that's helpful. And then Sanjay, as my follow-up, you talked about, again, in the prepared comments, new applications in the mobile space like 4K and 120 frames per second. I'm kind of curious, when do you think those acquisitions will actually have a tangible impact in moving up sort of the densities in the smartphone market? And as we look out 12 months from now, where do you think the average density per smartphone will be versus where we are today?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "In terms of -- some of the features that are -- have typically been only in the premium smartphones in the past, now some of those features are moving toward the mid-and the low-end range of the smartphones as well. And those are actually driving higher average capacities in the mid- to low-end range. I'm excited about some of the offerings related to 4K video capability, as well as some of the content offerings by content providers, such as YouTube and Amazon where you can download content to the device and watch it several hours later. These are all start of the trends. Of course, this is all very much in the beginning, it will take a while for all these trends to really proliferate across multiple product offering by multiple suppliers. But this is how this industry has really driven innovation and has flash -- and as time and again showed that's how it is really a strategic component in terms of enabling such features. In terms of the average capacities, average capacities from 2013 to 2016 time frame are expected to double in smartphone category. So I think, we have some exciting opportunities ahead for flash usage in smartphones.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets.", "Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Having just guided to record numbers, is there any reason or anything that you would like us to think about that would keep you from reporting yet another record year next year?", "Judy Bruner", "I would say that as we said in our prepared remarks, we expect that the industry will have strong fundamentals in 2014. And we're very optimistic about our own business in terms of continued improvement of our portfolio mix and broadening of our portfolio. And we're working very hard to continue to optimize the combination of revenue growth, profits and cash flow. And so as we sit here today, we are optimistic about 2014.", "Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And as my follow-up, when I look at the overall industry and the profits that are generated by the manufacturers versus those of their customers, it would seem that the customers still have the upper hand and, yet, that balance of power is shifting. How do you deal with that? And how is your pricing power impacted? As well as when we look at the slowdown in your cost per bit declines, does it allow you to sit on inventory longer to maybe manage your output to use it when the market demand is there?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "In terms of our engagement with the customers, certainly, as we continue to deliver leading-edge solutions and leveraging our system expertise to really bring value to our customers in terms of performance of the products, in terms of the reliability and the endurance aspect, these are the things we -- that make us a valued supplier to our customers. And of course, we work closely with our customers to also understand their future roadmap, to make sure that our products are well-aligned to their needs. And I think you are seeing the benefit of what SanDisk is able to bring to the customers. Our diversified growth portfolio of customers and our strengthening mix of solutions, I think you are seeing the benefits of all that translate into the results that we have produced this year and over last few quarters. And I really believe that SanDisk is in the best position in regard to really addressing the needs of the customers and really delivering value. The latest example, of course, is what we are doing on the Enterprise side, not only through high-performance, cost-optimized, as well as higher-reliability hardware solutions. But also bringing greater value opportunities to them through software capabilities. So these are all the things that we are focused on and ultimately, these are certainly leading to a consistent business model for us, as well as a strengthening of the business fundamentals for us. Regarding your question on inventory, maybe Judy can answer.", "Judy Bruner", "Yes. I just wanted to add on your question on inventory. We work very hard and I think we've done an excellent job this year to manage our capacity to the demand requirements that we see from our customers. And so I would not say that we would manage our inventory by sitting on inventory, but really rather by managing that supply-demand balance within our business. However, I will tell you that from time-to-time, yes, we do hold inventory for the most strategic needs for that inventory. And so we're very careful in terms of how we allocate that precious inventory to our customer base.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "First question on supply-demand. Last time, Judy and Sanjay, you guys laid out your assumptions now that there was a fire and -- at SK Hynix. They stopped some of the transition to NAND. What does that do to your supply-demand assumptions near term and as you head into next year, was my first question. Second, with the acquisition of SMART, you were sticking with the 25% target for next year. What are the puts and takes with Pliant being delayed a little bit and SMART should help you ramp to that? So if you could please throw some light on those 2?", "Judy Bruner", "So in terms of the impact of the fire, I would say that, of course, the main impact is on the DRAM market, not on the NAND market. And I would add that we have multiple sources of our mobile DRAM, and we feel that we have adequate supply of our mobile DRAM. Relative to the impact on the NAND industry, in the near term -- near to medium term, we do believe that this has some dampening effect on the growth of NAND bits in the industry as there will be, perhaps, somewhat less conversion of DRAM to NAND because of this. But in the longer term, and in particular for 2014 overall, we think it has relatively minimal affect on the NAND supply growth.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "On the SSD question, Enterprise SSD question that you asked, so for next years, in terms of our target of 25% of revenue coming from SSDs, that's a sum of Client SSDs and Enterprise SSDs. We do expect Client SSDs to be larger next year also in terms of total revenue. Enterprise SSD will have the fastest growth, larger growth rate on a year-over-year basis in 2014 compared to the Client SSD. So we are very excited about our growth in Enterprise SSDs. With the acquisition of SMART Storage, of course, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are now able to bring out Enterprise SATA SSDs to the customers. And we will certainly be expecting revenue increase in Enterprise SSD coming from SATA SSDs. We also have expanded our storage OEM customer base from 4 leading customers to 6 customers. That's exciting opportunity for us. And of course, broader portfolio of SAS offerings will also position us well for 2014. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks about a new, unique product category for SanDisk, which is UltraDIMM, they'll be engaging in -- with customers in terms of sampling and there's initial evaluation. And I would expect that to also start contributing to revenue some time towards the second half of next year. So I think on Enterprise, we are well prepared to drive our growth on SAS and Enterprise SATA SSDs and focused on also evolving our product roadmap for PCIe solutions.", "Operator", "We'll go next to James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Judy, I was wondering if you could address the cost-improvement situation into Q4? Obviously, the yen is less of a benefit than it was in Q3. Would you expect the yen to still be a bigger portion of the cost improvement relative to the 1Y output transition going into Q4?", "Judy Bruner", "Yes. I think the impact of 1Y on cost improvement in Q4 will really be pretty negligible, because it will be primarily the 1Y that we produced in the third quarter that will impact cost of sales in the fourth quarter. So the fourth quarter cost-reduction capability will be less than it was in the third quarter definitely. And the primary impact or the primary factor in the fourth quarter will be the improvement in the yen rate in our fourth quarter cost of sales.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful. And then maybe looking out into 2014, I guess you're running 19%, 20% cost reduction for 2013. Do you think that you can beat those numbers going into 2014, given that you're going to have pretty much the full runway of the 1Y transition in hand for next year?", "Judy Bruner", "No. I expect, in fact, that cost reduction will likely be slower in 2014 than it has been in 2013. And keep in mind that in our 2013 cost reduction, we have had a very significant boost from the weakening of the yen in 2013 relative to 2012. And we don't expect that to repeat in 2014. Of course, we expect that -- we're not necessarily expecting that the yen changes much from where it is, but we don't expect to get the kind of boost in 2014 that we did receive this year.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I'm sorry, I meant to clarify, excluding the yen benefit, would you expect yen x cost improvement to be better or worse?", "Judy Bruner", "Excluding the yen benefit in terms -- you're saying 1Y relative to 19-nanometer?", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Right.", "Judy Bruner", "Right, so not necessarily a big difference there in terms of 1Y cost reduction versus 19-nanometer cost reduction. However, another factor in the overall cost reduction for 2014 is the mix of the products that we're selling. And as I said before, increasingly, the mix of the products we're selling are influencing the ASP per gigabyte statistics and the cost per gigabyte statistics. So as you think about 2014 and think about, for example, our SSD mix increasing, that SSD product has a higher cost per gigabyte. And so that will cause some dampening of the cost reduction statistic that you see. I wanted to also keep in mind, overall, that inherently, 1Y has less cost reduction than 19-nanometer. However, we did not ramp 19-nanometer as much in 2013 as we will ramp 1Y in 2014. So when you take those 2 effects into account, I think the transition cost improvement is relatively similar in the 2 years.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company.", "Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Can you talk a little bit about, Sanjay, about the bit impact from 3D next year? Some of your peers have been talking about something like a 20% to 30% incremental bit-per-wafer impact from their 3D on 24 layer. And then as they scale up, it'll be something in the range of like 60% incremental bits per wafer. Does that sound plausible to you?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "I think 3D NAND in the industry next year will have a very small impact in terms of bit growth, because the total volume of wafers that will be produced in 3D NAND would be very small compared to the large installed base of the 2D NAND wafers. Of course, it is also already acknowledged by a competitor that some of the early 3D NAND generations that will be in production next year will not really be cost competitive with the 2D NAND. And their bit growth capability will also not be really that strong to provide meaningful benefit. So given all of that, I do not expect in 2014 3D will have any material impact in terms of the total bit production in the industry. By the way, that is already estimates of 3D wafer production in the industry by competitor are taken into account off our estimations of approximately 40% year-over-year supply bit growth in 2014.", "Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "And then as a follow-up, Judy, you talked about 15% to 20% -- or 15% to 25% cost reduction in the next few years. It sounds like next year might be a bit less than it was this year. Are you going to still be within that range next year?", "Judy Bruner", "I think it's too early to give a specific range for cost reduction next year. But I would expect to be in the lower end of what we've talked about for next year. And again, I want to remind you as I said a few minutes ago that the mix plays a big factor in what the cost reduction statistic actually turns out to be. SSD mix, MCP products, those type of products all carry a higher cost per gigabyte.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Craig Ellis with B. Riley.", "Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division", "Judy and Sanjay, you've both mentioned the positive impact of mix on the business and the potential for further benefit as you go through next year. Can you just rank the top 3 or 4 mix drivers that you have in the portfolio as you look out through the end of 2014?", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. Probably the growth of the Enterprise business is the biggest factor in terms of positively influencing the gross margin from a mix perspective. I would also mention that we are actually improving the gross margin even within each of our product lines. So it's not just a product line to product line mix effect. But we have improved the gross margin in our retail business. We have improved the gross margin in our embedded business. We've improved the gross margin in our Client SSD business. And so there are mix effects that we are managing even within each of those areas. It could be moving the consumer to higher-performance products. It can be introducing a new product that has a better gross margin and demonstrating the value to our customers.", "Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division", "So are you saying that, really, in every part of your portfolio, you feel like you've got positive mix dynamics going?", "Judy Bruner", "We certainly have had in 2013, yes. And I believe that a lot of those carry into 2014.", "Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division", "Okay. And then as the follow-up, congratulations on the accelerated stock repurchase program. How should we think about the company's intent to continue to utilize its free cash flow generation? At the Analyst Day, you put out a 70% repurchase target as a percent of free cash flow. How should we think about that target relative to what you've already done and could do?", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. I think, clearly, for this year when the year is over, it will show that we actually spent more than 70% of free cash flow on share repurchase, including the ASR that we put in place. Now that ASR will, perhaps, not completely close out until 2014. But we will have spent more money this year than 70% of free cash flow. Going forward in 2014, it is still our intent to spend approximately 70% of free cash flow on share repurchase. That may not be the exact number on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But that generally is still a guideline for us.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Mark Newman with Sanford.", "Mark C. Newman - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Talking about the technology migration, people have talked about how that's increasingly getting very, very difficult. I wondered if you could have a brief update on the schedule, how the technology migration is progressing for the 1Y. Is there anything that you expect to potentially further delay this? Or do you think there's some potential upside to the schedule there? If you could talk a little bit about that and the 1Z. And then also to 3D, is there any update to the 3D NAND schedule that you talked about before, which was, I believe, mass production by 2016? Is there any potential change to that schedule?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So regarding 1Y, we are actually very much on target with respect to our original plans for introducing the technology. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we already began production shipments of both X2- and X3-based products on 1Y technology, and we will be exiting the year with 15% of our production on 1Y technology. So 1Y technology, actually, is going very well. The yields on both X2 as well as at X3 are going well. And we expect to achieve cost crossover on a bit-cost basis in the fourth quarter. Regarding 1Z, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that's also going very well, and we will be introducing that technology late in 2014 per our original plans. So we are very much on track with our schedules on both 1Y, as well as 1Z. Regarding the 3D NAND, the bit technology you asked for, as we said before, we are on track for production -- meaningful production in 2016 time frame, with sampling and product line production earlier, sometime in 2015.", "Mark C. Newman - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Great. And just a quick follow-up, on the -- considering your mix is continuing to improve and considering the dynamics of the industry continue to be much stronger than they were in 2012 for the overall constraint on the supply side and demand continue to be pretty strong, ASP dynamics seem to be looking continued -- continues to look pretty good for next year. Do you think we might see flattish ASPs continuing for another few quarters and possibly through 2014 with a combination of those 2 things, the positive the mix up to more Enterprise SSD and constraints of supply continuing?", "Judy Bruner", "We're not going to provide pricing guidance for 2014. But we do agree that the -- we believe the supply-demand balance in the industry will remain healthy, and we're working very hard to maintain a very strong supply-demand balance within our own business. And as we said, we have had 0 price decline for our business on a -- 3 quarters year-to-date versus the same 3 quarters last year. And I -- by the way, I believe that is stronger than has been experienced in the industry and stronger than experienced by our competitors, in large part, because of our portfolio mix shifts, as well as our strong balance, our prudent capacity management. So we are optimistic about continued good fundamentals in 2014 but too early to give any specific price estimates. And I will mention, as you did, that the mix shift will continue to influence that statistic. The mix shift influences price statistics and cost statistics in addition to, obviously, influencing gross margin.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the side of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "It's actually Mehdi Hosseini, SIG. One question for you, Judy. What is the contribution of SMART into the Q4 guide?", "Judy Bruner", "Well, clearly, there is a nice increase in the revenue from the SMART business from Q3 to Q4, not only because Q3 included only a partial quarter of revenue and Q4 will be a full quarter of revenue, but also because that business is ramping and growing. So we're not going to break that down. But clearly, that is an increase in our Q4 revenue in terms of sequential quarter-on-quarter.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Sure. And one question for Sanjay, more of a longer-term and more of a hypothetical question. As you ramp some of the recent acquisitions, especially on the software side, do you foresee a scenario where SanDisk would be able to sell Enterprise SSD-related software on a competitor raw NAND? In other words, your software solution becomes independent and therefore, helps the Enterprise customers with some standardization and help increase your mind share for SanDisk.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We have said before that software is certainly an opportunity for us to be selling it on a standalone basis as well. And in that scenario, of course, standalone can work with SanDisk hardware but we would definitely aim for having it work for other manufacturer -- other suppliers' storage -- flash storage product offerings as well. So certainly, that is important. And that's important, we know, to our customers as well because they want to be able to make sure that a software solution that they use is not just tying them up with only our hardware solutions. But keep in mind that software does give us tremendous capability right now to be engaging with our customers in terms of understanding what are the various usage models and what we can do in terms of really enhancing our value proposition of combination of hardware and software to them. As we have said before, software really is extending our vertical integration, going all the way from silicon, flash memory silicon, system expertise at the controller and the firmware level and now, even extending our vertical integration even deeper with software. And as we have said before, vertical integration is key to really winning in the marketplace, particularly in the Enterprise Storage area.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "So what would it take for SanDisk to help us in investment community to quantify these opportunities? Because right now, we're all focused on bits 3D, this 3D and that and pricing per bit. But at some point, as you scale -- as you execute and scale the software piece and vertical integration model plays out, wouldn't it be more helpful to actually break it out so that we could better quantify the opportunities?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So software right now is too small for us to really break it out. But the real opportunity that you see for us that leveraging our Enterprise hardware capabilities, as well as software capabilities, ultimately translate into our SSD revenue and you're seeing that, that mix of the revenue is growing. And we have also talked about our Enterprise Storage revenue within the SSD total revenue growing faster. So I think this is how you really see the benefits of all the assets that we have in the Enterprise Storage area in our financial results.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.", "Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I was surprised on what your cost per bit came down in the quarter. I think I had about 4 points of improvement from the yen, and it looks like you're down around 10. You had mentioned in the prepared remarks the sort of lower period cost and I'm wondering what's driving that? What's -- is there a lower fixed cost? And should we think about that having a forward effect?", "Judy Bruner", "There was, in the third quarter, some impact from utilizing some inventory that had been previously reserved. This was not a real big number. But that was one of the contributors to lower period costs. And so we really just had a very efficient quarter in terms of the period costs. I would not necessarily expect that, that would continue in the fourth quarter. As I said earlier, we expect lower cost reduction in the fourth quarter than we experienced in the third quarter and that will come from several areas. One, we'll have less positive contribution from the yen in the fourth quarter, although it still will be positive. Also less benefit from technology transitions since the 19-nanometer is essentially fully ramped and we won't get much impact from 1Y. And one other factor I also want to mention is that in the fourth quarter, as we will be ramping revenue from the SMART SSD business as we discussed earlier, those products, of course, are still selling on non-captive memory today until those products get qualified by our customers on our own captive memory. So that, of course, is another factor in terms of a somewhat shallower rate of cost decline in the fourth quarter. But all of that is factored into our gross margin guidance.", "Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And then if you go back to the Q1 time frame, you had had an increase in cost sequentially as you had ramped up SSDs. And yet if I have the numbers right, you're running higher on SSDs now than you were then and you don't have to seem that same effect. Can you just kind of help us understand what the impact of the SSD number continuing to rise as in your cost per bit?", "Judy Bruner", "No. Actually, the quarter where we had a increase in cost, my recollection is that the biggest factor was an increasing mix of MCP products, multichip package products. But you're right, both SSDs, as well as MCPs, can't do carry a higher cost per NAND gigabyte and therefore, can sway those statistics somewhat. I think increasingly, it's less important to focus on the cost per gigabyte and ASP per gigabyte statistic in any given quarter and focus on the overall gross margin percentage and operating margin percentage. Because sometimes, in fact, even the cost statistic can be a bit at odds with what the gross margin result really is.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Michael Bressler with Kensico Capital.", "Michael Bressler", "My first question is on capital allocation. I followed the company for a long time and for a long period of time, there was a lot of cash in the balance sheet and there was a concern that they're -- it needed to be there for certain reasons. And then over the last year, there's been a change in how we allocate our free cash flow and then even we went on to the balance sheet to use some of our cash in a very aggressive ASR. Can you just walk me through why you're thinking changed and kind of what that means for the business going forward? And then I have a quick technical follow-up.", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. In terms of capital allocation, clearly, we have built our cash balances pretty significantly over the past 5 years. Our cash has grown through strong cash flow in the business. And at the same time, I believe we have improved the consistency of our business model, and we've grown in our confidence in our ability to deliver strong profits and cash flow going forward. And so, all of this, a stronger balance sheet, more consistency of our business model and our confidence in being able to deliver a strong business model going forward all played in to our belief that it made sense to utilize a significant portion of our cash to repurchase shares.", "Michael Bressler", "And then you said earlier that we would see 70% of free cash flow for buybacks. Did you mean that the dividend is incremental to that? Or was that meant to be total shareholder return?", "Judy Bruner", "Again, it will probably vary on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But generally, it is our objective to spend approximately 70% of free cash flow on the share repurchase and then there is the dividend as well.", "Michael Bressler", "Got it. And then on the technical side, can you elaborate a little bit on what X3 means in your product line? I think that as the business has changed, that technical aspect in the margin aspect has -- is sometimes glossed over. So can just maybe remind me what that really means and then -- and how it will impact the business going forward?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So X3 versus X2 means 3-bit-per-cell memory versus 2-bit-per-cell. So basically, it means that on a given wafer of flash memory, we are able to get more gigabytes with X3 memory compared to X2 or what others call MLC memory. So it gives you more gigabyte per wafer, which, with the same process technology, same wafer manufacturing cost, so essentially, it translates to lower costs on a per-gigabyte basis. With our system-level technologies, the controller and the firmware expertise that we applied to our products that use X3 memory, we are actually able to use the X3 memory to compete with competitors' X2 or MLC products. So hence, you can see the obvious benefits of X3 in terms of helping improve the margins because it's a lower-cost technology and we are able to build system-level products, which are able to sell at -- in the marketplace and compete with products that are based on -- MLC-based, the 2-bit-per-cell based solutions. So these are the benefits of X3 to us. It helps produce higher number of gigabytes from a given investment in wafer capacity. So it makes our investments more productive, provides higher ROI on the investments. It helps enable, obviously, higher level of bit growth with the same wafer level production. It gives lower costs per gigabyte, and when we are able to sell it at attractive prices, it helps us improve the margin profile as well.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.", "Brian C. Peterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "This is Brian Peterson with -- pitching in for Hans. Just a quick clarification on the yen-hedging strategy. Any intent to hedge beyond the fourth quarter to lock in the current rates? Or are we still just kind of playing that quarter-by-quarter?", "Judy Bruner", "Good question. We actually have begun to place some hedges across 2014. At this point, the percentage that we've hedged across 2014 is very small but it is likely that we will grow that somewhat as we -- during this quarter, as we approach 2014.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Brian. That concludes the call today. Thank you, Sanjay. Thank you, Judy. We want to thank everyone for joining our call today.

Welcome to Western Digital's First Quarter Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2014. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.", "Robert Blair", "I want to mention at the outset that we'll be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning growth in the storage industry, our position and opportunities in the industry, industry demand for the December quarter, our production levels and capital expenditures, customer response to our product offerings and our financial performance, including our financial results expectations for the December quarter. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-K filed with the SEC on August 19, 2013. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events.", "In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures.

The forward-looking guidance we provide during this call excludes amortization of intangibles related to insurance proceeds related to the Thailand flooding and expenses related to the acquisitions of HGST, VeloBit, sTec and Virident. Because the amount of these items is not fully known to us at this time, we are unable to provide guidance for, or a reconciliation to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures.", "[Operator Instructions] I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investors section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of today's call.", "I will now turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Milligan.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, Wolfgang Nickl will provide additional commentary on our September quarter results and our outlook for the December quarter.", "The Western Digital team performed well in the September quarter. Outstanding linearity again helped drive great operating results, including strong free cash flow generation. We posted gross margins above the midpoint of our model range and our earnings per share were well above the high end of our guidance. These results reflect continued strong execution by both our HGST and WD subsidiaries. We expect the TAM in the December quarter to be roughly flat with the September quarter. Longer term, we remain excited about the opportunity to address the 34% annual growth in data that we are forecasting through 2020.", "Our strong financial performance has enabled us to invest in and execute on a strategic plan that we first outlined a little more than a year ago at our Investor Day. At that time, we identified growth opportunities in the cloud, in thin and light devices and in the Connected Life for consumers and the small and home office market. In addition, we cited Enterprise Solid-State Storage as an evolving growth opportunity. We also defined the capital allocation program of returning 50% of free cash flow to shareholders and potentially investing the remainder in strategic growth opportunities. We have advanced each of these initiatives over the last year, putting ourselves in an even stronger position to create additional value through innovation and differentiation.", "First, in our core business. We are on track to launch our new 7-disk helium-based sealed-drive this quarter to a select group of customers who value the total cost of ownership savings delivered by this innovative product. We are participating in the thin and light ultra portable device opportunity with a strong lineup of solutions, including our solid-state hybrid drives, as well as our 7-millimeter and 5-millimeter hard drives.", "We recently introduced our My Cloud family of personal cloud solutions, which enable users to organize, centralize and access their digital content from anywhere in the world. And to further strengthen our participation in the fast-growing SOHO NAS space, we recently expanded our industry-leading family of WD Red NAS drives to include a 3.5-inch 4 terabyte drive and a 2.5-inch form factor.", "In returning capital to shareholders, we have delivered on our year ago announcement by allocating approximately $1.2 billion to share buybacks and dividend payouts. On the strategic investment front, we recently strengthened our enterprise storage platform, with several acquisitions related to the application of solid-state storage and data center architectures. SSD in the enterprise and cloud is forecasted by IDC to grow from $2.5 billion in 2012 to $7.2 billion in 2017. We entered the space in 2008 through our joint development agreement with Intel, and since then have established a strong position in SaaS SSD devices. Our recent acquisitions of sTec, VeloBit and Virident augment HGST's existing Enterprise SSD resources, including the Intel JDA. Collectively, these assets provide us with a powerful platform to address this evolving growth space with a broadened portfolio of products and technologies, including the full range of Enterprise SSD devices, PCIe, SAS and SATA. Mike Cordano, who heads our HGST subsidiary, will be discussing their data center strategy in the keynote address at the annual Needham storage conference on November 6.", "I will now turn the call over to Wolfgang to review the first quarter results and our outlook for the December quarter.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Thank you, Steve. We are very pleased with our September quarter performance, as we again demonstrated the consistency and strength of our business model, underpinned by great execution. The hard drive industry shipped approximately 139 million units during the September quarter, up from the June quarter and flat with the year ago period. The September TAM came in at the upper end of the guidance we gave in July.", "In our business, we saw strength in consumer electronics due to gaming, stable quarter-over-quarter performance in client and enterprise, and an anticipated seasonal pickup in branded products. Our distribution and retail channel inventory remains very lean, and our analysis suggests that inventory levels at our OEM customers remain at reasonable levels.", "Our revenue for the September quarter was $3.8 billion, including $106 million from Enterprise SSDs. Overall, 53% of our revenue came from non-PC applications. We shipped a total of 62.6 million hard drives at an average selling price of $58. The quarter-over-quarter change in overall ASP was primarily driven by a change in business and product mix.", "Our gross margin for the quarter was 28.6%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 29.8%, excluding $36 million of amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired from HGST, sTec and VeloBit, as well as $11 million of fixed asset impairments and other charges. We exceeded our implied guidance for non-GAAP gross margin by 70 basis points, primarily due to lower-than-expected price declines and better-than-expected cost improvement.", "R&D and SG&A spending totaled $533 million for the September quarter. SG&A included the following items: charges of $13 million related to the acquisitions of sTec, VeloBit and Virident, and $11 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST and sTec intangible assets, offset by a gain of $65 million for a flood-related insurance recovery. We incurred additional interest charges of $13 million in the September quarter relating to the accrued arbitration award.", "Tax expense for the September quarter was $37 million, or 7% of pretax income. Our net income for the September quarter totaled $495 million, or $2.05 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $514 million, or $2.12 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings per share, excluding sTec was $2.14, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.09.", "Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $680 million in cash from operations and our free cash flow totaled $544 million. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter with free cash flow in excess of $500 million. Our CapEx for the September quarter totaled $136 million, or 3.6% of revenue. Part of our capital allocation program, we repurchased 2.3 million shares for $150 million during the September quarter. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.25 per share or a total of $59 million during the quarter. We exited Q1 with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.9 billion of which $1.4 billion was in the U.S. During the quarter, we drew down the $500 million available to us through our revolving credit facility.", "I will now provide our guidance for the December quarter. We expect the total available market to be flat with the September quarter. Revenue in the range of $3.775 billion to $3.875 billion. Gross margin approximately flat with the prior quarter, excluding the amortization of intangibles. R&D and SG&A spending of approximately $595 million, including a full quarter of sTec and VeloBit, as well as 9.5 weeks of Virident and excluding the amortization of intangibles. Our tax rate was in our 7% to 10% model, and a share count of approximately $242 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.95 and $2.10 for the December quarter. This EPS guidance includes a dilutive effect from our recent acquisition of approximately $0.10. As a reminder, we expect the sTec, VeloBit and Virident acquisitions to be accretive early in calendar year 2015.", "In summary, we're pleased with our continued strong performance, and we are excited about our opportunity to play an increasingly strategic role in the evolving storage market.", "In my final call as CFO of Western Digital, I want to say that I greatly value my 18 years of experience and relationships at the company, including relationships with many of you in the investment community. Most importantly, I want to extend a special thank you to my fellow employees for the great teamwork in building such an outstanding company with such great promise.", "Operator, we're now ready to open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel.", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "The questions on -- as you look at the free cash flow generation, I know you mentioned 7 consecutive quarters at more than $500 million. As we look out going forward, do we believe that, that's a sustainable trend, especially now that we bring on the acquisitions that you guys have done? And how are you thinking about, I guess, in that context, that free cash flow generation? And any thoughts on changing whether or not the 50% return of that free cash flow is kind of -- enters into the equation with these acquisitions behind you?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "That's certainly the target, to keep the free cash flow up there, if we execute to our business model. Again, the acquisitions we're targeting to have accretive in the early part of calendar year '15. So we also think we have opportunities on the conversion cycle, for instance, on inventory turns. So it's clearly the objective and there is no change to the capital allocation strategy.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes, Aaron, this is Steve. Just to clarify one thing, when we're talking about free cash flow, we're defining it as exclusive of the acquisition itself, right?", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Of course.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Two questions. First, if we were to go and look at ASPs, excluding the consumer electronics impact, can you give us a sense on what that might be? Then I have a follow-up.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, I don't have the exact number here in front of me, Rich, but it's safe to assume that the majority of the ASP quarter-over-quarter change came from the gaming business that was included in the CE this quarter.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Would you also expect it to be material to the average gigs per chip?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "It reduces the average gigabyte chip.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then in terms of the acquisitions, given their impact here, would you expect that after the December quarter for the OpEx level to decline? I mean, are you basically assuming in the December quarter that you really haven't had a chance to rationalize those businesses? And then any comments on product roadmap rationalization are we even -- know what they're offering today on how you're going to combine the, really, 4 SSD entities in terms of products available to the public.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, I'll take the first part. We said when we announced the Virident acquisitions that our OpEx will peak somewhere in the 595, 590 range. That's where we are right now. We're going to be realizing some savings there over time. We're going to be very prudent to make sure that we're not impacting the roadmap. And I'll let Steve talk about the second part of the question.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes, Rich, given that, particularly, the Virident transaction just closed last week, we are still in the process of rationalizing the roadmap for the various product lines, so no update at this point on that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "I guess, this is for Steve and for Wolfgang, what would need to happen or how would you guys envision dynamics taking place going forward? [indiscernible] the gross margin because of the higher end of the range, and what would be the confluence you think you should get to gross margin to the higher -- and I guess the upper half of the range over time? And I have a follow-up, as well.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes, that's an interesting question, sort of difficult to answer in a real straightforward way because generally, the thing that has driven gross margins up to the higher end of the range is supply-and-demand imbalances. And so obviously, we need to see some sort of a pickup from a demand perspective, and then presumably a supply constraint. We don't see that at present. But nevertheless, if we look at our margin performance, we're actually very pleased that our margins are where they're at and in an environment with, frankly, pretty sluggish demand, a pretty flat TAM that we've seen over several quarters. And so that's a testimony to the effort of our teams in terms of bringing down cost, managing mix and also moderating pricing pressure that we've seen.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "And then if I could just follow up on that. With regard to capacity utilization, as we sort of think into 2014, calendar 2014, can you give us some sense of how you guys, strategically, are thinking about managing your capacity, say, in an environment where, for instance, be a flattish environment going through '14? Would you look to hold it flat? Would you look to actually -- do you think to increase capacity utilization? How do you guys are thinking about it?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "We've been very proactive in terms of managing our capacity. Our infrastructure and our capacity utilization to the reduced TAM environment that we've seen over the last several quarters in terms of -- because the TAM was $160 million, $170 million in that range. Now it's in the, call it, $135 million to $140 million. And so we're keeping a close eye on that in terms of where that might go. And if for some reason or another the TAM were to contract, we would again take proactive measures to make sure that we're managing our capacity appropriately. And right now, we don't have any plans to expand our capacity until we begin to see some indication that the market's going to pick up that would support that.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.", "Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Can you guys give us some more color on what you saw in terms of enterprise demand during the quarter, particularly in the business-critical segment and how you're thinking about that going into the fourth quarter?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes, demand in the enterprise space, it was a little bit stronger in the performance enterprise, or business-critical segment as you refer to it, than what we expected. Frankly, we're not entirely sure what drove that. And so -- but a little bit stronger. We -- our share was a little bit off. And so -- but that's not reflective of long-term performance. Capacity enterprise was about where we called it. So generally, not too far off.", "Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And how about the competitive landscape, obviously, you said the share was a bit off, but do you see any major change in terms of the competitive landscape, particularly heading into fourth quarter?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "I wouldn't call anything out. I think it continues to be as competitive as it's been in the past. But I don't think that there's anything particularly unusual right now.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray.", "Andrew J. Nowinski - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "With regard to notebook units, it looks like they were down about 11.5% year-on-year, which was a bit more than we are expecting, I guess. Can you provide any color on what dynamics are impacting that segment?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, like I said in my prepared remarks, there is -- there's always -- we're always looking at the inventory at the OEMs as well and notebook drive shipments will not always coincide with PC systems shipments that leads us to the conclusion that both for us and for the market that the inventories at the OEMs are very, very reasonable.", "Andrew J. Nowinski - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Any color you can provide in terms of what to expect in the December quarter or perhaps the full year?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, we expect for the December quarter as we said a knowable [ph] TAM that's flat. We'll see client flattish with the enterprise flat to slightly up. Our branded products seasonally go up a bit into the December quarter, and then CE will ease off a little bit as the gaming systems that are being built, already use a little bit.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "So just to add a little bit to that, I mean, there's been a fair amount of commentary, I guess, I'll call it that, in terms of what's happening in the notebook space. We are seeing some sign of -- or hearing of some signs may be the better way of characterizing it, of a little bit of a pickup in terms of commercial notebook market. There is still cautious stance or position on the consumer side, particularly as we enter the holiday period. Those are kind of offsetting themselves right now in terms of dynamics because we're still seeing a year-on-year decline in terms of PC shipments, particularly in the notebook space. I think it's a little bit too early from our perspective to call this a -- I'll call it turnaround in terms of what's happening in the commercial space. I mean, there's some data points out there. We'll have to see how sustainable that is. And so we're taking a relatively cautious view until we begin to see a little bit more sustainable pickup in terms of what's happening in the notebook space. But there are some very moderate signs of some encouraging points of -- and we just have to see how sustainable that is and how prolonged that might happen to be.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RNC capital markets.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Two questions for me. One, maybe you could just talk about the inventory build-up was up about 5%, sequentially. It seems like everything was on the raw material side, I'm assuming it has to do somewhat with the acquisition, but maybe you talk about what is organic versus due to stack mostly?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, several -- it's mostly on the raw material side. It's really staging for quarter -- December quarter is usually very, very linear, making sure that we can have the supply line into the customers be very steady. There's a little bit of an impact from the acquisitions as you can imagine. We're also investing actively in FGI. We're using ocean shipments where we can. And again, we're making sure that we're monitoring the demand signals very well so that we have the unit positioned in the just-in-time warehouses where we need them. So we watch the inventory turns very carefully, invest them carefully while watching the overall free cash flow.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Got it. And then if I could just follow up on the gross margin line, it was impressive, it was up 70, 80 basis points versus expectation despite the mix being severely negative but consumer up significantly. So maybe could you; a, talk about what drove that, and then as you get to December, I suspect the mix is getting better for you given the enterprise should ramp up. So why don't you expect the gross margin improvement into the December quarter given my assumption is mix is going to be better?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, first of all, I mean, we have managed the business to have acceptable gross margins in all the businesses that we serve. In the September quarter, we came in at a TAM that was at the upper end of what we guided to, so we shipped a bit more volume that helped free, in [ph] general, with the cost and the teams have done good work on general cost improvements. And the price declines in the quarter were a little bit lower than we had originally modeled. So it didn't come from one particular cost element or price element. It was like a combination of a few things. And then again going into the December quarter, yes, we have chips branded as up a little bit, CE is down a little bit. That's why we're saying the gross margin is flattish as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rob Cihra with Evercore.", "Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Two questions, if I could. One on cash, just the -- so you said, Wolfgang, with $1.4 billion onshore, I guess, just if you look out over the next -- I mean, couple of years, do you see U.S. cash being a limiter to capital allocation plans? And if it was, would you just simply look at raising more debt or repatriating because I'm thinking your offshore cash could be pretty big. Just sort of wondering how you would approach that, and then I have a follow-up if that's okay, unrelated.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "That's a good question. There's several paths to the solution, and we believe with a couple of years runway just from free cash flow that we create in the U.S., plus the opportunity to pay down our current debt and take it on, onshore. If you recall we designed it that way when we made the HGST acquisition. So we have that flexibility in the credit facility. Our leverage ratio with that is at a very modest level. So we have significant incremental debt capacity. And we believe, depending on what we do on the strategic front with our capital allocation strategy that, that will get us through the next couple of years. And then we'll have to see what happens in Washington and -- because this is not a situation that we're in by ourself. It's like 1.6 trillion of U.S. profit trucked offshore. And either there is a change there, or in perpetuity it will be someone repatriating cash and having a tax impact on that.", "Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay, it makes sense. And if I could ask an unrelated follow-up, the -- just the strength you've been seeing in enterprise demand especially in the capacity side, do you see that being driven? I mean is that traditional OEM selling into traditional enterprise, or is that sort of cloud type data centers driving the upside? I mean, do you get a sense of -- I'm assuming the latter is certainly helping, but I mean how much is it helping, I guess?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Rob, it's a little bit of both but certainly the hyperscale guys build out, from a cloud infrastructure standpoint helps a lot with them.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Just as a follow-up to the last question, will it be possible to give us some idea on these hyperscale landscape cloud properties? How big is the revenue stream from them, maybe as opposed to digital [ph] to enterprise revenue, to total revenue?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "At present, we don't provide that information.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and then if I look at your Enterprise SSD revenues, which you just reported this quarter, the quarter-over-quarter sequentially Enterprise SSD revenue is kind of flattish in spite that you have like 3 weeks of stack revenues in NAND [ph], so just kind of wanted to understand that.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes, one of the things that we have been seeing in the NAND demand market is some constraints from a supply perspective. We're beginning to see that sort of free up a little bit. And also with the additional acquisitions, I think that we'll see going into the future a more robust quarter-on-quarter growth rate.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I wanted to follow up on linearity, Steve or Wolfgang, you mentioned it was very good. What's behind that? And is that something that we should expect to continue?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "It's really kind of, fundamentally, the way that we run our business. We really place a lot of importance on cash generation and also managing our build and our inventory levels very closely to the way that our customers pull on product. And also not unnaturally, I'll call it stuffing things in at the end of the quarter. And so it's been something of an -- I can go back to my days at Western Digital back pre 2007, and it was a discipline that existed within Western Digital then. And it's a discipline that we built over time within HGST. And so it's just part of the way that we do business, and I would certainly hope that you'll continue to see the benefits of that from a financial performance perspective.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And as a follow-up, I wanted to try one on the hyperscale cloud buyers. I recognize you can't use names, but any color you can provide on your level of R&D engagement with this community -- visibility you might have? Just wanted to try to understand the depth of the relationship here as -- in general.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes, I'm trying to think how to dimension that question. I mean, we enjoy very strong relationships with a number of different customers, including many of the hyperscale guys. And we see the benefits of that in our financial results. So I don't know if I can comment beyond that. I apologize for not being able to go deeper, but that's kind of where we're at.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I wanted to dig a little bit into your expectations for the margins for the SSD business as we go forward. I know you said that you'd expect those businesses to be accretive, and I think you said early 2015. What type of margins would you expect those to be in line with, Western Digital's corporate margins, or do you think they'll be higher than that as we move into fiscal '15?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, first of all, we're managing our business based on ROIC. So the margins by business line greatly depend on what CapEx, and what we're putting into a business. But we believe, based on the roadmap that we have outlined now, that we have all the assets of sTec, Virident and VeloBit that we'll get to a gross margin profile that's around the current corporate profile.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "I think the other thing to add is that as we have added capability in terms of our Enterprise SSD products, it also is allowing us to wrap enhanced value around the devices that we're providing. And we refer to that as intelligent devices and that sort of thing and there will be a software component. Those clearly will carry higher gross margins than what our overall corporate average. Now how that moves the needle in terms of our overall gross margin profile I think will depend upon how our growth plays out and how the market also plays out.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And now that you've done a number of acquisitions in the SSD space, do you feel like you have all the tools that you need to compete there, or do you think there are pieces that are missing?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Well, we're going to continue to evaluate that. But I think that right now, we feel pretty comfortable with where we're at.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research.", "Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC", "Just 2 questions for me. First of all, in the context of wishing Wolfgang good luck, is there any update on the CFO search? And secondly, Steve, just some of your preamble regarding new products, I was curious on the helium drive and the ultraportable products, are you saying that you're shipping in this quarter or can you just clarify timing for commercial revenues?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Sure, in terms of the CFO update, our CFO search, no update -- search is continuing. And so that's where we're at with that. And then on the new product front, we will be realizing revenue this quarter related to the 7-disk helium product. And we are currently shipping and realizing revenue, of course, on our 5-millimeter, 7-millimeter products, as well as hybrid versions.", "Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC", "Okay, and any I don't know, just pushing it a little bit but is there any comment in terms of how that is ramping or what type of products you are having the most success with on the mobile side?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Well Peter, if you'll recall, when we talked about -- and I'll talk about the hybrid product, that was really -- we were envisioning that more of a 2014 story. So at present, the volumes and the revenue are not that significant, but that's consistent more or less with what we were expecting.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montr\u00e9al.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I was hoping you could give us an update on, a, the timing; and b, the range of scenarios or outcomes as it relates to your discussions with MOFCOM. And then I have a follow-up, please.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "The timing and what else did you --", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "The potential range of outcomes and what I mean by that is there are different scenarios on the potential size or magnitude of release?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Sure, so the timing is that we have the opportunity to remind everybody 2 years after the closing of the transaction. So coming up here in March in 2014, we have the opportunity to -- I'll call it reapply to MOFCOM to have them reconsider the whole separate arrangement that we have. At this point, we -- it's too early to speculate. And it's also too early to speculate in terms of the range of outcomes. And not to sound facetious, but your guess is as good as mine in terms of what that might look like. That being said, we are encouraged in terms of our ongoing relationship with MOFCOM in terms of our compliance and also beginning discussions in terms of the reapplication process.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, so then my follow-up is seasonality for the March quarter, I think with a flat kind of TAM in December, you're -- I think the PC industry has been experiencing less of a seasonal bump in December quarter. I think that there also might be some opportunities to have less of a seasonal down in the March quarter, given where the drives are ending up or the PCs are ending up more in Asia with Chinese New Year and whatnot, but I just wanted to see if you wanted to provide us with some initial thoughts at least on how you're approaching seasonality in the March quarter off of that TAM in December.", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "I'll probably start it off with just how historically the TAM behaved. What we do know is that our branded business is declining a little bit. We have still a strong January and February, but then it's quarter-over-quarter a little bit down. Also, the CE business is quarter-over-quarter down a little bit, again mostly related to the gaming build. In terms of enterprise, we see that market steadily growing. And then the PC business is the one to watch. Historically, it is flat to slightly down going into the March quarter. But again Steve mentioned that there are some signs of a commercial pickup. We just got to watch that very, very carefully and then just do what we always do, react to the downside or to the upside.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe Wittine with Longbow Research.", "Joseph Wittine - Longbow Research LLC", "Any commentary you can provide or any numbers rather on like-for-like ASP declines, or if no specific numbers, at least talk about which subsegments saw lesser like-for-like declines in your expectations in which you may have seen more?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Well, I think the only piece that's useful here is like-for-like price decline was less than the like-for-like cost decline, and therefore, our gross margin increased. So we didn't see anything extraordinary in any of the markets as we drove past down we ship that was how [ph] customers but there wasn't anything extraordinary in anything.", "Joseph Wittine - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. And then on OpEx, I understand you're not guiding for the synergies you're going to have from the deals, but can you confirm that from where we sit today that the December quarter will likely be your near-term peak from a dollar basis?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, that's the intent. I mean, we're not going to shut down an investment or make a hasty decision if we're not clear on the roadmap but that's the intent like we outlined on the Virident announcement call.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Moscowitz with JPMC.", "Mark A. Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I just want to fall back on the CapEx topic. Steve, what's your view at some point, do you have to start spending more in CapEx just for next-generation technologies and could that provide any sort of incremental lift to CapEx or has it kind of already streamlined into the model just given your continuous investments in technology?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "We're investing today in next-generation technology, so I think it's kind of embedded in the numbers that we're seeing already. There may be some investments that come that may -- I mean, it's nominal in terms of the impact, in terms of certainly our CapEx range, and then maybe some big piece of equipment we have to do a particular quarter or whatever. But we are not delaying anything in terms of new capital investments from a technology perspective to drive our free cash flow generation unnaturally in the short term.", "Mark A. Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, so there's nothing on the horizon that could surprise us 6 to 9 months out?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "No, not anything that I have visibility on right now.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Technology Insights Research.", "Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC", "I'd like to also talk about CapEx here. As a percent of revenue, it was around 4% for your second quarter in a row, which is below your target model of 5% to 7%. So are we looking at a new level of CapEx? And if so, why is that? And then also can you talk a little bit longer-term about in the context of potentially a flattish unit growth environment, but ahead in planner [ph] growth, how would that also affect your CapEx rate?", "Wolfgang U. Nickl", "Yes, it's like, like Steve said, really, I mean, there's always different elements of CapEx in our model, and right now, we just don't need to spend on capacity. And we're spending on things like tool upgrades for new aerial density, we're spending on technology, we're spending on solidifying our supply chain, for instance, we now have 2 slide effects on the WD side. There's no reason to update our CapEx model right now and the final outcome for the fiscal year will really depend on what our view is at the tail end of the fiscal year in regards to the demand. In terms of head and media [ph] account, I do think that both of our subs -- the situation where the demand for gigabytes will outstrip what the technology can deliver on aerial density growth. So naturally, the head and media [ph] count will likely go up over the years, so that will first improve the utilization of our current assets and then at one point in time, drives us to do some incremental investments in capacity.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "But right now in terms of our component utilization in terms of from a capacity perspective, that's probably the area where we are the most underutilized. Part of that has to do with the hold separate situation. In other words, there's certain degree of mismatches between the 2 units. And so we're actually pretty comfortable, as a general statement, with where we're at and if component counts go up, and then depending upon what happens in terms of the hold separate situation, we think we'd be able to optimize our component utilization without necessarily adding loss of capital.", "Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC", "So at the end of the day, is there room to potentially move below the target model if demand does not tick up on a year-to-date [ph] basis?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "I think that's something that we have to continue to evaluate, but I think it's a little bit too early to make that call.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Eric Sterling with Barclays.", "Eric Sterling - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I was just wondering, how far out would you say, call it, half a year, 1 year until we can maybe get OpEx closer towards the long-term operating model?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "It's going to depend upon -- we've said in the past that in order to get into the 10% to 12% range of operating expense, it would require us to be able to realize synergies as it relates to the combination of WD and HGST. And so as long as the hold separate situation persists in the current form, we'll continue to operate at a higher level of OpEx than what our target range is.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe Yoo with Citigroup.", "Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Guidance if I could. As you know, Nidec and LSI both guided to...", "Unknown Executive", "Joe could you start over -- you cut off at the beginning?", "Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I mean, just wanted to get some clarification on the TAM guidance. As you know, Nidec and LSI, your suppliers both guided to a TAM closer to $135 million for the December quarter. And historically, obviously, WD has been more conservative on the TAM guidance versus others. So could you help us understand the discrepancy a little?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "I'm not sure if I can help you with that, because I don't know the basis for Nidec or LSI. But undoubtedly, my guess is it has something to do with their unique view and they're also one step removed from a supply chain perspective. So it may be something to do with an inventory situation or what-have-you that they're saying. So I don't -- I'm not sure I can clarify that. But we carefully evaluate where we think the TAM's going to turn out. And I may say this and end up being wrong, but I think that we've done a pretty good job historically calling the market.", "Joe Yoo - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, and my follow-up is maybe if you could provide some color on the adoption of hybrids among OEMs. Are you expecting any meaningful volume as you head into year end?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "I commented on that earlier in terms of we really think it's, for us, it's more of a 2014 story.", "In closing, I want to thank all employees for their dedication and outstanding performance in Q1, and our customers and our suppliers for their support. And on behalf of the Board of Directors and all of our employees, I want to thank Wolfgang very much for his outstanding contributions and service to the company and wish him the very best in his new venture, which he begins in early December.

Today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Jay Iyer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Danielle, and good afternoon, everyone. With me on the call are Sanjay Mehrotra, President and CEO of SanDisk; and Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President of Administration and CFO. In a moment, we will hear remarks from both of them followed by Q&A.

We are also planning for our 2014 Investor Day meeting for May 7, 2014. Please mark your calendars.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Sanjay.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report outstanding fourth quarter and fiscal 2013 results today. We achieved record fourth quarter and full year revenues and record fourth quarter and full year revenue non-GAAP earnings.", "Our business generated record operating and free cash flows for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2013. Consistent with our articulated strategy, solid execution through the year drove a higher mix of SSD and embedded revenues and we strengthened our position in both the client and enterprise SSD markets.", "Our 2013 retail revenue has a new annual record with our retail products achieving substantial share gains in key markets globally. We also initiated a comprehensive capital return program demonstrating our confidence in the future of our business. The powerful secular trends for NAND flash adoption among consumers and enterprises combined with our broadening portfolio of solutions and consistent execution translated into outstanding financial results.", "Moving to details of our business results, our fourth quarter client and enterprise SSD sales increased sequentially to account for 21% of total revenue. Our enterprise SSDs set a new revenue record in the fourth quarter with strong customer adoption of our lightning-fast drive as well as a full quarter of enterprise SSD revenue from our SMART Storage Systems acquisition. Business momentum for the SMART Storage Systems based solution is rising with SATA and fast SSDs achieving several new design wins and many others in the pipeline at traditional storage and server OEMs and at hyper scale accounts.", "Earlier this week, we announced that our UltraDIMM has garnered its first customer acceptance at a Tier 1 storage and server OEM. The UltraDIMM which is an enterprise SSD connected to the server memory bus via DIMM slot is a solution that dramatically improves business application response times. This new product which comes from our SMART Storage Systems acquisition is being implemented in the OEM\u2019s server platforms. We are pleased to see increasing customer interest for this in oriented of high performance, low latency solution. We expect the UltraDIMM revenue ramp to begin later in 2014.", "To wrap-up my comments on enterprise SSDs, this young market is evolving along multiple dimensions each with a different set of products performance requirements and varying implementation schemes of flash depending on the customer type, such as storage and server OEM, hyper scale and others. While the resulting business dynamics vary in terms of products requirements pricing and support, the strength of our vertical integration allows us to address these diverse enterprise opportunities.", "We feel very good about our position in this market and we expect enterprise storage solutions to be the fastest growing product for us in 2014. Furthermore, we expect our broadening engagement with hyper scale customers to begin bearing fruit in 2014 with meaningful revenue contributions starting later in the year.", "In client SSDs, the opportunities for our solutions continue to grow, and we believe we gained substantial share during 2013 with exceptionally strong year-over-year annual revenue growth. The ongoing shift in consumer preference for high performance, slim form factor, long batter life and instant-on capability continues to drive higher attach rates of our solid state storage solutions in notebook PCs and in ultrathin devices.", "In addition, growing ranks of Fortune 500 companies are experiencing the benefits of the enterprise-wide deployments of SSD-based PCs, both in terms of increased device performance and in extension of PC lifecycles. We completed our own enterprise-wide deployment of our SSDs in more than 4,500 notebook PCs in 2013, and we are realizing performance and productivity improvements and a deduction in IT-related costs for repair and recovering lost user data.", "We see these benefits extending to other enterprises and we are working with our OEM customers to increase penetration of our client SSDs in their corporate PC platform offering. I am extremely pleased with our execution in growing our SSD revenues, and we continue to target achieving 25% of our 2014 revenue from enterprise and end-client SSDs.", "In mobile our expanded portfolio of embedded solutions, which include our discrete iNAND, iNAND MCP and custom solutions drove significant growth for us across 2013. In particular, our China market initiative has strengthened our position with the entry in mid-range OEMs, as well as with the emerging companies who are developing premium solutions for both the domestic, China and international markets. We are making good progress in developing our next generation high performance iNAND products, and we expect these to be an important contributor to growth in our embedded revenue in 2014.", "In retail, in the fourth quarter, we saw strength in sales of USB flash drive and a rich mix of high performance mobile cards. I am also pleased to note that SanDisk\u2019s product quality, reliability and brand recognition as well as our track-record of meeting customer specifications and product supply requirements have helped us achieve sole supplier status at a leading U.S. retailer for the imaging category. Additionally, we have been selected as one of the top-five suppliers out of more than 6,000 via global retail chain in the general merchandize category.", "SanDisk\u2019s vertical integration and broad product portfolio along with our focus and operational excellence and customer centricity have been key enablers of these achievements and we are extremely proud of them. With our market leadership we expect 2014 to be another solid year for our retail products.", "In memory technology, our 1Y nanometer technology achieved cost crossover with 19 nanometer in the fourth quarter with big production output exceeding 15% for the quarter. During 2014 we also plan to introduce some X3 based embedded products. We are also making very good progress in developing the 1Z node and we are on-track for starting the production transition to this node towards the end of 2014.", "From a wafer fab perspective, the shell for phase two of Fab 5 is on-track to be completed in mid-2014. And as we have previously explained the new clean room space will be primarily used to support 1Y and 1Z technology transition in Fab 3, Fab 4 and phase one of Fab 5. We also plan to use some portion of the new clean room space for pilot production of our 3D NAND in the latter part of 2015. Our expectation for the production ramp of 3D NAND technology in 2016 remains unchanged.", "In terms of supply growth, we continue to estimate the industry bit growth in 2014 to be approximately 40% the same as our estimate of the 2013 industry bit growth. SanDisk\u2019s supply bit growth in 2013 was 18% and we estimate our 2014 supply bit growth range to be between 25% and 35% consistent with earlier projections. We remain focused on our strategy of our revenue share outperforming our bit share and we believe we are executing well to this strategy. For the year we continue to expect overall healthy industry fundamentals.", "As we look to the future, the rapid proliferation of evermore powerful, smart, connected, consumer and industrial devices will combine to form a much talked about Internet of things. Ultimately, these ubiquitous devices will drive explosive growth in data integration, cloud computing and big data analytics, each of which will have their own requirements for their sponsors and reliable flash solutions.", "SanDisk continues a broad focus in mobile computing solutions including, low power small footprint embedded solutions for miniaturized consumer computing devices, as well as in high performance, high reliability SSDs that can be deployed in all tiers of the datacenter leading to a continued differentiation of our portfolio.", "We are engaged with key players in this eco-system and we\u2019re excited about the growing value proposition of flash to deliver the best storage solution which will enable these computing trends to realize their full potential. To conclude 2013 was a stellar year for the Company as we executed well on our strategy to grow our mix of high value solutions.", "Looking forward to 2014, we believe the secular demand drivers for NAND flash remain healthy and we\u2019re energized to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead of us. I would like to thank our employees for all their hard work in 2013 and our investors for their ongoing support.", "With that I will turn the call over to Judy for her financial review and outlook.", "Judy Bruner", "Thank you, Sanjay. By all measures we delivered outstanding results for Q4 and the full year. We are proud to have produced 22% 2013 revenue growth with 22% gigabyte growth and zero change in our average selling price per gigabyte. By increasing our mix of high value solutions while maintaining disciplined capacity management we were able to achieve substantial revenue growth with modest bit supply growth and this was a key factor in our record free cash flow.", "Our fourth quarter revenue of 1.73 billion grew 12% year-over-year and was comprised of gigabyte growth of 13% and price decline of 2%. On a sequential basis our gigabyte growth was 12% and our price decline was 6%. The sequential price decline in Q4 reflected in part a seasonally higher mix of retail sales which carry a lower average price per gigabyte.", "Our fourth quarter revenue mix by channel was 62% commercial and 38% retail reflecting a sequential increase in retail mix of three percentage points. Our fourth quarter retail revenue grew 16% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. The year-over-year retail growth was driven by mobile cards, USBs and SSDs. While sequentially we also benefited from seasonal growth in imaging cards. For the full year we gained significant global retail share enabling our retail revenue to grow at nearly the same rate as our commercial revenue and maintain a 2013 retail mix of 37% the same as in 2012.", "Our fourth quarter commercial revenue grew 1% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. The year-over-year commercial growth was driven by a strong increase in SSD revenue, both client and enterprise partially offset by a decline in mobile revenue. Looking at the mobile revenue from the commercial channel, card sales were down year-over-year due to continued OEM de-bundling and our reduced supply to white label channels. While our sales of mobile cards through the commercial channel were down on a year-over-year basis, we more than made up for this in sales of aftermarket retail mobile cards. And our total Q4 mobile card revenue was up quite nicely year-over-year.", "Our fourth quarter mobile embedded revenue was down year-over-year due to lower sales of custom embedded solutions. Within our embedded sales our iNAND and MCP iNAND revenue was up year-over-year, driven by growing demand for entry level and mid-tier mobile devices. Sanjay has discussed our SSD revenue, so I will just point out that SSDs now account for nearly a third of our commercial sales and adding in our retail SSDs, we\u2019re thrilled that SSDs achieved a 21% mix of our total Q4 revenue.", "Looking across all channels within our 2013 revenue of 6.17 billion, our embedded revenue grew 37%, removable product revenue declined 2% and SSD revenue grew 170%.", "Turning to gross margin, our non-GAAP gross margin of 50.9% was 80 basis points better than our Q3 gross margin and 200 basis points above the midpoint of our previous guidance. There were three primary factors contributing to the stronger than expected gross margin in Q4; first an increased mix of sales utilizing X3 memory; two, receipt of the settlement related to a fab power outage in 2010 ; and three, an increase in license and royalty revenue in Q4, in part from one-time payments.", "Our blended cost per gigabyte declined 6% sequentially, the same as price decline with the cost improvement coming primarily from three areas; one, a yen rate in cost of sales of 97 compared to 93 in the third quarter; two, a higher mix of X3 based sales; and three, an increase in fully depreciated fab tools. For the full year 2013, our cost per gigabyte improvement was 20% compared to zero change in our ASP per gigabyte.", "Our Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses increased 41 million sequentially to 323 million, slightly higher than our previous forecast of 310 million to 320 million. The sequential increase included certain one-time expenses in R&D of 11 million, seasonal expenses of approximately 6 million and higher bonus expense of 5 million related to our strong 2013 results. The remaining sequential increase relates to a full quarter versus partial quarter of SMART Storage Systems\u2019 expenses, and increased headcount and engineering material.", "Our non-GAAP operating expenses for the full year were 18.2% of revenue within our target model of 17% to 19%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was an outstanding 32% for Q4 and 29% for the full year and we set quarterly and annual records for operating income dollars on both a non-GAAP and GAAP basis.", "Our diluted share count continued to come down benefiting from a full quarter of our significant Q3 share repurchases, as well as additional share repurchases made in Q4 in conjunction with our convertible offering.", "Turning to cash flow, our Q4 cash flow from operations was a record 617 million bringing the full year to a record 1.86 billion. We used 41 million of cash during the quarter for capital investments inclusive of the fab joint ventures bringing free cash flow to 576 million for Q4 and 1.7 billion for the full year. Our 2013 free cash flow was 28% of revenue and over $7 per share.", "For 2013, our total fab and non-fab capital investments were 859 million and our total cash investment was 138 million, with the remainder of the investment funded by the joint ventures. Flash ventures did not take out any new equipment leases during 2013, and our off balance sheet fab lease guarantees are now less than 500 million. For 2013 we spent nearly 1.6 billion on share repurchases and 100 million on our quarterly dividend which we instituted in the third quarter. In total our 2013 return of cash to shareholders was 98% of free cash flow.", "I will now turn to forward-looking commentary for Q1 and 2014. Let me start with a few comments on supply and pricing, our expected growth in bit supply from the fabs remains consistent with our prior estimates of 25% to 35%. We expect to be able to grow our revenue bits in the upper half of that range as we tighten our inventory levels. For 2014 we expect a healthy balance between industry demand and supply resulting in a modest level of price decline albeit more than what the industry experienced in 2013.", "For the first quarter, we expect to experience typical seasonality resulting in lower sequential revenue. Our first quarter revenue estimate is 1.45 billion to 1.525 billion and our full year estimate is 6.4 billion to 6.8 billion.", "Turning to gross margins, we expect our 2014 cost reduction to be less than the 20% generated in 2013, likely towards the low-end of the 15% to 25% range previously described. Our primary cost reduction will come from the 1Y transition with an expected positive impact from the yen and a dampening of the cost reduction metric from our continued mix shift towards products which carry higher non-flash content. In addition our gross margin expectations anticipates that a portion of our SMART Storage based sales will use non-captive memory for the majority of the year given various customer qualification schedules.", "Relative to the yen, the rate in our Q1 cost of sales is expected to be approximately 99 based on average purchases during Q4. We also placed hedges in Q4 for approximately one-third of our remaining expected 2014 yen requirements at a rate of approximately 99. We currently plan to purchase the remainder of the yen over the course of the year at market rate.", "Our non-GAAP gross margin estimate for the first quarter is 47% to 49% which reflects a lower revenue level and a lower mix of high margin retail sales. For the full year 2014, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be similar to our full year 2013 results with a non-GAAP gross margin range of 45% to 48%. We expect expenses for 2014 to be in the upper part of our 17% to 19% target range as we continue to invest and expand in our SSD product offerings and building our enterprise go-to-market and support capabilities.", "For the full year, we forecast non-GAAP operating expenses of 1.225 billion to 1.25 billion with the first quarter being 300 million to 310 million. We expect our fab capital investments to increase in 2014 driven primarily by the increased capital intensity of the 1Y node which we have previously described, as well as investment in 3D NAND development tools in the fab joint ventures. We expect additions to our wafer capacity inclusive of productivity improvements to be 5% or less.", "Our non-fab capital investments are also expected to increase in 2014 and include planned expansion of our assembly and test capacity footprint, as well as equipment and facilities for R&D groups in various parts of the world. Our total capital investment for 2014 is expected to be between 1.5 billion and 1.7 billion with cash requirements being approximately half of this amount. Given the increase in capital spending, we expect a reduced level of free cash flow in 2014 relative to 2013. And we plan to continue our return of capital strategy including share repurchase at approximately 70% of our free cash flow.", "Another factor impacting our share count will be that our stock price is now above the upper strike of the call spread placed on our 2017 convertible debt security. The options within this call spread effectively hedge the dilution from the underlying convertible security and the impact of the options is included in our non-GAAP share count. The warrants within the call spread determine the effective strike price of the convertible debt and since the warrants are now in the money we expect to incur non-GAAP share count dilution from the warrants in Q1 in 2014.", "Taking into account dilution from the warrants new equity issuances to employees and offsetting share repurchase, our best estimate is that our 2014 non-GAAP diluted share count will be approximately flat to the 229 million shares in Q4.", "Finally our non-GAAP tax rate for 2014 is forecasted at 31.5%, slightly higher than in 2014 due to the expiration of the U.S. R&D tax credit. In summary, we delivered outstanding 2013 results with 22% revenue growth, 29% non-GAAP operating margin and $1.7 billion of free cash flow and we returned 98% of that free cash flow to our shareholders.", "As we manage our business for 2014 and beyond, our priorities remain focused on further strengthening and broadening our product portfolio, continued disciplined capacity management and investment in future technologies and operational capabilities. We believe this will enable us to deliver another strong year in 2014 with solid revenue growth and excellent operating margins.", "We are now happy to answer your questions.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Judy, thank you, Sanjay. Danielle if you can open the floor for questions. We will do the Q&A session until 3 O\u2019clock.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Absolutely. (Operator Instructions) We will go first to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.", "Farhan Ahmed - Credit Suisse", "Hi, this is Farhan Ahmed asking a question on behalf of John. My first question is regarding the X3 products that you talked about in the embedded market. Can you talk about the embedded and client SSD margins today and if you introduce 60, how should that effect the margins and also you talked about revenue increasing, your bit growth this year but if you increase the mix of X3 products, wouldn\u2019t that lead to faster bit growth for you? ", "Judy Bruner", "This is Judy, let me take the question. Let me start with, you were asking about embedded and client margins and how X3 would impact that. Let me start with the margins within our business and then talk about X3. So if you think about our gross margins, obviously some gross margins tend to be below the corporate average and some growth margins tend to be above the corporate average.", "Embedded mobile products and client SSD products tend to have gross margins that are somewhat below the corporate average. Enterprise SSD products and retail products tend to have gross margins that are definitely above the corporate average. As you understand everything, can\u2019t be above the corporate average. ", "As we introduce X3 memory into certain products, like embedded mobile products, we believe that will tend to improve the gross margins in that category. And that\u2019s our expectation for several of the new products that we expect to be introducing in the coming year.", "Then you asked about X3 mix in terms of bit growth and our estimate of 25% to 35% supply bit growth for 2014 includes our expectation for technology transitions and our expectation for wafer mix in terms of X2 wafers and X3 wafers. So, that\u2019s already built into our expectation for supply bit growth and revenue bit growth and the reason we think our revenue bit growth can be in the upper half of the range of supply bit growth is that we think we can tighten our inventory levels, our inventory weeks of supply somewhat in 2014. ", "Farhan Ahmed - Credit Suisse", "And then touching on to the retail business, you mentioned that it has very good gross margins. And I just wanted to understand in terms of the retail business, how much of the retail businesses is in emerging markets and how much of it is basically tied to the lower mid end Smartphones? If you can just talk about that, that would be really helpful. ", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "In terms of units, more than half our units sold are in the emerging markets and as we have said before, we are doing very well in the emerging markets. SanDisk brand frankly across the globe is doing very well. And mobile cards in retail certainly are growing opportunity as non iOS phones, they all have pretty much card slots in them and aftermarket card sales for mobile phones continues to do very well for us and in fact growing category and again leveraging SanDisk broad distribution, more than a quarter billion store fronts and SanDisk recognition as a trusted brand really is, defiantly continuing to help us capture bulk of the opportunity in mobile cards in the retail markets.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Farhan. In interest of time can I ask the callers to limit themselves to one question a brief follow up? Danielle, the next question please. ", "Operator", "Will come from Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets. ", "Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets", "Great, thanks for taking my question guys and congratulations on the strong results. If you could dig in a little bit on the CapEx number, give us a little bit of color on the linearity of when that CapEx will be spent and when you think that supply comes online. And maybe if you could offer some color on how much of that is really being spent for incremental supply, versus continuing to keep your wafer output flat as you node migrate?", "Judy Bruner", "Okay. So, the CapEx estimate for 2014 which was $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, let me just deal with the midpoint of that range for a moment, call it $1.6 billion. Lastly, $1.2 billion of that would be fab related and roughly $400 million of that would be non-fab related.", "And then if we look at the fab portion of that, the $1.2 billion, I believe that the spending, first of all, the bulk of it is related to the 1Y transition. And the 1Y transition, we expect is occurring fairly linearly over the course of 2014. So that would cause the majority of that to the spent fairly linearly over the course of the year. There will also be included in that number some development tools related to 3D NAND. I would guestimate that spending is probably more in the middle of the year, but there will be spending over the course of the year there as well.", "And then wafer capacity, thank you. Wafer capacity, we expect will increase during 2014 by 5% or less and that is inclusive of productivity improvements. We have not made a decision on any new wafer capacity; however, if we do add new wafer capacity, that new wafer capacity plus productivity improvements we expect would add to the wafer capacity, no more than 5%.", "Operator", "And we will hear from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.", "Mehdi Hosseini - SIG", "Sanjay, I want to go back to your announcement from a week or so ago talking about UltraDIMM and IBM becoming one of the customer. Can you help us understand the market opportunities and if there are more than IBMs out there that you\u2019re working with? And you also mentioned earlier that when it comes to SMART scaling and to that extent UltraDIMM products, how much of a non-captive capacity would you need? And is that already dialed into your revenue guidance?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Regarding UltraDIMM exciting, innovative new product category, actually first of its kind in the marketplace and its main application, as you know is regarding ultra-low latency, targeting applications that require ultra-low latency for highest performance of the application. And also the benefit of UltraDIMM is it goes into the DIMMs slots in the servers, into the memory slots. So the capacity can easily be scaled up with full performance being maintained. So that\u2019s yet another significant benefit of it.", "So we think that in very ultra-low latency kind of applications, there will be growing opportunity for UltraDIMM. Keep in mind this is a new product category. New product categories in the industry, in any industry, take a while to evolve.", "We are engaged with qualifications with the leading customer that you mentioned and we\u2019re of course engaged with other customers as well. In terms of the revenue opportunity for this, it is too early to really quantify. I would certainly expect it to be multi 100 millions of opportunity and starting from there and growing in the future. But really this is too early to call out. We are engaged in creating the market opportunity here.", "And your second question regarding the non-captive memory in UltraDIMMs or other smart products, yes I mean expectations of that are baked into our revenue guidance, as well as in our margin guidance. ", "Mehdi Hosseini - SIG", "Okay great and then if I were just to extend from there and a question for Judy, as your revenue mix diversify, it seems to me just taking bits and ASP is not going to fully capture opportunities for you, especially into process SSD scales? And I have asked this question many times, is there any way you could help us to better model and capture these incremental opportunities above and beyond this year in the longer term?", "Judy Bruner", "So you\u2019re right, that increasingly providing those statistics of bit growth and ASP change does not adequately describe our revenue opportunity or the changes in our business model. And in fact we believe that our business results are becoming less and less correlated to the component pricing statistics that you see out there in the marketplace. And I think that\u2019s pretty evident in the results that we reported today.", "And we also believe that this is resulting in our business model becoming more consistent and more resilient. So in terms of us been able to help you model our business, I think we do breakout for you the percentage of our revenue that is coming from the different broad product categories and form factors and we\u2019ll continue to do that and we will look for other metrics that we can help provide you overtime.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll hear from James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs", "Relative to your comments on the transition to 1Y and 1Z, if you\u2019re starting 1Z starting at the end of 2014, does that imply that the 1Y transition will be potentially complete by the end of 2014?", "Judy Bruner", "I believe that the 1Y will account for roughly something like two thirds of our bit output by the end of the year. Of course there will always a tail on 1Y just like there is a tail on 19. But yes, it will be definitely more than half and probably roughly two thirds by the end of the year of our output, bit output.", "James Schneider - Goldman Sachs", "And then as a clarification, you mentioned the vast majority or some portion at least of the phase two of Fab 5 being filled up with equipment needed for process migration and then the initial pilot line for 3D. Can you talk about how much clean room space might be left for potential new capacity adds, now that you\u2019ve decided to do that? But give us a sense of roughly how much clean room space might be left for wafer additions if you do decide to do them at some point?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So the phase two clean room space will be used for technology transitions for 1Y and 1Z in our installed capacity base, primarily 1Z technology transition actually in phase two of the installed capacity of Fab 3, 4 and Fab 5 phase one. Phase two will also be using up some of the clean room space for big 3D NAND related equipment for the pilot lines and some level of production capability of 3D NAND.", "And yes beyond that there will be some space available in phase two, which we have not really made any decision on. And it is too soon to quantify how much space will be left. It will be very much depending upon finalization of the process of record for 1Z technology as well as the process of record for the 3D NAND technology. And of course that space will be available for us for any future technology related, whether transition related aspects or any new potential capacity as well.", "Jay Iyer", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Will from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company.", "Timothy Arcuri - Cowen and Company", "Couple of questions. First on your guidance for the full year, you guided revenue down 7% mid-point and you said that your bit supply growth will be between 25% and 35%. So it seems to imply that pricing is going to go down more than roughly 20%, which seems like a good bit. But then you said that pricing would be down only slightly for the year. And I know that you\u2019re really vectoring differently from the market. But when you talked about ASTB down slightly, were you talking more about the overall market?", "Judy Bruner", "No, I said that we expect overall for 2014 that the industry has a good supply demand balance, a healthy environment. And in a healthy environment we expect that over time industry price decline is probably roughly correlated or similar to industry cost decline. And as a result we expect that industry price decline in 2014 is somewhat more than industry price decline in 2013.", "We expect that we can continue to do better in terms of our overall blended price decline than the industry price decline as we continue to execute on our strategy of moving our portfolio, shifting our portfolio, to higher value added solutions. But there is obviously some expectation of price decline in the industry and in our business model as well.", "Timothy Arcuri - Cowen and Company", "Got it, okay. Thanks for that, and then just a question on CapEx. So the CapEx is doubling with no wafer capacity at year-over-year, which I guess is pretty amazing unto itself. But of the 1.2 billion fab related spending, can you tell us how much of that is related to the development tools for 3D?", "Judy Bruner", "We\u2019re not really breaking that out but definitely the vast majority of the spending is related to the 1Y transition. And actually I will point out that we did actually show a fair amount of detail in our slides at our May 2013 Investor Day to show the increased capital intensity of the 1Y technology relative to the 19 nanometer technology.", "Jay Iyer", "Thanks Tim. Next question please.", "Operator", "Is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.", "Craig Ellis - B. Riley", "Judy, can you go into a little bit more detail on some of the puts and takes with cost reduction this year? And specifically with regards to the headwind that the company has and then I think you talked about [indiscernible] Analyst Day with the higher cost mix as it relates to SSDs. How much of the headwind is that in this year\u2019s cost reduction and how does that evolve over time? Is that an even further mix next year if we see enterprise SSDs grow or is it at a point where it might stabilize is an incremental dynamic year-on-year?", "Judy Bruner", "Okay. So in terms of the puts and takes in 2014 cost improvement, clearly, the biggest improvement will continue to come from the technology transition and in 2014 from 1Y, we have said in the past that the inherent cost reduction capability of 1Y is somewhat less than the cost reduction capability of 19 nanometer, but 1Y will continue to be the biggest driver of cost improvement. We expect to also get cost improvement from the yen rate in our cost of sales in 2014 as we did in 2013. And we would expect to continue to get some benefit from depreciation rolling off from some of our fully depreciated tools, albeit less of that in 2014 than we did in 2013.", "In terms of some of the items that will reduce cost improvement, meaning go the other way, headwind, product mix will continue to operate in that way. That does not mean that it is reducing gross margin, but it does mean that as we move to products that have higher non-flash content like enterprise SSDs, it offsets some of the cost improvement on a cost per gigabyte basis. It also dampens the price reduction that we see in our business model. And then one other item that will dampen cost improvement is the non-captive memory that we expect to use for some of the smart based products for the majority of the year.", "Craig Ellis - B. Riley", "", "The follow up is what\u2019s the assumption on share buyback for calendar \u201814? Is it at 70% free cash flow target or is it a different number?", "Judy Bruner", "", "We\u2019re assuming that we will purchase at 70% of our free cash flow and I will point out that that is the stated program we have talked about for some period of time, that we would spend the greater of what it takes to offset employee equity dilution or 70% of free cash flow and even though we expect our free cash flow to be less in 2014 than it was in 2013 due to the higher CapEx spending, we definitely believe 70% of that free cash flow will still be a larger number than what is required to offset employee equity dilution. That\u2019s why we believe that that share repurchase at 70% of free cash flow can also offset any warrant dilution that we experienced due to the warrants being in the money.", "So we think that we\u2019ll continue to have a very sound program in terms of share repurchase and of course following a year in which we had remarkable cash generation and remarkable return of cash.", "Jay Iyer", "", "Next question please.", "Operator", "", "We\u2019ll hear from Mark Newman with Sanford Bernstein.", "Mark Newman - Sanford Bernstein", "", "I have some questions on the technology process migration and how your 1Y transition is going? So as complexity is increasing, the scaling is slowing, we seem to be carrying close to the end of scaling here, you mentioned several times about less benefit on the 1Y nodes. And clearly some issues from other competitors in this industry. So I just wanted to ask you on how the 1Y is going. From what you said on the call, it seems to be quite smooth. But I just wanted to check about, have you come across any difficulties, increased difficulties, impact on yield or quality, relative at this point of your ramp curve, relative to previous nodes?", "And also related to that, your control expertise, which is also phenomenal and firm, is that becoming significantly more complicated as I expect it is and could you perhaps talk to those issues?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "", "1Y, as we have said before, really doing very well. 1Y yields are ramping up very nicely. 1Y at this point of the technology development and production ramp is actually doing better than our 90 nanometer did in terms of use at similar times. Of course the reliability of 1Y is solid as well. We have been shipping 1Y products since the Q3 timeframe and of course we\u2019re engaged with qualification of 1Y in embedded and SSD platforms and those will be ramping during the course of the year.", "At the end of 2013 for Q4, 15% of our bit output was in 1Y technology note, and as Judy just earlier mentioned that by the end of year we would be expecting to be at a quarterly rate of two-thirds of our output in 1Y. So 1Y will continue to ramp from that 15% level at the end of last year to where two-third of our bit output at the end of the year. 1Y will continue to ramp up gradually during the course of the year.", "Controller expertise, firmware management techniques, understanding the customer applications and making sure that our product solutions are robust to meet the requirements in terms of performance, in terms of handling workload, as well as reliability, these are of course key aspects that our controller helps us manage and again this is the differentiation that SanDisk has in this regard and our experience of prior handling, prior generations of memory as well as experience of handling now six generations of X3 memory is really helping in terms of applying this 1Y technology rapidly across various product platforms. So all in all, really 1Y is doing very well for us and I\u2019m very encouraged by the results, initial results on 1Z technology as well.", "Mark Newman - Sanford Bernstein", "", "Great, and then just one quick follow up on technology. Could you give an update on 3D NAND, how that is going right now, the status and schedule.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "", "3D NAND, we are making good progress there and as we have said before, the schedule for 3D NAND in terms of starting to ramp up volume production is in 2016, pilot line production, sampling capability in second half of 2015. We are on track for that.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Mark, next question please.", "Operator", "", "We\u2019ll hear from Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.", "Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James", "Just a follow on to that question on 3D NAND, what\u2019s your positioning competitively or your approach to 3D NAND versus the competition at this point?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Well, we are not going to get into any technology specifics here of our 3D NAND versus competition, but what I can tell you is that as we have said before, we really believe that as long as you can extend the 2D NAND life, it is in the best interest in terms of ROI and in terms of really applying that technology across a broad range of industry applications, and of course getting full benefit in terms of bit growth, as well as cost aspect.", "So we feel very comfortable with our 1Y and 1Z technology nodes serving us very well in 2014 and 2015 timeframe, and in 2016 as I said, we\u2019ll be ramping up production of our 3D NAND technology but I can\u2019t really give you specifics in terms of comparison for confidentiality reasons.", "Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James", "Okay and then as a follow up, any sense of what bit supply growth for the industry or SanDisk for next year will be?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "It\u2019s really too soon to say anything about next year, but really overall, next year means 2015, I assume you\u2019re talking about, and the bit growth rate, I would not expect it to be any higher than the kind of levels that we are already at on a year-over-year basis, because again as we have talked about before, technology complexity is increasing, technology transitions are giving you less bit growth per wafer, given the increasing CapEx, as well as the looming transition from 2D to 3D. CapEx is also -- I mean there are new capacities not being added, prudent capacity management. So all of this -- it really points to continuing, extended stability for bit growth in the industry I believe in the future as well.", "And keep in mind that 3D technology in terms of its ramp in the industry will go slow, because this technology first has to be proven, reliable and applicable across various segments of the flash and continue to exist, coexist with 3D in the industry for next several years and all that will ultimately add up I believe to extended stability in the industry environment and to moderate bit growth in the future years as well, but can\u2019t really give you specifics about 2015.", "Jay Iyer", "Thanks Hans. Next question please.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll hear from Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee.", "Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee", "Just wondering, when you look at your 1Y, when you look at the three bit 1Y how does that ramp and how\u2019s the mix fab going to the end of the year?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "1Y X3 going very well. In fact we started shipping 1Y X3 products already. As I mentioned before in third quarter, our removable products use 1Y X3. So both 1Y X2 as well as 1Y X3 ramps are going well and as I mentioned in my script, prepared remarks that we will be having embedded solutions with X3 technology during the course of the year as well. And those will be in 1Y.", "Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee", "And on the 1Z, is that 14 nanometer or 12 nanometer if you can give some color there, and on the enterprise side is it mostly today on 24 nanometer and so is there a cost on curve on the enterprise side as you go through 2014?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So your first question, I\u2019m sorry, [indiscernible], 1Z you\u2019re asking for the specifics of 1Z technology node and for competitive reasons we do not disclose that and we\u2019ll provide you more details as we get closer to having that technology ready for production. And regarding 19 nanometer transition for our enterprise storage products, of course that transition is underway and in our guidance for 2014 our estimations for that have all been baked in.", "Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee", "Right, thanks.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "", "Thanks, Vijay. Danielle, we have time for one last question.", "Operator", "", "And that will come from Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities", "", "First question is on the capital intensity, going from 19 to 1Y; it has almost increased 70% to 80%. First of all, you spent less than what you had guided initially in the year for last year. So is it to do with something that adjustment? And then, the question is basically how should we think about capital intensity going to 1Z from 1Y and then going to 3D NAND from pre-NAND?", "Judy Bruner", "", "Okay. So, first of all, you are right that we did spend last in CapEx in 2013 than we had originally expected. I believe I have said $1 billion to $1.1 billion and we ended up spending $859 million. There were a couple of reasons for that. Some of the lower spend was outside of the fabs, meaning non-fab equipment, and some of that spending just from a timing perspective will happen in 2014 relative to 2013. So, that is currently contributing to the higher number of non-fab spending in 2014.", "And then another factor in why the CapEx came in lower in 2013 was actually that some of this was clearly yen based and we benefited somewhat from our original estimate as the yen weakened. And then even within the fab there is timing in terms of some tools getting accepted just after the first of the year versus just right before the first of the year and falling into the 2014 estimate. Okay, then you asked about the capital intensity of 1Y to 1Z and 1Z will be similar, maybe somewhat less than 1Y. It will be more than 19 -- definitely more than 19 but a little bit less than 1Y in terms of capital intensity.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities", "", "Judy, there is a follow-up on the margin guidance. Q1 you have guided midpoint 48 points, but for the year midpoint is 46.5. So given that Q1 is actually seasonally slow quarter, so are you expecting ASP declines in the back half of 2014 then?", "Judy Bruner", "", "There is a lot of different factors in the gross margin guidance for the full year and we have done our best to take all of those into account. Clearly we have looked at our expectation of the pricing environment over the course of the year. We have looked at our product mix and keep in mind as I mentioned earlier in response to another question, we have a variety of different gross margins across our different product categories. And even within each product category there is a wide range of gross margins depending on the product and/or the channel or customer or geography that we are selling to.", "So, we done our best estimate in terms of that annual range of gross margin being 45% to 48%, which I want to point out is really a very strong gross margin range, leading to a very strong operating margin range for the company. And I think in the end, what matters here is can we continue to grow our top line and grow our bottom line dollars over time and we think we can.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "", "Unfortunately that\u2019s all the time we have today. We want to thank everyone for joining us on the call. A reply of today\u2019s call should be available on our website at sandisk.com/ir and thank you and have a good evening.", "Operator", "", "And ladies and gentlemen that will conclude today\u2019s conference.

We serve very large markets, underpinned by strong data growth prospects. It is clear to us, that most of the world's data will be stored on hard drives and enterprise-class solid state drives in tiered architectures, as companies and consumers seek to optimize performance. Strategically, we are well positioned to play a leadership role, by innovating and collaborating with our customers to define the future digital data landscape.", "Total exabytes shipped and average gigabytes per drive continued to grow, reflecting strong customer response to our enterprise and branded products. These are two growing businesses, where we have established leadership position. Continued success in these markets offers us the opportunity to achieve even better financial results over time, as we add more and more value to our solutions.", "As data becomes more strategic in the enterprise, companies are investing differently in IT infrastructure, looking to achieve optimal total cost of ownership. This is resulting in more fragmented solutions, allowing for more customization, and value creation by storage providers. These trends are helping to drive the upward trajectory in our cloud-related revenue.", "Over the last few months, customers have responded positively to two of our newest products, addressing the demand for innovative solutions in the personal, public and private clouds. Specifically, we launched the WD My Cloud, a comprehensive personal cloud solution for users to organize, centralize and secure their digital content, and access it from anywhere in the world. This is an important element of our Connected Life initiative to improve the connectivity of the home.", "We launched our 6-terabyte helium-based sealed drive, which leverages our proprietary technology platform called HelioSeal. Select strategic customers have already qualified the drive, and we are shipping the product.", "We have also seen continued customer preference for our portfolio of enterprise class solid state drives. In the December quarter, our SSD enterprise revenue outpaced the growth rate in the overall SSD enterprise market, as we continue to integrate our recently acquired talent and technology into the HGST-SSD organization.", "We are excited about the year ahead, tempered by the industry's usual seasonality in the first half of the year. We see several potential drivers for a better demand environment, including prospects for an improving global economy, a stabilizing PC market, and ongoing investments in both the traditional and capacity enterprise markets.", "I will now turn the call over to Tim Leyden.", "Timothy Leyden", "Thank you, Steve. Our strong December quarter performance, benefited from solid market demand, favorable channel and business mix, and continuing good execution. The hard drive industry shipped approximately 142 million units during the December quarter, up from the September quarter and the year-ago period, and the TAM came in slightly higher than the guidance we gave on our October call. In our business, we saw strength in gaming, consistent quarter-over-quarter performance in clients and enterprise, and the anticipated seasonal pick-up in branded products.", "Our distribution and retail channel inventory remains lean. Our revenue for the December quarter was $4 billion, including $155 million from enterprise SSDs. While we expect our enterprise SSD revenue growth rate to continue to exceed that of the industry, the upward trajectory in the December quarter was especially strong, given a single source opportunity. Overall, 54% of our revenue came from non-PC applications.", "We shipped a total of 63.1 million hard drives at an average selling price of $60. The quarter-over-quarter increase in overall ASP, was primarily driven by the seasonal uptick in branded products and strength in distribution.", "Our gross margin for the quarter was 28.7%; non-GAAP gross margin was 30.1%, excluding $40 million of amortization expense for acquired intangible assets, as well as $15 million of restructuring charges. We exceeded our implied guidance from non-GAAP gross margin by 30 basis points, primarily due to favorable business mix.", "R&D and SG&A spending totaled $650 million for the December quarter. SG&A included the following items: $12 million of charges related to certain litigation, $11 million of amortization expense for acquired intangible assets, and $6 million of restructuring and other charges. R&D included $5 million of restructuring charges. As a reminder, the previous period included a flood-related insurance recovery of $65 million.", "We accrued interest charges of $13 million in the December quarter, relating to the Seagate arbitration matter. Tax expense for the December quarter was $37 million or 8% of pre-tax income. Our net income for the December quarter totaled $430 million or $1.77 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $532 million, or $2.19 per share.", "Turning to the balance sheet; we generated $727 million in cash from operations and our free cash flow totaled $557 million. Our CapEx for the December quarter totaled $170 million, or 4% of revenue. As part of our capital allocation program, we repurchased 2 million shares for $150 million during the December quarter. We also declared dividend in the amount of $0.30 per share. We exited Q2 with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.7 billion, of which approximately $700 million was in the US.", "I will now provide our guidance for the March quarter. We expect revenue to be seasonally down, and in a range of $3.65 billion to $3.75 billion, reflecting the seasonally lower TAM. Gross margin, approximately at the midpoint of our 27% to 32% model, excluding the amortization of intangibles, reflecting the impact of lower factory utilization due to lower volumes. R&D and SG&A spending of approximately $600 million, excluding the amortization of intangibles; a tax rate of approximately 8% and the share count of approximately 243 million.", "Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.80 and $1.90 for the March quarter, which includes a dilution impact of $0.10 from the sTec and Virident acquisitions. As a reminder, we expect the sTec, VeloBit and Virident acquisitions to be accretive early in calendar year 2015.", "Overall, we are pleased with our continued strong performance. We are enthusiastic about our prospects to play an increasingly strategic role in the evolving storage market.", "Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). And our first quarter comes from Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Hey good afternoon. Can you hear me okay?", "Stephen Milligan", "Yes.", "Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "How would you characterize the compute and enterprise market versus your original expectations in December? And then can you just talk about, in each of those segments, what you think seasonality will look like in the first quarter, and you mentioned potential upticks as the economies improve, when would you expect to see the better seasonality off of the macro recovery? Thanks.", "Stephen Milligan", "Sure Katie. Couple of comments. In terms of the quarter, the past quarter, so calendar Q4; for the most part, it really kind of played out to the way that we expected it. Enterprise really sort of came in, both in terms of the performance enterprise and capacity enterprise, more or less turned out the way that we expected it, where we saw a little bit more strength was the notebook business or 2.5 inch client business was may be a bit stronger than what we expected it to be.", "Also, the gaming market, gaming business was certainly stronger than what we expected. The new gaming consoles appeared to be -- consumers appeared to be responding to them very favorably, and that's encouraging to us, we are glad to see that; and again, I think the branded products business was seasonally stronger. And so really things played out very consistently to our expectation, with a bit more strength in gaming and a bit more strength in the notebook business.", "Now, in terms of how things are going to play out in 2014, a little bit hard to say, frankly. One of the things that we are seeing right now, because we haven't seen it frankly for several years, is we are seeing seasonality return a bit. If you go back in time, we've had various things that impacted seasonality. We have had earthquake in Japan, we have had floods in Thailand, we have had other kinds of situations that have -- may be masked from our perspective, traditional seasonality in our business. So if you look at this quarter, the March quarter, PCs traditionally are down about 10%. So we are looking at a TAM reduction of probably in the 5% to 7%, may be 8% level.", "One of the things that is making things a little bit difficult from a clarity perspective, is that Chinese New Year is a bit earlier this year. So what we are seeing some of our customers do in the PC space is, do a bit of build-ahead in anticipation of the Chinese New Year shutdown, and then we will have to see how demand picks up after that.", "So that's just a bit of color in terms of what we are seeing from a demand environment perspective.", "Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "And then, just as a follow-up, there was margin upside this quarter even without enterprise upside, what would it take to get margins up into the 30% to 32% sustainably? What do you need to see over the next four quarters, for that type of margin upside?", "Stephen Milligan", "To answer that question in kind of a generic way; we are going to have to continue to do, which is really what -- we are really trying to do all the time, is continue to add more value from a customer perspective; and we do think that as we do that, there is an opportunity for us to see our margins creep up a bit. I mean, that's really what we have been doing. Obviously we are going to continue to do the things that historically we have done, which I will call it the normal blocking and tackling, managing our mix, managing our costs effectively, and so -- but really, what we've got to do, is continue to add more value from a product perspective.", "The other thing is, is that specifically as it relates to our enterprise SSD business and some of the acquisitions that we made there, we need to continue to ramp those, which is coming along nicely, and as we do that, and as we see that become a more material part of our business, that should contribute favorably to our gross margin structure going forward.", "Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham. Your line is open.", "Richard Kugele - Needham and Company", "Thank you. Good afternoon. Just a few questions for me. I guess first, let's talk about the SSD side a little bit. Do you see the operating structure of the now combined entity appropriately sized and the accretion that's at early calendar 2015 is driven by just revenue growth, or do you have some operational changes that you are trying to make as well? Just trying to understand the puts and takes that gets you from here, with $0.10 dilution to the accretion?", "Stephen Milligan", "Rich, I think there is a couple of different factors. I mean, one, we are still in the process of making sure that we optimize the organization, both from a pure headcount perspective, as well as making sure that we have got the right mix of employees, and so that process is ongoing, and we continue to do that, but the main thing that we need to do in order to realize that accretion in 2015, is continue to ramp our revenue appropriately, with the appropriate product set.", "Richard Kugele - Needham and Company", "Okay. Then secondly, just looking at obviously Xyratex taken out by Seagate. Can you just comment on your view of testers and gate relationship with Teradyne?", "Stephen Milligan", "Yeah. So really couple of things. It's a little bit hard to respond to that, specifically at this point Rich, because Seagate has, to my knowledge, made no specific comment externally in terms of what their plans are, with the Xyratex organization, and more specifically, as it relates to their tester business. That being said, we are obviously looking at various different ways that we can manage any potential impact that might occur, related to that transaction, and part of that has to do with our relationship with Teradyne.", "Richard Kugele - Needham and Company", "Certainly, I guess then from your manufacturing footprint today, you feel comfortable you have enough flexibility in your testing capacity?", "Stephen Milligan", "Yes.", "Richard Kugele - Needham and Company", "Okay. Then lastly, because I have been asked the question, many disruptions from the unrest in Thailand. I know, you guys have been there very-very long time, and are seeing these things from time to time, but this could have been asked?", "Stephen Milligan", "Yeah, and no disruption, and we are obviously monitoring the situation very-very closely. One of our primary things, is to continue to make sure that our facilities and employees are safe, and the disruptions have been occurring in about the center of Bangkok. Our facilities, we have two primary facilities in Thailand that are pretty well outside the Bangkok area, but we do have employees that are located and so we are making sure that we have got appropriate transportation for them, and that sort of thing, so that our facilities and our employees are protected. And we certainly, to your point -- Rich, we have seen this before. We don't -- we continue to take it seriously, because it could become more volatile, so we got to keep a close eye on it. But we clearly have a number of different contingency plans in place to make sure that we can work through various different situations, to ensure appropriate supply to our customers, and protection of our employees.", "Richard Kugele - Needham and Company", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is open.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus", "Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, first question for me is, just to go into the free cash flow generation. You have been very consistently north of $2 billion in free cash flow, but one of the things that's interesting is your cash conversion cycle is notably above your four to eight day target range, which is reiterated in the material today. So just curious, how you are thinking about free cash flow generation as we look forward, and kind of tying that back to, how do we get from a 19-day cash conversion cycle, down to that four to eight day range, if that's your stated target?", "Timothy Leyden", "Yes, this is Tim. We have got opportunity in inventory, definitely and we have actually been in transition a little bit, because we got a higher percentage of our total business, which is now enterprise driven. So consequently, that does place a little bit of pressure on inventory. In addition to that, we have been utilizing finished goods for two purposes, first of all to smooth out some of the linearity challenges, because we are making choices to take spikes out of the production, and to build ahead, where necessary, and to carry a little bit extra inventory, that's one particular item from an inventory viewpoint.", "Secondly, we have also been making choices to put more inventory on the ocean, to help our cost of goods sold. So we are working the inventory pretty much, in order to get to optimum positions, and I think we have got some room there.", "In terms of DSOs, we got worse on DSOs quarter-on-quarter, and that's driven a little bit by the peculiar linearity in the December quarter; because -- Steve already mentioned that the timing of Chinese New Year in the current quarter, the early timing of it, was driving some different behavior by customers. But the timing of the Christmas period was also an issue. So consequently, what we saw a little lighter linearity in the October timeframe, and a bit stronger linearity in the November timeframe. So consequently, we had to carry a couple of more days, DSOs, as a result of that.", "And our four to eight, we are going to reevaluate it, because I do think that there were some differences in our business that now have to be dealt with, and we are going to have to reevaluate if the four to eight is really appropriate. But we certainly got opportunity there in order to be able to generate more cash, and of course, we got to keep the profitability and Steve talked a little bit about also about driving higher gross margin, higher ROC and that would help us also to continue to generate -- strong cash generation that we have been seeing for eight quarters now, in excess of $500 million.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, great.", "Stephen Milligan", "And just to add one comment to that, just quickly. Absent Tim's comment in terms of -- because we are evaluating whether or not the four to eight makes sense, given different dynamics in our business, which I think is -- which is obviously appropriate. The other thing is, is that, there is no way that we are going to get within that range, under the whole separate arrangement. The whole separate arrangement continues to drive inefficiencies in our business from a financial perspective, which we obviously believe, translates to value that we can provide to our customers, and so we will be looking for an opportunity to request that that be lifted in March, and that should help us address some of this as well.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus", "Great. As a quick follow-up I'd just like to understand, as you think about the SSD business growing and kind of growing to your model, so first of all, what was the dilutive impact that we recognized in the December quarter? Do you still see a $0.20 dilution in total for fiscal 2015, and how do we think about that business ramping in the context of gross margin flowing, on a consolidated P&L?", "Timothy Leyden", "On a quarterly basis, it's a dilution of about $0.10 per quarter, and from a gross margin viewpoint, we measure that business on basis of ROIC and it's at the high end of our ROIC range.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus", "Perfect. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "Hi guys. I wanted to go back to TAM for a second. Last year in March, at this same conference call, you guided revenues for the March quarter to be down, four to six I believe it was; revenues end up coming down sequentially about 2%, and the TAM was relatively flattish. So to Katie's question, I think you intimated that the TAM would be, in the low 130 range, 133, 135. I understand Chinese New Year is a few weeks earlier this year than last. But what's really the difference on how you are thinking about the TAM this year, versus last year? Because it seems like a pretty big drop-off, or is there certainly some element of conservatism in there?", "Stephen Milligan", "Let me comment on that. Really, the dynamics that we are seeing, just to kind of oversimplify it, is it's primarily related to the PC market. And I know there has been a lot of commentary or speculation in terms of what's happening in the PC market. Let me give you our perspective on that.", "We have seen the PC market, I will call it, begin to stabilize. Obviously, the PC market still shrunk in calendar Q4, and so, it's less bad than what it used to be. However, there is still a fair amount of cautiousness on behalf of our customers, in terms of what the demand environment is going to look like, in terms of the first half calendar 2014. That cautiousness is factored into the guidance that we have provided. And not only that, the visibility that our customers have, is a bit -- I mean, in terms of demand environment, they're just very cautious.", "Now that being said, I think, one very important point is that our customers in my view, in our visibility or knowledge of the PC channel, inventory is the best we know it, it's in very-very healthy shape. In other words, what I mean by that, is --", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "Gambling.", "Stephen Milligan", "And so that's very good. So if there does happen to be, at this time, an unanticipated pickup in PC demand, that's not reflected in our numbers, obviously that will translate to upside to our numbers, in the March quarter. There is still a fair amount of cautiousness out there, Keith.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Thank you. Then my follow-up, perhaps if you can lay out as best you can, a framework or a schedule with milestones, as you think about your discussions with MOFCOM and the Chinese; how should we thinking about the sequence of events, the Chinese events and the impact of both, number one, your OpEx, and then number two, the opportunities with cost of goods sold. Thank you.", "Stephen Milligan", "Sure. I will comment on the process, as best I can. Just to remind everybody, in March, we have the opportunity, I will call it reapply or submit a request to MOFCOM for them to lift the whole separate restriction. In terms of how the process plays out from there, I am sorry to say, I don't know how that's going to play out. We don't have a lot of visibility to that, it's a new process. In other words, we are either the first, or one of the first companies to actually reapply for that to be lifted. So we are going to have to see how that goes. In the meantime, our working relationship, more from the standpoint of us complying with all the separate, continues with MOFCOM and continues to be constructive, and we will continue a dialog with them, as we get closer to March to aid us in having more transparency in terms of how the process will unfold, and we will inform the investment community, as we learn more -- as to how that's going to play out.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, great.", "Stephen Milligan", "In terms of the impact on our financial results, what we have said is that, we believe that it will allow us to realize OpEx synergies of about $100 million a quarter. We have not quantified the impact from a gross margin perspective, but obviously, it will be beneficial to our gross margin profile as well.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Fair enough. Thanks guys. I will cede the floor.", "Operator", "Next question is from Mark Miller with Noble Financial Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Mark Miller - Noble Financial Capital Markets", "Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the quarter. IBM reported, I think Intel also reported that the server business was somewhat softer, and there are some specifics there for both firms, for example, Intel, they had some problems with its motherboard shipments, with its new Xenon chip. And I am just wondering about the enterprise market. You have been flat there for the last couple of quarters on units. Were there some industry specific things that are impacting the market, and how does that look?", "Stephen Milligan", "We were not affected by any of that, and had no visibility to that. So as I indicated earlier, the performance enterprise business, which would be directly applicable to server related activity, pretty much came in along our expectations.", "Mark Miller - Noble Financial Capital Markets", "Okay. And just as a follow-up. Did you see any strengthening, or have you seen any strengthening as this quarter began or as the last quarter ended? Have we seen linear results or just normal seasonality?", "Stephen Milligan", "Are you talking about the March quarter?", "Mark Miller - Noble Financial Capital Markets", "The current quarter, I mean, is that showing any -- is it just showing normal seasonality?", "Stephen Milligan", "Well the March quarter, as we talked about earlier, Chinese New Year is early this year, earlier than normal. Also we got some, rather large OEM customers, with January year-ends or quarter ends; and so, linearity so far in the March quarter has been strong. The question is, is how sustainable is that, as we get past Chinese New Year, as well as, when we move into, what traditionally would be weaker times of the year, March and then obviously April, but that's the next year. But those typically, from a seasonal perspective, are getting into the weaker times of the year for us.", "Mark Miller - Noble Financial Capital Markets", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Scott Craig with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Scott Craig - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. Good afternoon. Steve, I was just wondering, on the PC market, you talked about next quarter, the conservatism. How much of that is coming from the consumer market versus the commercial market? And then from an OpEx standpoint, let's just make the assumption that MOFCOM doesn't get released anytime soon. But what's the right sort of OpEx range that you guys can run it in? Is it the $600 million you are talking about next quarter or can you gradually burn some of that down a little bit, back into that 500, 595 range you talked about historically? Thanks.", "Stephen Milligan", "So on the PC front, just to add a little bit more color. We have seen, where the strength is coming, it has been in the commercial segment. So the cautiousness is clearly in the consumer market, and so that's that. Let me give a little bit of context to the OpEx situation, and then I will have Tim comment on the specific numbers.", "We are in a bit of a transitioning kind of period, really for two different reasons. One is, is that we have got the pending application or submission to MOFCOM, and what may or may not be the outcome of that, which at this time, we don't know what the decision would be.", "The second thing is, that we have got these recent acquisitions that we have done, and investments that we are making in enterprise SSD. One of the things that we want to make sure we know that we are disadvantaged from a financial perspective, versus our -- in this case, largest competitor, OpEx perspective; because we are required to carry, in some cases, 2X of whatever happens to be from an investment perspective, given the regulatory situation that we are in.", "One of the things that we want to make sure that we are doing, which does drive a higher level of OpEx, is that we are investing appropriately in some of these new initiatives. And so, as we go through this transition period, finding that right level of OpEx is a bit more challenging, than otherwise it would. So that provides a bit more context, in terms of -- from the business perspective, what we are dealing with, in terms of our operating expenses. So Tim can comment on the specific numbers.", "Timothy Leyden", "So, our guide for the December quarter was -- for non-GAAP was $595 million. We actually came in on GAAP at around $616 million. The major difference there were driven by the stock appreciation rates, which covered more than 60% of the difference between those two numbers, and the balance was performance incentives. And in the near to mid term, I think the 600 run rate is probably a better number to go with for now. So a $600 million number is one that you should be plugging into the model.", "Scott Craig - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question is from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Hi, thank you. I was hoping to get a little bit of detail on your cash flexibility. Tim, I think you said you have $700 million in cash in the US. I know you have a strategy of spending about 60% of your free cash flow on dividends and buybacks. But it looks like your US cash is getting a little tight. So I just wanted to get a sense of, how much longer you can sustain that? I know you just did a refinance of your debt, so may be some detail there would be helpful?", "Timothy Leyden", "Yeah Sherri. You're right, and the number is 700 million as we close the quarter. However, the renegotiation of the bank loan did improve our position. We did that renegotiation for a number of reasons, the first one being, obviously taking advantage of the market conditions. And we also got lower rates, we got longer time period extending from 2017 up to 2019. We upsized the facility also, and the biggest advantage relative to your question, is that we brought it from offshore to onshore. So consequently, the $700 million now has the capability to be able to be up around $3 billion or so.", "So consequently, we have taken action in order to ensure that we don't get tight, relative to continuing to meet our obligations of what we have promised on the capital allocation front.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thanks Tim, that's helpful. And then I guess also, wanted an update on your CapEx plan. I know you guys are in the middle of upgrading your wafer facility, that took a couple of years. Is that finished, and what would you view as the investments you need to make in CapEx this year? Thanks.", "Timothy Leyden", "Yeah, we'd be able to stay within our 5% to 7% model. Actually, for the first couple of quarters, I think we have been running more like 4%, and we are -- from a CapEx viewpoint, I think we are underutilized in [heads]. We are underutilized also in substrates and sputtering going out as much underutilized in hedge. And of course in assembly and in tests, we continue to balance that and respond to the market. So I think, we are pretty comfortable within the model, the 5% to 7% model.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "And the wafer is done, is that right or no?", "Timothy Leyden", "Yes.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question is from Mark Moskowitz with JP Morgan. Your line is open.", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan", "I just want to build off of Sherri's question on CapEx. Steve, what's kind of your view, if the market or the TAM improves by 5% to 7% this year, which is hypothetical, what would be your response? Would you kind of be measured and not really have that capacity during the first few quarters, or would you have to add at a pretty big pace? I guess, we are just kind of curious, in terms of what would be the kind of puts and takes that you have to really increase the CapEx?", "Stephen Milligan", "I think we are addressing at a little bit more general level. I think that we are in a pretty good shape from an overall capacity perspective. In other words, you saw the TAM increase to the number that you are talking about, we would not have to add a lot of capacity. We might have to add a bit of test assembly, but that tends to be lower cost. So I would expect that our capital budget or capital spending should be closer to the low end of that 5% to 7%, and certainly, where we are at year-to-date, we are actually below that. So I don't envision us making any meaningful capital additions this year, that would strike that number upwards.", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan", "Okay. Then the other question is a little more bigger picture. Just given the talent that WD has been hiring as well as acquiring, on the software side, how should investors think about your longer term kind of place in the ecosystem of the data center? Are you going to have more of an impact in terms of helping design architect systems versus building the devices that go in the systems, and how does that impact your interaction with both the end customer as well as the OEM customer?", "Stephen Milligan", "Well, that's a bit of a complicated question, in the sense that the storage ecosystem, as we have alluded to, is changing quite dramatically, in a number of different ways, and for really, all participations. So that is for us, and our primary competitors, it is for, I will call, our traditional customers, and its also for some of our newer, you may call it, non-traditional customers, so some of the hyperscale guys. Also, the used cases, in other words, what people are doing with data, is changing quite dramatically. That then gets into increased complexity, increased fragmentation, increased opportunity for us, and if you want to call it, increased customization. That's allowing us the opportunity, whether it happens to be by providing additional peers from a cost perspective, if it happens to be adding different value from a software perspective, it allows us the opportunity to add value to our customers, whether they be hyperscale or traditional customers, any different way.", "As we do that, and if we do it -- if we execute appropriately, that certainly does provide us with the opportunity to look at margin expansion over time. We are certainly not committing to that, but we do think that that's an opportunity that we should be striving to realize, as we move forward.", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks a lot. Good afternoon guys. Couple of questions for me, maybe if you could talk about your enterprise business, looks like total units are kind of flat on a sequential basis. Any dynamics you see within the business [critical] and capacity optimized side would be helpful.", "Stephen Milligan", "Nothing particular in terms of performance or capacity enterprise. Capacity enterprise can be a bit lumpy. In other words, it's a little bit project based. We did, and I am not concerned about this, everybody is aware. I think we did lose a bit of share in the quarter, that just tends to be the lumpiness about particular projects and which customers and that kind of thing, but the long term -- and the overall industry level from a demand perspective, things played out more or less as we expected it. Nothing to really speak of, and we continue to feel very positive about how we are positioned from an overall competitive standpoint.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Got it. And then, I guess if I look at the free cash flow generation, which you guys talked about as obviously being very strong for the last couple of quarters now, how do you think about the 50 commitment -- or kind of 50% of free cash flow back to shareholders? Given the deals that you guys have done, and now you have a good portfolio in the far side, do you start to evaluate that and potentially move that number higher, or do you need the MOFCOM decision to be behind you, to revalue that 50% threshold?", "Stephen Milligan", "Certainly, the MOFCOM decision would help and the synergies that we would pick up from that, would certainly be a help. But we do evaluate the percentage of free cash flow that they are allocating. When we made the decision in September of 2012, those are pretty big decisions for the company. It was something that we hadn't done before. So we are at the point where we are constantly evaluating it, and once we see that there is an opportunity to be able to respond to it, and particularly if we get some significant synergies from integration, then we would look more favorable at increasing it.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital, your line is open.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital", "Hey, thanks guys for taking the question. Two if I could, I guess the first one is back to gross margins, Steve and Tim. Steve, earlier, you commented that, I guess that you thought the meaningful driver is, our ability to add value, and then if you mix appropriately and sort of get at the integrated and a responsible way, does that often suggest that TAM stays, let's call it like a 130 to 145 range where it has kind of been the last six to eight quarters, that you would also have the expectation for margins to continue to appreciate over time?", "Stephen Milligan", "So, if you go back to what we have talked about, in terms of longer term unit growth, which we talked about in September of 2012, we have not updated our expectations at this point. But we talked about a longer term 3% unit growth. The real big swing factor there is what actually happens with PC sales. That does not assume growth in PC sales, it's more so the question is what exactly -- because that's such a big part of the number, right. So my comment, if the TAM dropped significantly, then obviously we'd have to look at something. But I don't think -- we are not assuming that there is going to be meaningful TAM expansion from an overall perspective. So the TAM was in the 135-ish range, just kind of use that as a round number. My comment that I made in terms of margin expansion stands.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital", "Okay, great. That's very helpful. Then just a follow-up for me guys, what are your TAM expectations for 2014 calendar?", "Stephen Milligan", "We haven't given a number, and at this point, I don't think we are going to be giving a number. We have to kind of wait and see. There is still a fair amount of cautiousness out there, uncertainty. But again, we will have to continue to monitor.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital", "Okay great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Next is from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird. Your line is open.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc", "Okay, thank you. Steve, I wanted to come back to your comment and the prepared remarks about customization in the cloud. I assume this relates back to the helium drive, but do you expect to see a fairly wide portfolio with specs that may be differ by customer or by industry vertical?", "Stephen Milligan", "Yes. I mean, in other words, the used cases that we are seeing for various different customers are different. So accordingly, the solutions or the product suite that they are looking for, varies. So there may be some customers that go to extremes, that have no interest in enterprise SSDs, for whatever reason. And then you may have other customers that have a high degree of interest in that, but no interest in the helium-filled drive.", "So it depends upon how they are utilizing data in their organization that\u2019s impacting how we work with those particular customers.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc", "It's a really interesting dynamic. I assume more R&D spend would be involved and likely, higher ASP products and higher profit product also.", "Stephen Milligan", "Right.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Steven Fox with Cross Research, your line is open.", "Steven Fox - Cross Research", "Thanks. Good afternoon. Just two questions for me. First off, it looks like your average capacity per drive accelerated for the first time in about three quarters. Can you sort of talk about how much of that trend is sustainable, going out over the next few quarters and what drove it in the most recent quarter? And then secondly, I think you mentioned the SSD sales of 155 million, I guess there were sort of -- I guess a one time in there. Just sort of how impactful is that, as we look towards the next quarter on a sequential basis?", "Timothy Leyden", "I will address the average gigabyte and Steve will address the SSD. So average gigabyte -- contributing to that was a couple of factors. The first one is the strength of branded products, and that has a significantly higher per drive capacity than the rest of the consumer business, and of course, we also had strong distribution channel in the quarter. So that drove most of that improvement.", "Stephen Milligan", "Then in terms of enterprise SSD, the sole source opportunity was meaningful enough that we felt compelled to comment on it obviously. And given that, and that it is a bit of a non-recurring situation that we may see, our revenue declined slightly going into this quarter. But obviously, it's still a bit early to call that for sure.", "Steven Fox - Cross Research", "And just to follow-up on that, I mean, depending on who you talk to, you could see enterprise SSD demand be as high as 30%, 40%? If not greater, depending on what you think about capital spending. I mean, is that the type of industry you're sort of benchmarking against, when you talk about outperforming the industry in coming quarters?", "Stephen Milligan", "Yes.", "Steven Fox - Cross Research", "Perfect. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question is from Joe Yoo with Citi Research. Your line is open.", "Joe Yoo - Citigroup Global Markets", "Thank you. So your hard drive ASPs were meaningfully, on a sequential basis, despite gaming actually being strong. So wanted to ask, what drove the increase, and related to that, can you provide some color on the like-for-like pricing and cost declines for the quarter, and were they better or worse than expected?", "Timothy Leyden", "So pricing was driven again by the strength of the channel and the strength of the consumer in branded, and that goes then to drive higher average ASP, and from a cost viewpoint, the cost to time has slowed down, because the area of density improvement has slowed down. So what we are seeing is, somewhere in the region of between 1% and 2% of cost decline, and pricing is following cost decline. So we are seeing pricing decline moderation as well, as a result of that.", "Joe Yoo - Citigroup Global Markets", "And as a follow-up of the enterprise SSD space business. You guided again for another $0.10 dilution from the acquisition in the March quarter. So should we be modeling a $0.10 dilution for much of this year, this calendar year, or should we be looking at some kind of release from that dilution, as we get into the second half?", "Timothy Leyden", "That dilution will remain pretty much right through the end of the year; because we began to see the accretion in the early part of 2013. So consequently, we should keep that dilution in the model, through the calendar year.", "Joe Yoo - Citigroup Global Markets", "Great. Thank you, Tim.", "Operator", "Next is from Nehal Chokshi with Technology Insights Research. Your line is open.", "Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research", "Yes. Thanks for taking my question. With the stability in My Cloud, can you provide any metrics around the traction you are getting with this, and also, is it reasonable to believe that this is an incremental TAM above the current blended market and the increased functionality, [and in terms of] ASPs companies like DropBox are charging beyond initial free capacity? Anything you can do to help us size the opportunity, incremental (inaudible) would be definitely helpful?", "Stephen Milligan", "Yeah, it's an interesting question. I am not sure, that at this point we have an updated analysis incremental to the traditional business versus, just substituting other units. And so, I think we will have to continue to monitor that. Relative to specific data, we traditionally have not broken out specific sales of a given product, and so, we are very encouraged by the response from the marketplace so far. We have, I will call it, high expectations for continued success in 2014.", "Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research", "And if I may, if I could ask about desktops. Not quite sure I understand why desktops were down, and Dell recorded an 11% increase year-over-year in desktops from their perspective?", "Stephen Milligan", "We had a bit of share loss, and that's reflective of the industry. Desktop, as an overall statement, is a pretty stable market.", "Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe Wittine with Longbow Research. Your line is open.", "Joseph Wittine - Longbow Research", "Hi thanks. I think the enterprise has been beat to death pretty well, but I might ask the question again. You saw the flattening in the back half of the year, I am just curious, what's a reasonable expectation for unit growth going forward as you look into calendar 2014. From reading between what you said, it sounds like we got a little bit of a pause in some of the capacity you've build out. So looking out over the next four quarters, theoretically, some of those ebbs and flows kind of get smoothed out, we are still looking at a high single digit/10% kind of unit number that I think you last spoke about, at your most recent Analyst Day?", "Timothy Leyden", "Yeah. What we are looking for is somewhere in the region of high single digits on an annual basis, particularly in capacity. In performance, that's going to be pretty much flat, I would say.", "Joseph Wittine - Longbow Research", "Okay, great. And then on the cash return to shareholders, it seems like right now you are actually trending closer to 40% of the current run rate. You understand, maybe the cash flow weakens with the seasonality coming up here in the first half of the calendar year. But is that kind of the rate right now to expect, perhaps as you are still incurring $25 million a quarter for the Seagate court ruling, or could there be a step-up there, even -- absent a court ruling and absent a MOFCOM ruling, let's say?", "Timothy Leyden", "I was trying to be pretty precise about it, but our objective is to meet our obligations, which is to pay out 50% of the free cash flow. Unfortunately, there were a couple of things that happened in the December quarter, which mitigated against that. One of them was, we had to pay for the Virident acquisition; and also, we had the secondary offering with Hitachi, and both of those didn't allow us to be able to be exiting the market during the period that those things were open. So consequentially, that mitigated against our opportunity to get to the 50%.", "Joseph Wittine - Longbow Research", "Okay. Then finally, very quick follow-up Tim; the $0.10 dilution that's there from the SSD acquisition, is that totally on the OpEx line, and if that's the case, is it about $20 million, $25 million per quarter in that range?", "Timothy Leyden", "Yeah, it's mostly in the OpEx line.", "Joseph Wittine - Longbow Research", "Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Next question is from Rob Cihra with Evercore Partners. Your line is open.", "Rob Cihra - Evercore Partners", "Thanks very much. Hopefully I can get two questions in, just to keep the pattern going. One just on hybrid drives, I know we talked about them all of a sudden. Just wondering, what your progress is like there in the December quarter, maybe versus your expectations? And then separate from that, and gaming, given that you -- given the strong start for the new game console cycles, obviously it has helped the past couple of quarters. If you look at seasonality in that, if not cyclicality and through the year, how do you plan for that, given you don't have necessarily the same sort of seasonality you might have in most businesses, just more of a cyclicality to it, and particularly maybe Steve, you have history there from your Hitachi days, how do you plan for that, given that it's sort of driven by two customers? Thanks.", "Stephen Milligan", "Yeah. So on the hybrid, the volumes for 2013 were modest, which was more or less consistent with what our expectations and what we have said historically and it remains the case, is that, hybrid is more of a 2014 story for us. We will have to continue and see, at what level we make momentum from a customer perspective, acceptance of that kind of a solution. But things are tracking to our expectations. We did not expect the volumes to be that large in 2013.", "Relative to gaming, it's an interesting question. There is not really seasonality there. I mean, there is a bit of it, in terms of when they build. But they tend to build earlier in the year, put them on [boats], get them stocked up and save on the shipping costs and that sort of thing. So I would say that we're very encouraged by the reception to the new gaming consoles, and I think that that, and also the fact that it's a one-to-one attach rate with hard drives. We do not obviously have all of that business, but we participate in a very healthy rate with the two customers that you commented on and we do view that as a bit of a tailwind for the drive industry going into 2014.", "Rob Cihra - Evercore Partners", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Stephen Milligan", "So, thank you all for joining us, and we look forward to updating you as we go forward. So thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Welcome to Western Digital's third quarter financial results for fiscal year 2014. [Operator instructions.] Now, I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.", "Robert Blair", "Thank you. We will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions concerning, among others, our position in the growth of data and storage ecosystem, stabilization of demand in our business, demand trends in the enterprise space, our product offerings and our customers\u2019 responses to our product offerings, and our financial performance, including our financial results and expectations for the June quarter. ", "These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on January 31, 2014. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events.", "In addition, references will be made during the call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the quarterly fact sheet posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. ", "The forward-looking guidance we provide during this call excludes amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions of HGST, VeloBit, sTec and Virident; asset impairment and other charges; charges related to litigation; and expense due to the writeoff of debt issuance costs.", "Because the amount of these items is not fully known to us at this time, we are unable to provide guidance for, or a reconciliation to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures.", "We ask that participants limit their comments to a single question and one follow-up question in our Q&A session. I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investor's section of Western Digital's website immediately following the conclusion of this call.", "I\u2019d now turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer of Western Digital Steve Milligan.", "Steve Milligan", "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, Tim Leyden will provide additional commentary on our March quarter performance and our outlook for the June quarter.", "We achieved solid financial results for the March quarter, with revenue in line with our expectations and gross margin and earnings per share exceeding our guidance. Cash generation remained strong. Our steady financial performance continues to demonstrate an ability to manage the business and deliver ongoing value to our customers and shareholders.", "Both of our subsidiaries executed well in the March quarter, as we continue to participate in the ongoing growth of data with an intense focus on helping our customers succeed in a rapidly changing environment.", "Our results reflect sustained strength in gaming, anticipated seasonality in client and branded products, and some softness in the enterprise space. The industry TAM was slightly higher than anticipated, driven by the strength in gaming.", "We continue to see demand stabilizing in the commercial side of our client business as part of a PC refresh cycle, and we remain positive about the long term demand trends in the enterprise space. The continued strength in gaming is due to consumers\u2019 healthy demand for the newest game console designs, all of which have integrated hard drives. Overall, we believe industry supply and demand remain in balance. ", "We continue to believe very excited about our unique position in the overall storage ecosystem, enabling a broad-based perspective on the dramatic changes that are underway. Customers are responding positively to a number of new products and technologies we are bringing to market to help them to be successful.", "Specifically, our enterprise class SSD business had another strong quarter. We will continue to expand our full range of enterprise SSD products, including SAS, PCIe, and SATA, in a range of form factors and capacity points, as well as grow our software and solution offerings.", "Several strategic OEM customers have qualified our 6 TB helium filled drive, and we are shipping to them in volume. The product is generally available on a global basis, resulting in broad adoption in all geographies. It is important to note that our innovative helium technology platform is extendable to higher capacities and additional applications. ", "We recently began shipping a new family of highest-performance, high capacity 2.5 inch 15K hard drives. Our customers continue to use 15K hard drives with SSDs in tiered pools of storage, and this new product addresses the industry\u2019s shift away from the 3.5 inch form factor to smaller 2.5 inch drives to help manage space requirements.", "Customers have responded very positively to our Power of Choice lineup of hard drives, including the WD Red drives that ship primarily to value-added resellers who are configuring mass systems for small and medium businesses. Likewise, the new WD Purple series addresses security surveillance mass systems for the home and small businesses.", "Both of these are high-growth segments where storage is a value-added means to an end for the customer, which makes them attractive opportunities for us. We continue to see opportunities with our My Cloud network attached storage solutions in the home and small office segment. Our My Cloud solution provides the opportunity to connect with billions of devices that create, store, and display massive amounts of data.", "All of these products reflect our highly focused strategy of helping our customers succeed through collaboration and innovation and are contributing to the favorable mix shift underway in our business to higher growth and higher value-added segments of the market.", "Before turning it over to Tim, I wanted to address the topic of our discussions with China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce. Consistent with our prior commentary, we had the opportunity to submit a request in March for MofCom to lift the hold separate restrictions on our business. We have done so and we continue to work with MofCom as they review our submission.", "In the meantime, we continue to operate our HGST and WD subsidiaries separately and we will keep you informed of any material developments. ", "Tim?", "Timothy Leyden", "Thank you, Steve. Our March quarter performance reflected healthy unit demand and solid execution. The hard drive industry shipped approximately 137 million units during the March quarter, which was higher than the TAM implied in the guidance we provided in January.", "In our business, we saw continued strength in gaming, anticipated seasonal declines in client and branded products, and some softness in enterprise. Aggregated channel inventories of Western Digital products remain at the low end of our 4 to 6 week range.", "Our revenue for the March quarter was $3.7 billion, including $134 million from enterprise SSDs. Our enterprise SSD revenue was slightly better than we had expected, and some of the single source strengths we saw in the December quarter carried into the March quarter.", "We continue to expect that our SSD enterprise business will outpace the market\u2019s revenue growth rate over the long term. Overall, 53% of our revenue came from non-PC applications. We shipped a total of 60.4 million hard drives at an average selling price of $58. The quarter over quarter decline in overall ASP was primarily driven by business mix. ", "Our gross margin for the quarter was 28.6%. Excluding $39 million of amortization expense for required intangible assets, as well as $16 million of restructuring charges, our non-GAAP gross margin was 30.1%. We exceeded our implied guidance for non-GAAP gross margin by 60 basis points, primarily due to operational efficiencies and better utilization.", "R&D and SG&A spending totaled $628 million for the March quarter. SG&A included the following items: $11 million of amortization expense for required intangible assets, and $4 million of restructuring and other charges. R&D included $8 million of restructuring charges. We accrued interest charges of $13 million in the March quarter relating to the Seagate arbitration matter. ", "Tax expense for the March quarter was $31 million or, or 8% of pretax income. Net interest expense for the March quarter was $13 million, and included $4 million of debt issuance costs that were expensed with the payoff of the prior credit facility.", "Our net income for the March quarter totaled $375 million or $1.55 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $470 million or $1.94 per share.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we generated $697 million in cash from operations and our free cash flow totaled $536 million. Our capex for the March quarter totaled $161 million or 4% of revenue. We repurchased 2.8 million shares for $244 million during the March quarter. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.30 per share.", "We entered Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $5 billion, of which approximately $2.3 billion was in the U.S.", "I\u2019ll now provide our guidance for the June quarter. We expect revenue to be seasonally down and in a range of $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion; gross margin approximately at the midpoint of our 27% to 32% model, excluding the amortization of intangibles; R&D and SG&A spending around $600 million, also excluding the amortization of intangibles; a tax rate of approximately 8%; a share count of approximately 242 million.", "Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.65 and $1.75, for the June quarter, which includes the dilution impact of approximately $0.10 of the sTec and Virident acquisitions. As a reminder, we expect the sTec, VeloBit, and Virident acquisitions to be accretive early in calendar year 2015. ", "Overall, we continue to execute well, and we are well-positioned to succeed in the evolving storage market. In closing, I want to point out to investors and analysts that our fiscal year 2015 will consist of 53 weeks, with the first quarter ending October 3, 2014, consisting of 14 weeks, and the second, third, and fourth quarters at 13 weeks each. ", "Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator instructions.] And our first question comes from Aaron Rakers of Stifel. ", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel", "First question would be on the enterprise relative weakness. Maybe you can help us understand how the quarter progressed, where maybe in particular you saw the weakness, be it between the traditional enterprise guys, relative to the cloud vendors, and then how we should anticipate that business looking into the current quarter. ", "Stephen Milligan", "The primary area where we saw a bit of weakness in terms of enterprise demand was in capacity enterprise. Not so much traditional performance enterprise in terms of our business. That more or less tracked to our expectations. I think just to kind of put a little bit of context on this, one of the things to keep in mind as a general statement is that one, the volumes for capacity enterprise on a relative basis are not that large in terms of relative to the total TAM. ", "The other thing is that the number of customers, it tends to be dominated by a relatively few number of customers. So any changes in purchasing behavior on the part of some of those larger customers can have a relatively significant impact on the overall numbers. So that\u2019s just a little bit of context.", "With that being said, basically what we saw was increased efficiency from the standpoint of some of our significant hyperscale buyers. And efficiency is coming in the form of really a few things. One, supply chain efficiencies and efficiencies in the way that they deploy capacity from their standpoint through their deployments, and also, in terms of improved utilization, in terms of the overall storage capacity. ", "So they\u2019re basically working off inventory that they already had in place, because of, if you want to call it, inefficiencies in their deployments. We see that persisting through our current quarter that we\u2019re in, our fiscal Q4, and we expect that demand will pick up in the second half of the year, more in line with what we\u2019ve been seeing in the past. And so it\u2019s a short term dynamic in terms of the first and the second calendar quarter of this year, and we don\u2019t expect to persist longer term.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel ", "And as a follow up real quickly, I know you\u2019re not giving any updated thoughts around MofCom, but as we look at your business model and look at the utilization rates of your manufacturing, can you help us understand where you stand utilization wise, be it internal versus external on heads and media, and maybe how much opportunity exists to driving more efficiency or utilization out of those key assets?", "Stephen Milligan ", "I\u2019ll take a stab at that and then Tim can add to that as appropriate. First off, we\u2019re very comfortable right now in terms of where we\u2019re at with our internal versus external component purchases, really, on both subs. And frankly, they\u2019re at relatively consistent levels, coincidentally, not through any inappropriate coordination. They just happened to be at very similar levels in terms of the percentage of internal versus external components for both heads and media.", "And generally speaking, that\u2019s been fairly consistent over the last few quarters, so we haven\u2019t seen any material change in that. From an overall utilization perspective and expected synergies that we might happen to realize if we are able to combine, we have not provided a specific number on that in terms of cost synergies. We have provided an indication of what we thought it would be on the opex side, but needless to say, it will be meaningful in terms of the reduction in terms of cost that we\u2019ll see on our cost of goods sold if we\u2019re able to combine the two entities.", "And so clearly we think that will be a benefit, not only to our shareholders, but in particular to our customers, and will allow us to continue to fund the required innovations that we need to deal with the changing storage ecosystem that we\u2019re dealing with.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. ", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Just geographically, Asia was up, EMEA was down. Can you just put any color around that? And then I\u2019ve got a follow up.", "Timothy Leyden", "It was at the noise level, really. There was some movement in there, but it was relatively insignificant. So there wasn\u2019t anything really that was significant that would cause us to call it out separately.", "Stephen Milligan ", "One thing that I would call out is that obviously we saw strength in the gaming side of our business. That is all attributable to Asia. Because it\u2019s shipped into location, as opposed to where those ultimate systems get deployed. And so that might have something to do with that increase in Asia.", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company ", "And as a follow up, would you have a similar level of optimism for the second half of the calendar year as your primary competitor, both the PC client side as well as the hyperscale guys, coming back in ordering? I think you commented a little bit about that, but any other color you might have?", "Stephen Milligan ", "In terms of the second half of the year, we are optimistic about the enterprise side of the business, and so in that regard, I would say that we would concur with what our largest competitor has said. ", "On the PC side, and Rich, you know us well, we probably tend to be a little bit more cautious and a little bit more conservative. We have definitely seen a stabilization in the PC market. Now, it still is declining on a year on year basis. Certainly a lot of that has to do with commercial refresh. The question there is that we don\u2019t know how long the sustainability of that commercial refresh. ", "We believe that we\u2019ll continue to see some of that activity through the June quarter. The question is, does it persist through the back half of the year. Consumer generally speaking, as far as we can tell, continues to be relatively weak, so we\u2019re not really seeing any particular strength there. ", "So I would characterize that we\u2019re probably cautiously optimistic regarding PC demand trends, but I think the stabilization is meaningful in the sense that there\u2019s less volatility. And that decreased volatility just makes it a little bit easier for us to manage and plan around that as opposed to chasing the ball around on the pitch trying to figure out which way it\u2019s going to go next.", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company ", "And just lastly, on ASPs, given the gaming mix, which is presumably a much lower ASP, that going down here in this June quarter, would you expect ASPs to be more firm this quarter, maybe even increase? What should we be expecting here for June?", "Timothy Leyden ", "They\u2019ll be flattish.", "Stephen Milligan ", "Yeah, we\u2019re going to continue to see pretty strong gaming volumes here in the current quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. ", "Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray", "Just another follow up on the PC side. So it looks like both notebooks and desktop units underperformed relative to Seagate this quarter. The results are still in line with your normal 10% decline in calendar Q1, so was there anything abnormal in those segments that you noticed regarding pricing or share shift?", "Stephen Milligan ", "I wouldn\u2019t call anything out specifically from our standpoint. The client business from our perspective - and this is kind of at the margins, so it\u2019s not a significant thing - was a little bit stronger than what we expected. Gaming was certainly stronger than what we expected, and then the enterprise side, which I talked about earlier in terms of capacity enterprise, was a bit weaker. ", "But the stronger PC business that we saw, it was not that significant within the whole grand scheme of things. And competitive behavior was within the norm, I guess you might say. We didn\u2019t see any unusual competitive behavior that would be particularly alarming to us.", "Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray ", "And then if you look at it from a region perspective, were there any large differences between your mature markets and your emerging markets?", "Timothy Leyden ", "I think the consumer business is a bit more impacted by the macroeconomic issues, and as you know, the emerging markets have been challenged really because of the foreign exchange. And so that continues, and we\u2019re seeing that the more mature markets are the stronger ones, and the emerging markets are the weaker ones. And of course the dislocation in Russia didn\u2019t help.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rob Cihra with Evercore.

I guess can you just help map out at all - maybe not specifically map out, although it would be awesome - where that\u2019s revenue driven versus cost cutting driven or cost savings driven? Is it all revenue driven, or is it just hopefully like a smooth ramp from here? Or are there kind of milestones that we can be looking for more specifically?", "Timothy Leyden ", "I think it\u2019s a continuing plan. We\u2019re putting together the multiple roadmaps for sTec, Virident, VeloBit, and the JDA. And as we put those together, we will have some efficiencies that will come from cost. We\u2019ll obviously be building up our revenue. ", "So from where we are right now going towards the end of the year, by the time that we\u2019re exiting December, we will be pretty much at breakeven, or maybe a little bit accretive. And then we\u2019ll be fully accretive in the first quarter. And it will taper between now and then going from the $0.10 to where we are right now, towards that breakeven point in the December quarter, as we exit December. ", "Stephen Milligan ", "Just to add to that, the primary driver is revenue and ramping the new businesses. And the new business being those products that relate to the sTec and Virident acquisition. There are some synergies or rationalization from an opex perspective, but the primary driver will be continuing to ramp from a product perspective, from a revenue perspective, from a customer perspective, those new businesses.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.", "Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs ", "You were pretty clear on the drivers of the enterprise weakness, particularly within the hyperscale customer base.

And how are you thinking about that as we progress through the calendar year?", "Stephen Milligan ", "I don\u2019t know if I would really call anything out, frankly, in terms of that. I mean, it\u2019s a little bit of a challenging question in the sense that we have a number of customers that increasingly are coming more and more direct to the [drive] guys, which is obviously impacting some of the traditional customer base. ", "And so I don\u2019t think we saw anything in particular that stands out with our traditional customer base in the capacity enterprise market that\u2019s worthy of calling out, other than just ongoing challenges of how to remain relevant with some of the changing purchasing behaviors on behalf of some of our customers. ", "Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs ", "And then you had mentioned that you would extend your helium platform to other product lines over time. Can you remind us of how we should think about what this does to your cost structure relative to the competition now and particularly over time as the technology matures?", "Stephen Milligan ", "You mean our cost structure? Or our customer\u2019s cost structure?", "Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs ", "Your cost structure.  ", "Stephen Milligan ", "Well, the primary impact to our cost structure, which has nothing to do per se with helium, the fact that it\u2019s helium sealed, is that as we are shipping higher and higher capacity drives, whether they be 6 or 8 or 10 or whatever it happens to be as the product extends itself over a period of time, is the test times for these products are significant. And so we\u2019re having to add, or will have to add, as volumes ramp, meaningful amounts of test capacity. But that is not unique per se to the helium platform. It just has to do with the amount of data these things are storing.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Monica Garg with Pacific Crest Securities.", "Monica Garg - Pacific Crest Securities ", "The first question is on the enterprise SSD side. Could you maybe talk about do you think in the next quarter you\u2019ll see enterprise demand to be flattish or decline before you see it pick up, as you talked about, in the back half of the year?", "Timothy Leyden ", "Each of the different segments, other than gaming, is likely to be down as you look quarter on quarter.", "Monica Garg - Pacific Crest Securities ", "And the other question I have is on the enterprise SSD. If I look at your June 2013 enterprise revenues, they were about $104 million. And if I add sTec, which was only at about $25 million a quarter, and then you add Virident, VeloBit, and kind of one-time benefit, it seems that revenue is still flattish. Maybe could you talk about kind of when do you expect the pickup in that segment?", "Stephen Milligan ", "I think you\u2019ve got to keep in mind that relative to the sTec side, the momentum there was not exactly positive. So I think you\u2019ve got to consider that really we bought a, I hate to call it this, but a little bit of a distressed asset.", "Monica Garg - Pacific Crest Securities ", "And just a last one on the Xyratex, you were talking recently about the test times increasing on the enterprise side. So maybe can you talk about with Seagate buying Xyratex, does that impact your test strategy somewhat? And kind of how do you see the relationship with the test manufacturers?", "Stephen Milligan ", "We are generally comfortable with where we\u2019re at in terms of our relationship with our test equipment suppliers, including with Xyratex/Seagate.

Was there anything one-time or are whatever positive benefits you saw continuing into the next few quarters?", "Stephen Milligan ", "You know, I want to remain appropriately humble in terms of answering this question, but the reality is that we have a really good team, particularly from a manufacturing perspective, from a cost perspective, on both sides, being WD and HGST, and they are constantly working on eking out every dollar of savings that we can. And so it\u2019s just a matter of sort of scratching and crawling every day, to make sure that we\u2019re realizing appropriate efficiencies and it shows up in our numbers.", "That being said, overall, even though the volumes came in the form of, let\u2019s say, gaming primarily, in terms of upside, which didn\u2019t necessarily translate to higher ASPs and that sort of thing, we did get some additional efficiencies from higher volumes that provided some of that uplift as well. But frankly, I have to take my hat off to our operations team in terms of their ability to grind out cost savings all the time.", "Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley ", "So that should continue?", "Stephen Milligan ", "I certainly hope so.", "Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley ", "And then just lastly, do you need the $2.5 billion of net cash?

So consequently, we are always looking to see what\u2019s best mix, and what\u2019s the best balance between investing in the business for future gain and also making sure that we meet our obligations that we have outlined to shareholders.", "So it\u2019s an ongoing process that we\u2019re looking at, and we continue to look at it. But we\u2019re very pleased with the generation of the cash flow and obviously we keep looking at it.", "Stephen Milligan ", "I think another comment to make, and not to in any way message that we have anything planned, but one of the things that we think is important is that we continue to keep our powder dry in terms of looking at additional opportunities, whether that be M&A or otherwise.

We believe we\u2019ve got our eyes and ears to the ground in terms of trying to understand what\u2019s happening, where we\u2019 can add value from a customer perspective, what we can do from a technology perspective.

", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital. ", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital ", "I guess the first one is a question with part clarification. Did I hear correctly that the expectations for blended ASP is to be flat sequentially in the June quarter? And if that\u2019s the case, I guess in the context of the revenue guidance, which is down 5% quarter over quarter, that would sort of put it all on the TAM is the implication, that you\u2019re expecting TAM of $130 million in the June quarter? ", "Timothy Leyden ", "Yes, we did indicate that the ASP would be flattish, and in line with the seasonality that we\u2019ve historically seen, generally it\u2019s down somewhere in the region of about 4% or so from a quarter over quarter basis. So that\u2019s really where the expectation and the matching of the flat ASP and the revenue guidance is coming from.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital ", "And then the follow up is with regard to gross margin. I guess given that there\u2019s sort of similar revenue decline in the June quarter relative to the December quarter, and the mix isn\u2019t tremendously changing, why wouldn\u2019t you be able to capture similar efficiencies? Steve, to your comment, hopefully they continue in the June quarter. And why couldn\u2019t margins be more flattish? Or is the volume, the down sequential TAM, really that big of an impact?", "Timothy Leyden ", "Yeah, there would be a little bit of a challenge as far as utilization is concerned, when you compare quarter on quarter. So that\u2019s really where the challenge is. From a viewpoint of component reductions, what we\u2019ve seen is that as the volumes stabilize, the component cost reductions have also flattened out a bit, and they\u2019re not as significant as they used to be historically. They\u2019re probably running somewhere in the region of about a half to a third of where they had been previously. So consequently, the utilization takes on a larger significance in that particular mix. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research.", "Steven Fox - Cross Research ", "Just getting back to the SSD business, I guess on a year over year basis, including inorganic activity, you were up 45%. Can you sort of flip that to what kind of organic growth the business is experiencing year on year, and maybe some more color around what was driving it in the most recent quarter? And then sort of expectations for the rest of the year? And then I have a quick follow up.", "Timothy Leyden ", "There\u2019s a lot of moving parts, and you\u2019ve got SAS and SATA and PCIe, all as [unintelligible]. From what we can glean out of it, it looks like on a year on year basis, that the growth is somewhere north of about 50% or so. So we\u2019re just slightly behind where the total market growth rate is.

Because obviously that\u2019s a significant business for you guys.", "Stephen Milligan ", "I don\u2019t know if I would call anything out in particular. I think that in a lot of ways, we were, I\u2019ll call it an early investor in this business, going back to really 2008. And this is on the HGST side initially. And that also corresponds to a lot of the work that we did to improve our position in the broader enterprise market period, and have really developed what we\u2019d like to believe are very tight relationships with a number of enterprise customers, and have broad-based knowledge of the enterprise market and the interaction of storage devices with systems and so on.", "And that\u2019s bearing fruit. And the added credibility that we happen to provide, it may not be entirely showing up in the numbers as of yet. There is some ramp, and not only that, ongoing product development that we need to do. But that credibility will translate to either legacy sTec products, which basically will go away. I mean, call it HGST products going forward, and then not only that, it will translate to PCIe or Virident related products as well. So I think it\u2019s really just a reflection of our ongoing investments in credibility in the broader enterprise market.", "Steven Fox - Cross Research ", "And then just one real quick question. I know you\u2019re not providing guidance on the second half of the calendar year, but there has been some talk about a return to normal seasonality. If that was sort of a baseline, are there any markets where you feel like you could see that come back? I know you expressed some conservatism around PCs, but is there anything where you feel like you could get a seasonal lift at least, if we\u2019re looking at the model second half of the calendar year?", "Stephen Milligan ", "I think the one area that we would call out, and I don\u2019t know if it will necessarily be outside of seasonal norms, it\u2019s probably a little bit too early to call that, but obviously we\u2019re expecting a nice rebound in terms of capacity enterprise demand. So there might be a little bit more strength in that market than what we traditionally have seen. And so that\u2019s the indicators that we\u2019re getting \u201ctoday\u201d. We\u2019ll have to continue to validate that as we move through the balance of the quarter.

It seems like pricing\u2019s been a bit more aggressive as of late. And that would include the near lines. If you could talk about current pricing trends, and then talk about what you see pricing trends over the next couple of quarters.", "Stephen Milligan ", "The one thing that\u2019s tricky about the enterprise space as an overall comment, is that the margins are richer. And that\u2019s traditionally been the case for quite a long time. Therefore, there\u2019s more margin to give away, just by definition. These are indicative numbers as opposed to real numbers, but if you\u2019re running 20% gross margins, there\u2019s not as much profit to give away, and so people are going to be more cautious.", "When you\u2019ve got higher margin products, and you think that there is an opportunity to drive elasticity, you might be compelled to lower those prices more than you otherwise would. And so as a general statement, I would say that probably in the enterprise space, as we begin to see weakness - this is an overall statement, it\u2019s not a statement about us. I\u2019m not pointing the finger. It\u2019s not anything like that. It\u2019s not intended that way. ", "But, you know, people weren\u2019t entirely sure what was going on from a demand perspective. Maybe there was a little bit of a thought, well, maybe there\u2019s elasticity here. So we\u2019re going to maybe look a little bit more at the pricing lever and maybe things got a little bit more aggressive than what made sense. Because there was not the kind of elasticity that you normally would expect.", "And so I think that\u2019s kind of maybe what\u2019s happened over the last few quarters. Going forward, the reality of it is that pricing is always difficult to predict. It just is. And obvious statement, but no one individual or no one individual company controls pricing. And there\u2019s a lot of factors that go into that. ", "The market continues to be competitive, and we are working very closely with all of our customers to find different ways to continue to help them solve the issues that they\u2019re working on to help them create value, whether that be through innovative products, innovative technology, and also making sure that the products are at a cost point for them that makes sense depending upon the economics that they\u2019re trying to drive in their business. ", "So there\u2019s a lot of dynamics that go into pricing, but I do think that given the larger margin pool, it\u2019s a little bit more tempting for guys who look at taking price down than maybe other segments of the market.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets ", "And my follow up is related to TAM. And I\u2019d like to follow up on Ananda\u2019s question. The seasonal guide for June is a little less than seasonal, and I think [unintelligible] Seagate and WD, that\u2019s what it would suggest. What is driving that? Is it the hangover from [SV], or is it the enterprise [near line drive] that\u2019s causing a little less seasonal in June? And [unintelligible] part of the question is, Seagate talked last night about 140 to 145 for the back half of the year. Is that kind of a range you\u2019re comfortable with in the September and December quarters? [unintelligible]", "Stephen Milligan ", "We\u2019re forecasting revenue generally down 4% on a quarter over quarter basis. That, from our perspective, is pretty consistent with normal seasonality.

And overall, I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re really seeing any particular dynamics in a given market, other than the gaming market continues to be healthy. That\u2019s just a good thing in terms of volume absorption and that kind of thing. So that\u2019s kind of helping us a bit.", "So I wouldn\u2019t really call [anything out] there.

You know, there\u2019s a fair amount of geopolitical things out there. China is still kind of soft overall. Russia provides a little bit of uncertainty, how\u2019s that going to play out. ", "And I think it\u2019s just a little bit too early to call exactly how calendar Q3 and Q4 are going to look, other than we think we\u2019re reasonably comfortable that it\u2019s going to be seasonally up, pretty much along the lines of what we typically see.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. ", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "One, maybe if you could just touch on the inventory side. A healthy spike in the finished goods inventory on a sequential basis. Could you talk about what\u2019s driving that given the fact that you\u2019re actually looking for a downtick in TAM in the June quarter?", "Timothy Leyden ", "So if you look at our business, and look at the cash flow, we had very good linearity during the course of the quarter. And we used that linearity in order to be able to avoid capital expenditure. Because it means that we\u2019re able to avoid spikes. So that\u2019s one thing.", "The second thing is, we\u2019re putting quite a lot of product on the ocean, and from a funding viewpoint, and from an investing viewpoint, and from a return on investment, that is proving to be a very good ROI. We did take something in the region of about $60 million in absolute terms out of the work in process, and our [raw] was almost flat. ", "So when we look at how we\u2019re executing the business, it\u2019s a mix of making sure that, as we kind of bypass an expenditure through linearity, we can then avoid costs through putting product on the ocean. And as we put it on the ocean, it means that we carry that inventory for something in the region of six to eight weeks or so. So it does have an impact on our finished goods. ", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets ", "And then a second question, I guess when I look at the total exabytes shipped on a capacity basis, it looks like that number is about 10% both year over year and also on a rolling four quarter basis. That seems to be below kind of what the expectation is, at least I would have had on that number. So how do we think about that as we go into the back half, especially when you\u2019re expecting this enterprise pick up. Does it remain here? Or do you think it gets back to this 20% to 30% range.", "Stephen Milligan ", "So there\u2019s a few things that are impacting that. The first thing that I think is important is that overall growth in data, which is a little bit difficult to get exact numbers on it, but [unintelligible] the analysis that we\u2019ve got is tracking to our expectations. So it\u2019s not an issue, the exabyte growth issue is not reflective of overall content creation, if you want to call it that.", "The other thing is that some of the numbers that we have been talking about historically, let\u2019s call it a 25% growth, rounding off to 25% growth, in exabyte volumes. That had certain assumptions related to the PC market, both from a volume perspective as well as from a capacity mix perspective. ", "What we\u2019re seeing is one, volumes have generally speaking been less than what we had previously assumed. The other thing is that our PC customers are not mixing up to higher capacity points as much as we normally have seen. Really, one, because they\u2019re trying to hit certain cost points, and also, aerial density growth is not progressing as much as what we have historically seen. So that, because of the large volume that the PC market tends to have, has an oversized impact on that 25%, reconciling it back to the 10% number that you\u2019re talking about. ", "And then on the last factor that I will cite, is that some of these recent changes that we\u2019ve seen in terms of the capacity enterprise market, where we\u2019re seeing more softness than what we previously expected, because of efficiencies that they\u2019re realizing, that\u2019s also had an impact.

That\u2019s mainly what causes that.", "Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research ", "And can you talk about why you actually saw the year over year declines on the revenue and units?", "Timothy Leyden ", "I don\u2019t think that the growth numbers have been as we would have expected, and I\u2019m talking about total TAM. So consequently, we participated in that. And Toshiba has taken a bit more market share in some parts of the world, primarily through aggressive pricing. And we\u2019re selective in how we compete in there, but the market growth we expect is going to get back as the products become more compelling. What we\u2019ve done is participated selectively and tried to keep the market share that we\u2019ve had.", "Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights Research ", "Taking into account Toshiba\u2019s aggressiveness, then do you see that the TAM for branded has been expanding for the March quarter? Or was that flat, or could that still contract?", "Timothy Leyden ", "We think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity for external drive attachment as we go forward, particularly as handheld devices and other devices don\u2019t have that much storage integrated into them. So it\u2019s a changing market, but there are lots of opportunities there, and together with direct attach, NAS, and also wireless, I think there\u2019s big opportunity for us to be able to capitalize on the continuing trend towards mobility. But so far, I think it\u2019s been more anemic that we would have expected or liked it to be.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe Wittine with Longbow Research.", "Joe Wittine - Longbow Research", "I wanted to ask about gaming. How long does the cycle go? Initially, I think you\u2019d assume you get an initial uptick with the early adopters, then kind of ease. And I think at one point, we said September would be the peak, and December held up, March held up. It sounds like June will be okay. So going forward, does the cycle play out with a long runway, or can this market potentially change on a dime and see orders pulled abruptly if things slow quickly?", "Stephen Milligan ", "That\u2019s a very good question, and the reality is, I don\u2019t know the answer to that. And part of the reason I don\u2019t know the answer to that is because our customers don\u2019t know at this point. I mean, the demand has been very strong. There\u2019s a lot of bullishness there. And so we don\u2019t know exactly how long the cycle is going to go. Now, that being said, just as an example, the models will last for quite a while. It\u2019s just units will continue to be produced. It\u2019s just a matter of at what volume.", "And so we\u2019re going to have to continue to monitor that and keep you abreast of how we\u2019re seeing the gaming volumes play out. But right now, there is a fair amount of bullishness on behalf of our customers regarding the new gaming consoles.", "Joe Wittine - Longbow Research ", "And then finally, on the My Cloud, you kind of talked around this, Steve, but the service outages. Do you think you kind of nipped it in the bud quick enough where there\u2019s no near term market dynamics that shake out because of it?", "Stephen Milligan ", "We haven\u2019t seen anything regarding that. It has apparently not had any impact on our sales. That being said, we take these things very seriously, and certainly did our best to respond as quickly as we can, and have attempted to take preventative actions to minimize the risk of that happening again. But so far, knock on wood, we have not seen any direct impact on the units that we\u2019re selling.", "Thank you all for joining us, and we look forward to updating you as we go forward.

Please go ahead, sir.", "Brendan Lahiff", "Thank you, Mellany [ph], and good afternoon everyone. With me on the call are Sanjay Mehrohtra, President and CEO of SanDisk, and Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President of Administration and CFO. In a moment we will hear remarks from both of them, followed by Q&A.", "Before we begin, please note that any non-GAAP financial measures being discussed during the call, as defined by the SEC in Regulation G, will be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure.

Investors and security holders of Fusion-io are urged to read these and other documents filed with the SEC, as well as any amendments or supplements to those documents carefully in their entirety when they become available, because they contain or will contain important information about the proposed transaction.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Sanjay.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Thank you, Brendan, and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to report record second quarter revenue and net income. Our results highlight ongoing strong execution and further progress in the strategic shift of our revenue mix to SSD solutions. SSDs reached 29% of our second quarter revenue, driven by record revenue in both client and enterprise SSDs, and we are on track to exceed our 2014 revenue mix goal for our SSD solutions.", "Our enterprise SSD revenue more than doubled on a year-over-year basis and grew over 30% sequentially, driven by gains in both SaaS and SATA products. Our expanding portfolio of innovative enterprise flash solutions uniquely positions us as a preferred partner to a broad range of customers who are increasingly utilizing flash to optimize their workloads. Our CloudSpeed and other SATA SSD products are now qualified at multiple hyper-scale customers, and we are pleased with the strong traction and revenue ramp achieved in the initial phases of our engagement in this market. In SaaS SSD, we are now in production at a Tier 1 storage OEM for their all-flash array offering, using our recently introduced 2 terabytes Optimus Eco SSD.", "In the second quarter we also announced our lightning 12-gigabit SaaS SSD and 4 terabyte Optimus MAX SaaS SSD, extending our leadership in high-performance and high-density SaaS solutions. The new 4 terabyte MAX SaaS SSD has received a lot of customer interest for replacing legacy 15K and even 10K RTM hard-disk drive in mission-critical storage and data center applications. Tier 1 server and storage OEM qualifications of our new SaaS and [indiscernible] products are proceeding well, and we expect them to contribute to our revenue starting in the second half of the year.", "In June, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Fusion-io, a market leader in enterprise PCIe hardware and software solutions. This acquisition will accelerate our transformation into a value-added solutions providers and will further enhance our capabilities with new solutions, channels, customers and go-to market expertise. We have received regulatory clearance for this transaction and look forward to closing this acquisition soon, for the timeline of our tender offer.", "In client SSDs, we achieved another record quarterly revenue. Our broad portfolio of SATA and PCIe client SSD solutions continue to serve all leading PC OEMs well, and we are making excellent progress in qualifying our 1Y nanometer client SSDs at many of these OEMs.", "During the quarter we introduced the SanDisk Extreme PRO, a high-performance client SSD with up to 1 terabyte class capacity offered with the industry's first ever 10-year warranty. This product has received highly positive reviews, lauding it as the best and most consistently performing client SSD in the market. We are also preparing to commence shipments of X3-based client SSDs in the retail and distribution channels and initiate qualifications with OEM customers in the third quarter. We are excited by the increasing attach rate of SSDs to notebook computers, particularly in corporate PC platforms. Our investments in advancing our product technology, customer engagements and supply chain capabilities position us well to continue to grow our revenue in the client SSD space.", "Turning to embedded solutions, overall revenue grew slightly from the prior quarter, with solid growth in sales of custom embedded solutions and the decline in sales of iNAND, primarily stemming from some weakness at certain high-end smartphone customers and the timing of our 1Y product transitions.", "Our engagement with China-based mobile device manufacturers is progressing very well, and we are seeing solid revenue growth in this part of the market. We expanded our mobile offerings for mid and entry-level smartphones and tablets with the launch of the iNAND Standard, which is X3-based embedded offering.", "Customer qualifications of our X3-based embedded solutions are proceeding as planned, and we expect revenue ramp to begin in the third quarter of 2014, positioning us well for growth in embedded in the second half of the year.", "In retail, we delivered record second quarter revenue with a mix of high-performance, ultra and extreme products, contributing through to half of our retail revenue. Key market trends such as ultra-high definition video and high resolution imaging features in various consumer devices also fuel a greater need for high-performance, high-capacity removable storage solutions. This plays to our retail strength, including our valuable brand, excellent performance-based product segmentation and broad global reach. We are well-positioned for strong performance in retail for the upcoming back-to-school and end-of-the-year holiday period.", "In terms of fab output in the second quarter, the mix of our 1Y technology was approximately 60% of our total bit output. And we expect to remain at approximately this level for the remainder of 2014.", "We continue to have strong demands from our OEM customers for the 19-nanometer technology nodes and we are committed to supporting the long tail of demand for products based on this technology. As we are becoming more successful in OEM and enterprise accounts, this trend of longer product lifecycles on older technology generations is becoming more pronounced as customers rely on us for supply continuity. We expect approximately 5% wafer capacity growth in 2014, and given OEM and enterprise demand for 19-nanometer supply, we expect our supply bit growth to be at the lower end of our previously stated range of 25% to 35%. Our estimate of industry supply bit growth remains at approximately 40%.", "We project healthy industry demand supply environment for the remainder of the year. Specifically for SanDisk, we expect to be somewhat supply-constrained during the second half of the year and expect to manage our revenue mix with focus on our strategic priorities and customer relationships.", "As we have discussed previously, we will begin installation and qualification of equipment for technology transition in phase two of Fab 5 in the third quarter of 2014. We continue to make very good progress with our 15-nanometer technology development and we expect to begin the production ramp toward the end of this year, with meaningful contribution to product shipments in the Q1 2015 timeframe. Our 3D NAND technology development continues to make good progress, and we expect to be in pilot production in the second half of 2015, with target production in 2016.", "To conclude, the second quarter marked another period of significant achievements and developments, putting us on an excellent path to deliver yet another year of record results. The long-term demand drivers remain healthy and SanDisk is increasingly becoming an important partner to our customers as we make progress in delivering a broad array of high-value storage solutions.", "We look forward to welcoming the Fusion-io team to the SanDisk family, and we remain focused on delivering the best value to our customers, partners, employees and shareholders.", "With that, I will turn over the call to Judy for the financial review and outlook.", "Judy Bruner", "Thank you, Sanjay. We are pleased with our Q2 year-over-year growth of 11% in revenue and 16% in non-GAAP earnings per share. Our revenue of $1.63 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $1.41 both represent second quarter records. Our year-over-year revenue growth was 14% in the commercial channel and 4% in the retail channel, resulting in a Q2 mix of 67% commercial and 33% retail.", "By product category, the strongest revenue growth was in the SSD solutions which grew 97% year over year and 9% sequentially, reaching 29% of our revenue mix and setting new record levels for both client and enterprise SSD revenue.", "Our removable product revenue grew 7% both year over year and sequentially, representing 40% of our Q2 revenue. Within removable products, our strongest growth was in micro SD cards, particularly within emerging markets.", "Our embedded revenue was down year over year by 29% and up sequentially by 3%, representing 19% of our total Q2 revenue. Sequentially, our sales of custom embedded solutions increased while sales of iNAND and MCP iNAND products were down due to weakness in sales of certain smartphones and due to the in-progress qualification of our 1Y embedded products with several customers. On a year-over-year basis, the largest decline in embedded revenue resulted from lower custom embedded sales as a large customer shifted demand toward our client SSD solutions.", "Within our total revenue, memory petabytes sold increased 31% sequentially and 51% year over year, which was more than the growth in our bit supply, thus reducing inventory.", "Our Q2 non-GAAP gross margin was 48%, down 3 points from Q1 as expected, due primarily to an increased mix of custom embedded solutions. The product mix of our sales impacted our blended price per gigabyte and cost per gigabyte, causing the movement in both statistics to be higher than the underlying like-for-like trends. For Q2, our blended price per gigabyte decline was 16% and our blended cost per gigabyte decline was 12%, whereas on a like-for-like basis both numbers were single-digit declines.", "The key factors related to product mix that influenced the blended price and cost declines were a higher mix of custom embedded solutions, a lower mix of MCP products, and a higher mix of removable and other sales in emerging markets relative to established markets. The yen rate in Q2 cost of sales was 101 compared to 99 in the first quarter.", "Our Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses of $311 million were slightly below our forecasted range, due primarily to a delay in certain hiring and other spending, some of which we consciously slowed down given the planned acquisition of Fusion-io. Our Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 29% and our non-GAAP tax rate remained at 31.5%.", "Our diluted non-GAAP share count increased by 3.3 million shares, even with strong share repurchases, as our Q2 average stock price resulted in our 2017 warrants, adding an incremental 3.6 million to diluted shares.", "Our Q2 cash flow from operations was $241 million and cash used for capital investments was $44 million, yielding free cash flow of $197 million. During Q2, our capital return to shareholders totaled $302 million, comprised of $51 million of dividends and $251 million of share buybacks. During Q2 we repurchased 2.7 million shares at an average price of $92.69 per share. On a year-to-date basis, total capital return has been 81% of free cash flow and we have repurchased 4 million shares at an average price of $85.66. Our goal remains to return 100% of 2014 free cash flow to investors through the combination of dividends and stock repurchases.", "Our share of joint venture Fab Investments during Q2 was $221 million, and these purchases were funded by joint venture working capital and $64 million of new operating leases. Our off-balance-sheet equipment lease guarantees now stand at $586 million.", "I will now turn to forward-looking commentary. We currently expect the Fusion-io acquisition to close in the third quarter, but at this time we will provide our forecast on a standalone basis, with a focus on Q3. For our third quarter we expect the strongest sequential growth to come from our embedded products, including both iNAND and custom embedded solutions. We expect that we will be supply-constrained as we work to complete our modest 2014 capacity expansion and that the industry will be in supply/demand balance.", "Our third quarter revenue forecast is $1,675,000,000 to $1,725,000,000. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to remain similar to the second quarter, with the forecasted range of 47% to 49%. And given our supply constraints as well as expected product mix, we expect our third quarter blended price and cost movements to be muted in comparison to the second quarter. We forecast Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses to be $320 million to $330 million. Q3 non-GAAP other income is forecasted at $5 million, and we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 31.5%.", "In terms of diluted shares, our projection is that the Q3 non-GAAP share count will remain approximately flat to the Q2 level, with share repurchases offsetting new issuances as well as the increasing impact of the 2017 warrant. Note that a schedule is posted on our website showing the impact of the warrants at varying stock prices. And keep in mind that for any given quarter, the impact of the warrants is based on the weighted average stock price for that quarter. For example, the relevant stock price in Q2 was $90.41.", "In terms of capital investments, we continue to expect our gross investment for fab equipment and other CapEx to be approximately $1.4 billion in 2014, with cash usage of approximately $600 million, concentrated in the second half of the year given the timing of investments. For the first half of the year, our total gross investment was $540 million, with cash usage of $79 million. And while we expect to use more cash for capital investments in the second half, we also expect higher cash flow from operations in the second half of the year.", "As previously indicated, we expect the Fusion-io acquisition to close in our third fiscal quarter. As you can see from their recent quarterly results, Fusion-io has been operating at a loss, and we expect synergies to be modest in the early quarters, with any initial synergies more than offset by one-time restructuring and deal costs. We continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive to our non-GAAP earnings in the second half of our fiscal 2015.", "In summary, we are very pleased with our second quarter results. We are growing our revenue with impressive gains in SSD solutions and we are managing our overall product mix and investments to deliver strong profitability, with Q2 achieving a record in net income and EPS. At the same time, we continue to return significant capital to our shareholders. We look forward to delivering a strong second half and another record year.", "We'll now open the call for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]", "We will take our first question from Steven Chin with UBS.", "Steven Chin \u2013 UBS", "Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First thing is on your SSD business. Just get on some of the improvement sentiment on PC demand and just given the recent growth in your SSD business, I was wondering if you are seeing any further acceleration in SSD demand going to the second half and potentially next year, or if you see things sort of holding steady in terms of the penetration rates and whatnot just given what you're hearing from your customers?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We certainly do see our SSDs, in client SSDs, to continue to increase in revenue throughout the year. And we continue to see increases in penetration rate as well, both on the consumer PC side as well as on the corporate PC platform. In fact, on the corporate PC platform, we expect that SSD attach rate will be approximately 30% for 2014 and expecting it to increase to about 60% by 2017 timeframe.", "So this attach rate actually, you know, every time you look at this report, this continues to go up. SSD adoption is certainly increasing. And certainly the value proposition of SSD in terms of providing small sleek form factors, you know, with the chrome books, the two-in-one devices, the ultra-thin notebooks, as well as the SSD's value proposition in terms of instant-on capabilities and fast boot-up and high-speed applications, this is all really continuing to drive increasing penetration of SSD. And with our strong portfolio of SATA and PCIe solutions for the PC platform, we definitely continue to see strong advances in our SSD business through this year and continuing next year as well. And of course in enterprise SSD side, as you know, we are growing very nicely as well.", "Steven Chin \u2013 UBS", "Perfect. And just my follow-up is, in terms of the solid state drive controller merchant silicon market, just given some of the consolidation that's going on there with Seagate taking up some assets, and just kind of wondering if you anticipate more competition in the marketplace from them in enterprise in particular. And secondly, just from a bond class perspective, just knowing that merchant silicon from - in SSD/SSE standpoint, that is still relatively stable or at a premium in some cases. I was wondering if you see any impact longer term to SanDisk merchant controller strategy there. Thank you.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Overall in terms of enterprise SSD, really vertical integration is the key for leadership in enterprise space. And as we have seen in the client SSD space, there has been tremendous consolidation in terms of some of the players that were not vertically integrated are not around frankly anymore. So vertical integration is absolutely going to be key in enterprise SSDs as well. Having large volume production capability of flash, high-quality flash, leading-edge technology node, and applying the devices [ph] aspects of that to the controller and the firmware aspects to manage high reliability, high-performance requirements of enterprise workloads, and doing it all really in a very seamless fashion across all aspects of product development and test and understanding of customer applications is key to winning in the enterprise SSD space. So we feel really very good about our continuing position there and continuing advances in this area.", "And remember, the key, when it comes to controllers, even if our products use some third-party ESF [ph], in terms of controller, the key really comes, in terms of differentiation, comes from the firmware that is built into the products. And that firmware is built upon many years of experience of flash memory technology, device and system management, data management technique for the flash.", "So in terms of controller strategy and in terms of product strategy, we are very well-positioned to continue to do very well in the enterprise storage space.", "Steven Chin \u2013 UBS", "Great. Thank you, Sanjay.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company.", "Timothy Arcuri \u2013 Cowen & Co.", "Thanks so much. Sanjay, can you talk a little bit about the royalty profile as the industry moves from planar to 3D? Is it going to impact your royalty stream? It seems like the industry is a little less reliant on your IP at 3D, but I'm not sure if that's right.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "As we have said before, our, you know, royalty agreement with our largest licensee provides us royalties on their sales of 2D NAND as well as 3D NAND. In addition, there are certain 3D-specific backend claims that have not been licensed, which means opportunity -- additional opportunity for us in the future. SanDisk has a strong IP position both for 2D memory technology as well as for 3D memory, and our innovation pipeline continues to be strong at the memory level as well as at the system implementation level also.", "Timothy Arcuri \u2013 Cowen & Co.", "Great. Thank you for that. And then Judy, you've been talking about cost reduction targets this year, down 15% to 25% this year. Can you maybe guide us a little bit within that range? It seems like the 1Y mix is sort of flattening off here through the end of the year. So can you guide us within that range? Thanks.", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. We do expect to be in that range for this year. And at this point I would tell you that most likely we would be around the middle to somewhat higher than the middle of that range.", "We've had strong blended cost per gigabyte reduction in the first half of the year on a year-over-year basis, but I think it will be somewhat subdued in the second half of the year given that we will be holding our 1Y mix versus 19-nanometer mix approximately constant across the second half of the year. But overall, cost reduction is in the range that we had anticipated.", "Timothy Arcuri \u2013 Cowen & Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Steven Fox with Cross Research.", "Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research", "Thanks. Good afternoon. Two questions from me. First of all, just on the gross margins going forward. I think you went through the mix impact to the gross margins. But if you were to look at the like-for-like gross margin impact by products, is there any major changes over the next couple of quarters from where the gross margins are on some of the specific products like SSDs, et cetera?", "And then secondly, if you look at your own supply constraints for the rest of 2014, can you give us some kind of hint as to where you think you will be more acute in your product sales, where we'll see it most? Thank you.", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. So in terms of the mix impact on our gross margin as we move forward, the -- as I indicated, we expect the highest amount of revenue growth in the third quarter to come from our embedded products. And as we've said in the past, embedded products as well as client SSD products tend to have gross margins that are somewhat below the corporate average. So that growth in embedded would be somewhat of a headwind to the gross margin going forward.", "On the other hand, at the same time, we expect to see gross margin improvements in various parts of the business and in various products. Some of these will come from an increasing usage of captive memory within our enterprise SSD products, and also we expect, as Sanjay indicated, to utilize a higher mix of X3 in several of our products in the second half of the year. So those will be tailwinds and help our gross margins.", "But overall in terms of our gross margins, we're anticipating gross margins to remain in a similar range to the second quarter, in the range of 47% to 49%, which is a very strong gross margin and solidly within our target financial model, producing a very strong operating margin for the business.", "The second part of your question was about supply constraint --", "Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research", "Yes, where you would probably see it the most in your sales mix.", "Judy Bruner", "You know, clearly we work very hard to manage the mix of our business to meet the demand of our strategic customers and to balance the supply mix that we have of the various nodes of memory with the demand that is out there. And so we've been very successful at that, we'll continue to do that. And if there are areas that we need to pull back on, they will tend to be those areas that are less strategic to us going forward.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "And certainly profitability considerations will be one of the key factors in helping us manage, and customer relationship.", "Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.", "Ambrish Srivastava \u2013 BMO Capital", "Thank you very much. Judy and Sanjay, just a question on -- just trying to understand the supply constraint situation. How does that improve as you come on to the year?", "Judy Bruner", "Well, as we indicated, we are working on the capacity expansion that we had planned for this year, both expansion in terms of capacity -- wafer capacity and some productivity improvement that will add to wafer capacity. And that will add about 5% to our wafer capacity this year. We're working on it now and we expect that it will begin to contribute to our revenue supply in the fourth quarter of this year.", "At the same time, we are evaluating potential for additional capacity add next year. This is really very similar to what we communicated at our Investor Day. And we expect that our bit supply growth next year will be in line with industry bit supply growth in the range of 30% to 40%.", "Ambrish Srivastava \u2013 BMO Capital", "So the reason you're in this situation is because bit growth was slightly better than what you were anticipating in the first half of the year, is that the right way to think about it?", "Judy Bruner", "Well, I would say that our bit supply growth this year continues to be in the range that we talked about at the beginning of the year, the 25% to 35% range. Perhaps more towards the lower end and largely influenced by the fact that demand is coming for the 19-nanometer node, and so we are meeting that demand and thereby slowing down the transition to 1Y in order to have enough 19-nanometer to meet the needs of our strategic customers.", "Ambrish Srivastava \u2013 BMO Capital", "Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We'll go next to C.J. Muse with ISI Group.", "C.J. Muse \u2013 ISI Group", "Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, curious how you balance your desire to focus on high-cost bits with strategic relationships that demand lower-cost bits in an environment where your capacity adds are coming below industry levels. Would love to hear your thoughts on that and how to think about ASPs prospectively from here.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We basically look at long-term relationships with our customers, and certainly SanDisk has a diversified -- having the most complete portfolio of solutions offerings in the flash industry and I believe the broadest engagement of customer relationships as well. It gives us tremendous opportunity to manage the mix of our business, keeping in mind our top line and bottom line revenue and profit objectives in mind, and that's how we really focus on managing the mix of the business. And again our strategy is to focus on the best combination of revenue, profits and cash flow. And we feel really pleased with the progress that we have made over the course of last few years in diversifying our product portfolio, deepening our customer engagements, broadening the customer engagements. And that just gives us opportunity to manage our mix very effectively.", "C.J. Muse \u2013 ISI Group", "That's helpful. And if I could just ask two clarifications. First, in terms of bit growth next year, up 30% to 40%, does that include additional wafer starts or that's the base case? And then secondly, on the royalty side, can you share whether the rate is the same for 2D and 3D? Thank you.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We are not going to provide specifics on royalty rates for 2D or 3D, although royalty rates are same between the two. Regarding the wafer capacity growth of 30% to 40% for next year, that does include our assumptions for any capacity adds during the year.", "C.J. Muse \u2013 ISI Group", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Doug Friedman with RBC Capital Markets.", "Doug Friedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Great. Thanks for taking my question. If you could talk maybe a little bit about struggling with the bit growth numbers that you've communicated being towards the low end on the supply side. Those are talking about just the amount of bits that you're producing. How about the amount of bits that are available for you to ship from inventory, how much higher can that number be on a shipment basis from the work-down of your internal inventories?", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. We believe that from a revenue perspective we can have a higher growth rate in revenue bits than in supply bits this year. And I would say that the revenue bit growth rate can be more towards the upper end of that range, whereas the supply bits growth more towards the lower end of that range.", "And as you saw in our results this quarter, we did bring inventory down. I think we can continue to bring inventory down over the course of the second half of this year, and we expect to do so in order to maximize available petabytes to meet demand.", "Doug Friedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. I'm also struggling on that bit growth guidance because you did guide wafers to increase I believe about 5%, and we should see a rather material increase in X3. How does X3 play, what percentage of the bit growth is being driven by maybe the X3 conversion? And maybe if you could offer a little bit of a commentary on whether the conditions in the marketplace have changed at all that is contributing to sort of the ASP erosion that you just reported.", "Judy Bruner", "So in terms of the breakdown of the supply bit growth, we're not going to break it down into all the different pieces. But the lower end of that 25% to 35% range includes growth that's coming from the 1Y transition which we essentially now are not going to transition anymore percentage to 1Y in the second half of the year. And it's coming from an increasing mix of X3, you're right. And in fact, our X3 mix increased in the second quarter relative to the first quarter and we expect it will increase in the second half, and is coming from the 5% increase in wafer capacity. But keep in mind that that wafer capacity is really only starting to contribute in the latter part of the year.", "So you have to keep in mind, we had 1Y conversion impacting the first half of the year and not the second half. Then we have wafer capacity starting to impact later in the year but not earlier in the year. And we do have X3 increasing across the year in terms of mix.", "And I'm sorry, Doug, what was the second part of your question again?", "Doug Friedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Just trying to get a sense if you're seeing any change in maybe the marketplace or pricing, the market environment, that is driving the results that you're seeing, most notably sort of the ASP change, even on a like-for-like 12% down in a constrained environment is maybe a little surprising for some.", "Judy Bruner", "Yeah. So as I indicated, on a like-for-like basis, both our price decline and our cost decline were single-digit numbers relative to the first quarter. But I would tell you that on a like-for-like basis the price decline was somewhat higher than the cost decline. And we did see some pockets of softness in terms of pricing in the second quarter. However, we have seen in recent weeks that pricing firm up and it appears to be moving in the right direction. That combined with our own expectation of supply constraint in the third quarter and we believe a healthier environment across the second half in terms of seasonality and demand, lead us to believe that pricing is going to be very muted in the third quarter.", "And so, you know, also keep in mind that as you look at some of these price statistics as well as cost statistics, mix is increasingly influencing those statistics, and any one of them in isolation is really not a good measure of the health of the business. And so I really encourage you to look at our gross margin and our operating margin, both of which I think are leaders in terms of profitability in the industry. And we have worked very hard to diversify our product portfolio and our customer portfolio and manage that mix of products every quarter in order to grow the revenue and produce very strong profitability.", "Doug Friedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Great. Thank you. I'll leave it there and get back in the queue if there's time.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee.", "Vijay Rakesh \u2013 Sterne Agee", "Yeah, hi guys. You mentioned, you know, as you look at second half, you are keeping the 19-nanometer mix constant. How do you see the 15-nanometer ramping, you know, 1Z ramping next year? Where are you with TLC in the mix today?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "With respect to TLC in the mix, in the second quarter it was, you know, 45% to 50% range. And as we have said, in the second half we expect X3 percentage to go higher somewhat. And regarding 1Z nodes, it will be starting production ramp late in the fourth quarter, late this year. And we expect it to be really primarily becoming meaningful starting first quarter in terms of bit mix.", "Vijay Rakesh \u2013 Sterne Agee", "Got it. And when you look at TLC, what portion of your SSDs, obviously SSD is growing faster, what portion of your SSD is on 3-bit today, or when do you expect that to become meaningful?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So as we said, in terms of X3 SSD, we'll be launching it in -- shipping it in retail and commercial channels in the third quarter, the SSD built on 3-bit per cell technology. And we will also be in customer qualifications -- OEM qualifications with that X3 SSD. We expect X3 SSD to start to become more meaningful for us and ramping up nicely in 2015 timeframe.", "Vijay Rakesh \u2013 Sterne Agee", "Got it. Thanks.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Craig Ellis with B. Riley.", "Craig Ellis \u2013 B. Riley", "Thanks for taking the questions. Judy, I'm sorry if I missed it. Could you please give us an update on the cash CapEx expectation for the full year of calendar 2014?", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. I said that I expect the cash CapEx for the full year to be approximately $600 million. We've only spent $79 million in the first half of the year, so it's concentrated in the second half of the year. However, at the same time, I expect our cash flow from operations to be stronger in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year.", "Craig Ellis \u2013 B. Riley", "And at Analyst Day you indicated I think that around $400 million of this year's CapEx was for non-wafer-fab, and one of the initiatives was to build your own SSD manufacturing facility in Malaysia. Given the pending Fusion-io acquisition, what's the expectation for the capital intensity of that facility? Does it need to go up given what you may do with that new business?", "Judy Bruner", "That facility is under construction. We broke ground and it's under construction, and we absolutely are moving as fast as we can on the construction of that Malaysia SSD facility.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "And we expect it to be in production in second half of next year.", "Craig Ellis \u2013 B. Riley", "And would it be -- would it be something you could use for Fusion-io product?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We will discuss these post-close, once we firm up our plans.", "Craig Ellis \u2013 B. Riley", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.", "Mehdi Hosseini \u2013 SIG", "Thanks for taking my question. Judy, what will be -- what would have been your guide if you were not bit capacity constrained?", "Judy Bruner", "You know, I'm not going to provide that number. We have given guidance for revenue growth on both a sequential and year-over-year basis and continuing to execute very well to our plans for this year with very strong profitability. And so we're very happy with how we're executing for this year. And as Sanjay has said, we expect this to be another record year.", "Mehdi Hosseini \u2013 SIG", "Sure, fair. And Sanjay, as we look into next year bit supply growth of 30% to 40%, how should we think about how the Fusion-io is going to consume some of these bits of capacity? And would that have any change on your capacity plan or would you prefer going into the merchant market and just procure from merchant market if you have to? If you remain capacity constrained?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Well, I'm sorry, maybe I didn't let you finish the question. Please say the last sentence again?", "Mehdi Hosseini \u2013 SIG", "Sure. Given the expectation of Fusion-io closing in the September quarter and there the capacity requirement for Fusion-io products, is that changing your capacity planning? And B, if not, would you be willing to procure more from the merchant market?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So regarding the flash memory supply requirements for Fusion-io, as we have seen from our previous acquisitions of Pliant, as well as SmartStorage, it takes several quarters before volume ramp of captive memory supply can really begin in enterprise storage space. So we expect the Fusion-io flash memory requirements to be met for next few quarters from non-captive memory sources. And it will take few quarters before we can start converting it to captive memory based on the timing of the customer qualifications. And besides that, we will be continuing to assess for opportunities to use for part of the portfolio of Fusion-io products requirement non-captive memory.", "So we'll have a strategy of converting towards captive memory over the course of few quarters, as well as continuing to leverage non-captive memory for part of that business as well.", "Mehdi Hosseini \u2013 SIG", "Okay. And what was the mix of TLC in the quarter?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "As I said, in the range of 45% to 50%.", "Mehdi Hosseini \u2013 SIG", "Thanks much.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.", "John Pitzer \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Yes, thanks guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Judy, I'm sorry if I missed this, but given the builds on the handset side this quarter expected from some of your customers, would you expect the embedded mix to kind of peak in the September quarter and go down in the December quarter? And if so, what would the margin kind of consequence be of that? Or can you help me understand that dynamic?", "Judy Bruner", "We do expect very strong growth in the embedded business in the third quarter, both because of seasonality, as you indicate, as well as due to completing our qualifications of our 1Y iNAND product. So, very strong growth in the third quarter. It's possible that that could ease some in the fourth quarter due to seasonality and in particular as we service our retail channel in the fourth quarter.", "But in terms of gross margin, at this point we would anticipate that gross margin would remain in the 47% to 49% range for the second half.", "John Pitzer \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Got it. And then, Sanjay, you answered a question earlier about kind of the parameters around what makes a customer strategic, and I know there's a lot of other puts and takes on that. But I'm kind of curious, how much margin would you be willing to give up to support a strategic customer? Or I guess another way of saying it, at what point would mixing away from a strategic customer be so much more profitable that it would start to make sense for you?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "I think if you look at over the course of last few years, I mean we are really continuing -- continue to increase the mix of our solutions toward embedded and SSDs, and we are really doing a very good job in managing that mix I believe.", "And in terms of the strategic nature of the customer, the factors that we look at are the long-term stickiness of the business, you know, our relationship with that customer in terms of us being able to deliver value to that customer. We certainly keep in mind the revenue opportunities when we look at the strategic nature of the customers, as well as the profitability consideration. So there are lots of moving parts, when we look at the mix of the business, our customer base really has broadened significantly over the course of last few years. And again, as I said before, I really feel good about having the opportunity to manage this mix on an ongoing basis, with the focus on delivering the top-line growth and delivering strong profits, the net income.", "So I really believe that our customer relationship, our technology and product positioning across the broad spectrum of industry applications for flash and our ability to serve the customers as well really performing very well for us.", "John Pitzer \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company.", "Rajvindra Gill \u2013 Needham & Co.", "Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the competitive landscape of the SSD space given some of the recent consolidation, and how do you approach the market in terms of your strategy? Thank you.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "In terms of strategy for SSD, I mean I'll just comment on client as well as on enterprise. You know, our strategy certainly is to bring leading-edge products, you know, high-performance products with high quality, high support to the customers in terms of supply availability, as well as really making sure that our products really enhance the experience of the customers and devices in the marketplace. So our strategy to our relationship with the customer through bringing value of our technology and products and supply is -- are the key things that we focus on in terms of growing our business.", "As you have seen on the client SSD space, we have expanded our solutions offering not only in SATA but on the side of PCIe as well.", "And in terms of competition, certainly over the course of last many quarters, SanDisk has really strengthened its market share position. We really are a strong number two player in client SSD market. So we have continued to gain share through our technology, products, supply and quality capabilities.", "On the enterprise side, we have focused very much on this as a strategic growth vector for the company, with strong portfolio of solutions, a broad range of solutions, some of which I talked about in my prepared remarks, adjusting both the high-performance as well as the high capacity, and really looking at customer applications, looking at the workloads and bringing solutions, both hardware and software, in terms of accelerating the value proposition of flash and making their application -- customer's applications and services become more resilient and more responsive. And this strategy is working very well for us and we are gaining share in enterprise SSD space as well. And now with the acquisition of Fusion-io, we will instantly [ph] become a leader in the market in PCIe space as well.", "So, SanDisk truly is a one-stop shop for entire set of flash storage solutions, and certainly that includes client and the enterprise SSDs. And in all of this, as we have said many times before, vertical integration is the key.", "Rajvindra Gill \u2013 Needham & Co.", "And can you just talk a little bit about the adoption rate of your MCP or just in general the adoption of the trend more to multi-chip package solution in the smartphone industry where OEMs are using both NAND and DRAM?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "In the low-end smartphones, certainly multi-chip packages have grown nicely, and certainly SanDisk, we very strategically offer our multi-chip packages that bring in the value of our iNAND solutions, as well as provide the benefit that customers are looking for of flash, iNAND and DRAM in one package.", "For the midrange to high-end-range phones, certainly discrete iNAND is primarily the solution in terms of its presence in the marketplace. So there is a strong mix of both multi-chip packages as well as discrete iNAND. Our focus is in providing our customers with their requirements. iNAND -- discrete iNAND is a bigger part of our business. But certainly as you've heard from us before, multi-chip packages have also been substantial offerings from SanDisk for our customers. So we are very pleased with the mix that we are able to provide to our customers in embedded with discrete iNAND, with multi-chip iNAND, as well as with customized solutions. And really there's a broad range of applications of all of these solutions in the marketplace.", "Rajvindra Gill \u2013 Needham & Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities.", "Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Judy, you kind of didn't provide a yearly guidance, I'm assuming it's because of the Fusion-io kind of close in September, if on the standalone basis could you kind of provide your yearly guidance?", "Judy Bruner", "You know, you're right, we are not providing a specific quarter four guidance at this point because we will be providing that on a combined basis in October with the Fusion-io business. But I did indicate just a few minutes ago that we do expect the 47% to 49% gross margin range to apply for the second half. And as is typical, we would expect revenue growth from the third quarter to the fourth quarter in terms of seasonality and in terms of growing demand and placement of our products.", "But beyond that, I think it makes sense to give specifics in October on a combined business basis.", "Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "Thanks a lot. Then just as a follow-up, could you maybe talk about some of the products of Fusion-io like ioControl, ioTurbine? Would, you know, after the merger, would you still like to continue reporting that product or you may think to kind of discontinue them?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Specifically with respect to Fusion-io product roadmap, we will provide you updates after the close in our future quarterly updates.", "Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.", "Mark Delaney \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thanks so much for taking the question. I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on the enterprise SSD business and if you can talk to us about the range of margins and how they differ between the SaaS and SATA and ULLtraDIMM products, and if all of those are above the corporate average or just some of those types of enterprise SSDs are above the corporate average for margins?", "Judy Bruner", "Okay. So in terms of the enterprise business, yes, it definitely has a gross margin above the corporate average, when it's using captive memory. And within the enterprise business, I think it's pretty well-understood that SaaS type of products tend to have higher gross margins than SATA products. And of course at this point really ULLtraDIMM is not a part of the revenue equation yet but we are clearly working on that and expect that it will become in the future and that it will have strong gross margins.", "Mark Delaney \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "That's helpful. And the follow-up, on the same topic, Judy, as you -- if you can just talk a little bit more about the mix that you saw this quarter between SATA and SaaS and then what the expectations are for that mix and the organic business as you move through the rest of the year?", "Judy Bruner", "Both the SATA and the SaaS products grew nicely this quarter, but we're not going to break down the business to that degree.", "Mark Delaney \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thank you very much.", "Brendan Lahiff", "We have time for one more question.", "Operator", "We will take our last question from Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.", "Hans Mosesmann \u2013 Raymond James", "Thanks for fitting me in. Most of my questions have been answered, but I'm curious, Sanjay, if you have any comments regarding a competitor's SSD based on the third-generation vNAND or second-generation? It looks like it has gotten pretty good reviews in terms of endurance. What is the -- what's your view on that and what does that do with the competitive dynamic over the next year? Thanks.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "In terms of performance, our Extreme PRO SSDs that we announced recently really have got tremendous reviews in the marketplace, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, in terms of performance and really consistent performance. So we have a strong portfolio of products for our SSDs here.", "And regarding the 3D announcements that are out there in the marketplace, we have always talked about in the past that the first few generations of 3D NAND will not really be cost-competitive with the 2D NAND. So I feel really very good about our technology roadmap, with our 1Y production this year, 1Z production this year, 1Z production next year, giving us strong cost leadership with 2D or with any of the 3D NAND technology. And then in 2016 timeframe, to have our 3D NAND.", "And using these technologies, we really have a very strong portfolio of SSD offerings to compete with anyone in the marketplace. And ultimately all this demonstrates in the results that we have in terms of the growth of the business and share gains with SSDs.", "Hans Mosesmann \u2013 Raymond James", "Great. Thank you.", "Brendan Lahiff", "Thanks everyone. We'd like to thank everyone for joining our call today.", "A webcast replay of today's call should be available on our Investor Relations website shortly.", "Thank you and have a good evening.", "Operator", "Once again this does conclude the conference.

Welcome to Western Digital's Fourth Quarter Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2014. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.", "Robert Blair", "Thank you. I want to mention at the outset that we will be making forward-looking statements in both our comments and in response to your questions, concerning, among others, our position in the growth of data and the storage ecosystem; the growth areas in storage; our investment focus; our product offerings and our customers' responses to our product offerings; and our financial performance, including our financial results expectations for the September quarter.

Milligan", "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, Tim Leyden will provide additional commentary on our June quarter performance and our outlook for the September quarter.", "Western Digital achieved strong financial results in the June quarter, with better-than-anticipated revenue, healthy gross margin performance and continued strong cash flow generation. We achieved these results by addressing continued robust demand in gaming and better-than-anticipated demand in notebook PCs, demonstrating our flexibility and capability in high-volume businesses. We also saw strength in our performance enterprise business. We anticipate better demand in the second half of the calendar year as we benefit from an improving demand profile for PCs, as well as from growth in the capacity enterprise space. Our recent dialog with leading PC makers has been uniformly positive, and we are also encouraged by our ongoing interactions with data center customers.", "Longer term, we remain excited about Western Digital's strong strategic position at the center of the storage ecosystem, which continues to expand, evolve and transform. The creation of digital data continues unabated, and the strategic value of that content is increasing. With our deep insight and experience, we will continue to play a vital role in unlocking the value of data with innovative and industry-leading storage devices and solutions.", "We will continue to focus our investments in the highest growth areas: the public cloud and enterprise data centers, mobility and the personal cloud. Along those lines, I am pleased to note several recent achievements by our HGST and WD subsidiaries, including the expansion of our industry-leading Enterprise SAS SSD portfolio with our next-generation Ultrastar drives with capacities up to 1.6 terabytes; a new converged enterprise PCIe product roadmap following the integration of our sTec, Virident and VeloBit acquisitions; shipment of our next-generation 10K and 15K 2.5-inch performance enterprise hard drives; shipment of our third-generation WD Red product at 6 terabytes to address continued strong demand in the home and small business mass space; continued global success of our WD Purple drives in addressing the high-growth demand for security surveillance in homes and offices; and the introduction of My Book Live Duo, the newest member of our award-winning line of desktop storage solutions for the home and office, with software that provides secure local cloud and system-level backups for complete data protection. Collectively, these developments highlight our broad-based participation in the growth of data. Combined with our ongoing investments, I'm confident of Western Digital's future as a leading technology company and storage solution provider.", "Tim?", "Timothy M. Leyden", "Thank you, Steve. Strong demand and consistent execution helped us exceed financial expectations in the June quarter. Continued strength in the gaming space, better-than-expected demand in notebook PCs and strength in performance enterprise countered the anticipated softness in capacity enterprise. Revenue for fiscal year 2014 was $15.1 billion, including $509 million from Enterprise SSD, which represented a 43% increase from fiscal year 2013. We continued to make progress on our journey towards a more diversified revenue mix, with 53% of our revenue coming from our branded consumer electronics and Enterprise HDD and SSD businesses.", "Our revenue for the June quarter was $3.7 billion, including $113 million from Enterprise SSDs. Over the long term, we continue to expect that our SSD revenue growth will outpace the growth rate of the total Enterprise SSD space. We shipped a total of 63.1 million hard drives at an average selling price of $56. The quarter-over-quarter decline in overall ASP was driven by business mix, consistent with the robust gaming and better-than-expected notebook volumes. Our gross margin for the quarter was 28.2%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 29.5%, in line with our implied guidance and excluding $39 million of amortization expense for acquired intangible assets, as well as $10 million of other charges. Our net income for the June quarter totaled $317 million or $1.32 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $445 million or $1.85 per share.", "Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $713 million in cash from operations in the June quarter, and our free cash flow totaled $552 million. For fiscal year 2014, we generated $2.8 billion in cash from operations, and our free cash flow totaled $2.2 billion. Our CapEx for the June quarter totaled $161 million or 4% of revenue. For the full fiscal year, our CapEx totaled $628 million, again, 4% of revenue. We expect that CapEx for the 2015 fiscal year will be at or below the low end of our 5% to 7% model.", "We repurchased 3.2 million shares for $272 million during the June quarter. For fiscal year 2014, we repurchased 10.3 million shares for $816 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.40 per share. In total, we paid dividends of $259 million during fiscal year 2014.", "We exited Q4 with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.8 billion, of which approximately $1.4 billion was in the U.S.", "I will now provide our guidance for the September quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.8 billion to $3.9 billion; gross margin marginally above the midpoint of our 27% to 32% model, excluding the amortization of intangibles; R&D and SG&A spending of around $625 million, excluding the amortization of intangibles; the 14th week adds about $28 million of OpEx; a tax rate of approximately 8.5%; and a share count of approximately 241 million.", "Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.95 and $2.05 for the September quarter. As a reminder, we expect the sTec, VeloBit and Virident acquisitions to be accretive early in calendar year 2015. In closing, I want to remind investors and analysts that our fiscal year 2015 would consist of 53 weeks, with the first quarter ending October 3, 2014, consisting of 14 weeks and the second and third and fourth quarters at 13 weeks each.", "Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel.", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "So first question for me would be just as we look at the 14-week period in the current quarter, I know you talked about operating expenses. So maybe you can help us understand what's your total TAM assumption for the industry and then also, what are you assuming as far as the contribution for your shipment numbers for that extra week in the current quarter. And I do have a follow-up.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Aaron, it's Steve. We -- our TAM expectation for calendar Q3 or fiscal Q1 for us is around 145 million units, kind of in that range. And we would expect that the 14th week, when you look at it on a net basis or an operating income basis, it will be modestly positive from an earnings perspective from our standpoint.", "Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then as a follow-on, I know that -- I don't know if you're going to say much at all, but just any kind of update of where we stand as far as the refiling with MOFCOM? Any kind of clarity or any expectations or any color that you can give would be helpful there.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Sure. Just to comment on where we're at and to refresh everybody's memory, in March of this year, we were able to reapply to MOFCOM to request that they lift the whole separate restriction on our business. That application process and review process, which MOFCOM is ongoing and continues, I don't have anything specific to comment on in terms of the status other than to comment that our dialog remains frequent with them and is constructive. And in that regard, we feel good about the direction that we're headed in terms of the dialog we're having.", "Operator", "Next question is from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets Canada", "I also had 2 questions. Tim, perhaps if I could start with you though. If you could talk a little bit about the cash cycle. The DSOs were up quite a bit, and so your cash conversion cycle weakened significantly relative to past June quarters. If you could just talk a little bit about what drove that and where you see that going here in the current quarter. And then I have a follow-up please.", "Timothy M. Leyden", "Yes. I'm not sure that we can significantly -- on a cash conversion cycle basis, it was up 1 day.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets Canada", "Yes, sorry, the DSO is what I was referring to, excuse me.", "Timothy M. Leyden", "We made some progress on inventory, particularly in [indiscernible] -- we funded finished goods a bit. As far as the DSOs are concerned, that was mainly due to customer and channel mix. As you know, in the fourth quarter, it's historically been our weakest quarter, particularly for consumer and distribution and retail. So consequently, it's mainly due to just customer mix.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets Canada", "Okay, okay. If I could ask my follow-up then. As it relates to pricing, could you talk about like-for-like pricing? And particularly, how you see how it was this quarter and how you see it unfolding in the September quarter please.", "Timothy M. Leyden", "Just a bit of background, the -- as you know, our -- the TAM was quite a bit up from where we had anticipated in our April call. And mostly, it was up in notebook and in gaming, which we've indicated historically that those are among our weakest ASPs and our weakest margins. And so pricing continues to be competitive, and there was about 60% of the delta between the 2 quarters in ASP, which was a $2 delta came from the mix and the rest of it came from price and from like-for-like pricing.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets Canada", "Okay. Well, I would assume to follow that the pricing mix would be favorable as we looked at the September quarter.", "Timothy M. Leyden", "Yes. In the September quarter, again, there's a more favorable consumer mix as we head into the holiday season. So consequently, we're expecting that it will be modestly -- there will be modestly upward momentum in the pricing in the September quarter.", "Operator", "Next question is from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Two if I could. The first one -- both bigger picture. The first one is with more hybrid drives being qualified as we head into the second half of the year, what is your thinking around '15 and '16 in the potential to maybe gain back or claw back some of the share that SSDs has gained in notebooks over the last few years? Love to get your thoughts there and then I have a follow-up.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Sure. This is Steve, I'll take that question. Relative to hybrids, first thing is, is that it remains a relatively small piece of our business or low volumes from our perspective. We began to see some encouraging signs from our perspective in terms of the acceptance or utilization of hybrid drives, albeit small, still remaining small volumes. So we should see increasing volumes as we move through the back half of the year. I think it's a little bit too early to say how much that will stem the acceptance of pure -- of SSDs in the PC space. I think it's just a little bit too early to call that. We'll have to see how some of these new products that our customers are introducing, how they are received in the end-user market.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Got it. That's very helpful, Steve. And as a follow-up, just with regard to the CapEx model and the comments, you said in fiscal '15, you plan to be below the low end of the 5% to 7%. What -- how should we think about your thinking with regards to moving back up into that model over the next handful of years, next couple of years and the timing of needing to add add on capacity, save TAM space stays flattish to slightly up? And how might you go about looking to finance the capacity add-ons?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Right now, we continue to expect that we'll stay kind of at or below that, the 5% to 7% range. The one wildcard, frankly, that we have is what happens relative to the hold separate situation. If the hold separate gets lifted, we will then be able to rationalize our capacity across both subsidiaries, which undoubtedly would allow us to minimize capital expenditures going forward, at least for some period of rationalization. Now if that doesn't happen, we'll have to evaluate. But right now, we feel pretty good about where we're at from an overall capacity perspective. Really, the only thing that we're adding from a pure capacity perspective relates to either test capacity or some SSD activity. So I think right now, for the near future, we're going to continue to stay at that, the low end of that range or low end or below.", "Operator", "The next question that I'm showing comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "A question on visibility. Steve, you mentioned expectations for better capacity enterprise into the second half. How has that conversation changed over the last few months?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Well, it's getting increasingly more positive, I guess is maybe the way to say it. I mean, one, order rates are improving, and also, the signaling that we're getting from our customers continues to be increasing or improving. So it's not -- I wouldn't characterize it as a step-function improvement in terms of volume, but we're seeing a nice steady gradual improvement in demand both in terms of actual orders booked as well as in sentiment as we move to the back half of the year.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And then a similar question on visibility from PC OEMs. Has that firmed up a bit also?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes, definitely. I would say that the visibility that we're seeing from a PC manufacturing perspective arguably is the best we've seen in quite a while. I would anticipate that we will continue to see strength in the PC market through the balance of 2014, and we are increasingly optimistic that, that will carry in at least in terms of the first half of 2015.", "Operator", "Next question is from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "A couple of questions. I wanted to dive a little deeper on the SSD front. I saw you launched a new version of the Enterprise SSD that you had acquired from sTec. Can you just talk about the road map there now that you seem to be progressing with some of the products they have? Is that considered the next generation controller, for example? And then I have a follow-up.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Rich, just to clarify, the product that we recently announced is actually a Ultrastar product that is related to the -- our joint development arrangement with Intel. What we have done is unified our road map or rationalized the combined road map between sTec, Virident and HGST. We have a single road map going forward. You will continue to see new product introductions coming out from us on that front, again, as we move to the back half of the year, and we are getting -- we continue to be increasingly optimistic about the road map and the products that we'll be introducing in that space. One other thing to add to that, you saw that this past quarter, our revenue was lower in the SSD space versus prior quarters. If you recall, for the last 2 quarters, we had indicated that we were in a sole-source situation. That customer has now multi-sourced that product so we're seeing our revenue, if you want to call it, normalized, as a result of that. We will -- we expect to see revenue expansion on a quarter-on-quarter basis as we move through the back half of this year and obviously, into 2015 as well.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "So this is the trough for the SSD side?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "That's right, Rich.", "Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then on the drive side, you also announced the 6 terabyte that was non-Helium so presumably, that's shingle. But can you just talk about your view of areal density and if you think we can get consistently back above 20% over the next 12 to 18 months?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Areal density advances will continue to be modest, whether it's in that 20% kind of a range. Until we get to some advanced technologies, and that's really an industry statement, we feel comfortable with where we're at as a company from a competitive technology perspective. And the 6 terabyte product that was recently introduced, 5-Platter, which is clearly leading areal density point, is oriented towards the NAS market. So it's not -- just to clarify, and it's not oriented towards the enterprise market, but more towards the NAS market.", "Operator", "Nehal Chokshi with Technology Insights Research.", "Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC", "Can you talk a little bit about the performance enterprise? What was behind that strength that you saw? And I do have a follow-up as well.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Relative to performance enterprise, just 2 things really to comment on. One, we saw a bit of improved demand from a overall sort of industry perspective. I don't think that there's anything specific to call out that was driving that, just in general, a little bit more strength from an overall industry TAM perspective. More importantly, as it relates to our numbers, is that we saw particular strength as we continued to refresh and build out our product line in the performance enterprise space, and I think that customer acceptance of those products and the capabilities of those products is reflected in our -- in the numbers that we published today.", "Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Technology Insights Research LLC", "Okay. And then I want to revisit lots of color on the PC OEM conversations, which is really great. But can you actually get into what is behind that uniformly positive discussion? Is it more than just temporal enterprise tailwind from the XT end of service?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Well, there's certainly 2 things, in particular, that we're seeing. One is, is that the commercial PC market on a relative basis continues to be stronger than consumer. Albeit, I mean let's be frank, PCs were still flat to slightly down. But we're seeing an improving demand profile in the commercial space, which undoubtedly have to do with a Windows refresh cycle there. The thing that, frankly from my perspective, was probably the most encouraging is that we're beginning to see, let's call it, initial signs of strength in the consumer space or maybe the beginnings of some strength. If you look at the latest data that was published, the rate of decline in the consumer PC space is declining. And now certainly, it's coming off of more favorable compares, but we are beginning to see some initial encouraging signs in terms of commercial PC demand. Now why that's the case? I'm not sure that we know for sure. Arguably, there may be -- there's a lot of PCs out there that haven't been upgraded for a while. And people, rather than, let's say, call it tablets fatigue or what have you, they're diverting dollars that may have previously gone to other devices to finally upgrading their PCs. And so maybe some encouraging news, and we're optimistic that it will continue certainly through 2014, and we're getting more encouraged it will carry into 2015 as well.", "Operator", "Steven Fox with Cross Research.", "Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC", "Two questions for me. First of all, if we look at the revenue growth for the year, it was obviously down slightly. Your markets had been tough, but seems to be turning. I'm thinking back to 2 years ago when you had an Analyst Meeting and talked about sort of like a 4% type of growth for the company as a whole, top line. I was curious if we can revisit that and maybe talk about your comfort level around that as a secular trend if some of these markets do show some more modest recovery. And then I had a follow-up.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Sure. I think that the major change that we've seen since -- jeez, when was that when we had the Analyst Day, a couple of years ago, is that we've seen -- we saw a more severe contraction in terms of the PC market. It's probably the principal thing that we saw. Maybe some other changes in terms of other markets, but I think the biggest driver of that was PCs. I mean, right now, if we were to call the TAM, we would say that we'd be looking at maybe flattish to slightly small single-digits increases. With -- given that we're moving to a richer mix underneath those numbers, maybe modest single-digit revenue increase. That is still with pretty, if you want to call it, conservative. I mean, we still have to continue to see how sustainable the PC market is from a longer-term perspective. And so -- but as we see more encouraging signs in the PC market, we may adjust that, but I think that's kind of where we're at right now.", "Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC", "I appreciate that color. And then just, Steve, one follow-up on what you mentioned with the PCIe roadmap. Can you sort of qualitatively talk about how all these acquisitions are coming together and sort of time frame for maybe seeing something public that we could start to understand how far along you are?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes. I mean I think it's certainly, this quarter, we'll have some things that we'll talk about, and some things we'll continue into the end of the year in terms of new product introductions. We'll get more visibility on that. And not only that, I think that we'll begin to see some more meaningful, I'll call it, revenue accretion from the acquisitions. And again, as Tim indicated in his prepared remarks, we are on course to have those acquisitions be accretive in the first part of 2015. So I would say that on balance, the acquisitions are tracking to our expectations.", "Operator", "Next is Rob Cihra with Evercore.", "Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "I wonder if I could just get a little bit more into sort of the pricing and competitive dynamics in the market. And if you look at the quarter, you guys gained some shares sequentially, and I realize there's some mix elements in there, including gaming, of course, that's probably transient. But I just want to -- if you see market share shifts, in some sense it seems positive, but then sort of the pessimistic side of you says, \"Oh God, if market share is missing around, that means that pricing is more competitive or that there's any kind of competitive posturing going on.\" I mean, do you see any of that working its way into the market, given that we really haven't -- we've had awfully good market for the past couple of years? Or am I being too cautious, and is this simply just a quarter-to-quarter movement based on mix and that sort of thing?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes. Rob, I can certainly appreciate the concern. I think that if you look at what happened -- I mean, that is not what happened. There was not any particular pricing dynamics that drove those share shifts. We've talked about this before. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, share can move around 1 point or 2 depending upon the circumstances. Clearly, the areas that -- we went into the quarter anticipating that we would gain share because, we, for frankly a number of years, have had a particular strength with the gaming customers, and seasonally, we knew that, that was going to be particularly strong in calendar Q2. Then -- so that was no surprise to us and was expected. I think the thing that, if you want to call it, surprised us was notebook PCs were stronger than what we expected. Through both of our subsidiaries, we have a strong position in that market, and given our model, and I would say that at some level, advantaged margin structure, we were able to take advantage of that maybe a little bit easier than other guys, but it wasn't because of any particular pricing dynamics.", "Operator", "Joe Wittine with Longbow Research.", "Joseph Wittine - Longbow Research LLC", "I think I wanted to ask on the guidance here. Just to clarify, does it include a full 14th week of sales? Because I guess, if it does, implied seasonality is down a few points, at least, at the midpoint. And within that, if you could address the seasonal trends by your different buckets on a sequential basis, that would help.", "Timothy M. Leyden", "Yes, it does include the 14th week of sales. Now it's pretty hard to identify how much of it is a difference versus what would normally be a 13-week because, as you know, with the way that the dynamics of the quarters go, generally, there's a fairly strong 13th week and then the first week of the following quarter, it tends to be driven by outside factors, by customer behavior, et cetera. So consequently, it's hard for us to figure out exactly how much we've taken a shot at it, obviously. We're up 7% to 8%. It does include the anticipated uplift that we would get as well. Coming after the weaker June quarter, we would anticipate in normal circumstances -- even in a 13th-week situation, we'd expect some low single-digit increase from the June quarter through the September quarter and then some element of full week that we've loaded in for the beginning of the 1st week of the new quarter, which now becomes our 14th week. And as Steve has indicated, I don't -- we're moving up from somewhere around $138 million or so to around $145 million, but we -- in those numbers, we have anticipated the 14th.", "Joseph Wittine - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay, that's really helpful. And can you just briefly address on a pure organic basis how you see the individual segments trending on a unit basis into September if excluding the additional week?", "Timothy M. Leyden", "Yes, we expect that gaming will stay strong. We expect that notebook will continue to retain its strength. We expect retail, in particular, to be seasonally strong, and we're also expecting some level of comeback in capacity enterprise, and we're expecting performance enterprise to continue its strength as well.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Just to make it real simple, basically, we're expecting reasonable growth, which means that we're seeing reasonable strength in all segments, except for gaming. Not that we're not seeing strength in gaming, but gaming from a TAM perspective will would be roughly flat. Everything else should be up a bit.", "Operator", "Next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Two questions for me. One, I was wondering, Tim, if you could just touch on the cash conversion cycle. It sort of crept up pretty steadily over the last several years. And I'm curious, I mean, you have this target of 4 to 8 days. What does it take for you guys to get there? Is it the approval of MOFCOM? Or can you get there the way the structure is today?", "Timothy M. Leyden", "Yes. Well, our 4 to 8 days is really pre-acquisition model, which is more for a client business rather than enterprise business. And we've held off from revising it because of the fact that since we're operating 2 separate businesses, it's -- it could be a wasted effort until we managed to get over the challenges on efficiency that we have from MOFCOM. So it's something that we're watching, something that we're really paying attention to. I think we've got opportunity in inventory in particular, although we are funding inventory, funding finished goods in order to improve our cost and also in order to buy capital expenditure because we're trying to operate linearly so that we don't have to deal with spikes and have equipment and all the needless spikes. And we're also trying to be cognizant of the challenges in the supply chain. So we're also trying to have a friendlier approach towards the DPOs as well. But we've got a high mix from an enterprise viewpoint, and from a regional viewpoint, we've got a high mix of OEM customers, and that does put a little bit of a cramp on the DSOs.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "That's helpful. And as a follow-on, I was wondering if you'd touch on the 6 terabyte Helium-based drive that you guys have for enterprise market. I believe Seagate has a comparable 6 terabyte drive not based on Helium. But are you seeing a better adoption of these high-capacity drives, especially entering the back half, given the fact that customers now have a dual-source option in that space?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "The first thing is that I would say is that the introduction of our 6 terabyte Helium-filled drive really 2 things: One, it has been well received in the marketplace; and two, it is meeting our expectations from a volume perspective. The second thing that I would say, which we've talked about before, is that the 6 terabyte product that we introduced was principally, I will call it, a technology demonstration. And what -- not that it's not a real product. I don't want to imply that, but we -- from a customer perspective, we want to say, \"Look, this is a platform that we are introducing that we want you to get comfortable with.\" We will continue to introduce follow-on products from a Helium-filled perspective that we believe will be very competitive in the marketplace, and we also believe will drive further increases from a volume perspective. So the 6 terabyte product was not an end-all to be-all so to speak.", "Operator", "Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley.", "Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Given the incremental units in revenue in the September quarter from the 14th week, does that create a flat to down sequential trend in December? Do you think the industry can still grow sequentially even though your comp-ing that 14th week? And then I have a follow-up.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes. Katy, I think that's a very good question. I think it's a little bit too early to call, but if we were to look at it today, we would probably see a decrease going into calendar Q4. If nothing else, really 2 things. One, seasonality has shifted over time. Q4 is not as strong as it used to be. People are putting things on boats to save in terms of transportation cost and those kind of things. And also, the 14th -- going from a 14th week to a 13th week will impact our volumes. And so at this point, we would expect that we would be down going into calendar Q4. The question is, is how much, and that -- it's too early to call that.", "Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then given the strong outlook for the September quarter, better visibility among PC OEMs, why not step up the share buyback, given you're running at higher cash levels versus your peer?", "Timothy M. Leyden", "Yes. I mean, it's something that we look at on an ongoing basis. We're currently pursuing the plan that we outlined in the -- September 2012 at the Investor Day. And we recently -- actually twice in the past year, we increased the dividend, but we're continuing to execute on the plan for 50% of free cash flow. And we've fallen -- sometimes, it gone a little ahead of us, sometimes, we've fallen behind. And this last quarter, we did actually above 62% or so of free cash flow. But it's something we evaluate on an ongoing basis. It was a pretty big change for us as a company. So consequently, it's something that we'll do on a measured basis, but it's not -- but it's something that's on the radar screen all the time.", "Operator", "Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "The first question is if you look at the last quarter, you had talked about some inventive addition like at some of the cloud customers, and then rearchitecting of systems and enterprise customers. You just -- you have talked about that you expect kind of a strength in that quarter-to-quarter, but could you maybe talk more qualitatively the demand trends you're seeing from your cloud customers?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes. I think from a cloud customer perspective, we -- it ties in the comment I made earlier. We are continuing to see the order flow and the sentiment of our customers improve somewhat gradually. Again, it's not a step-function kind of an increase, but we believe that we're going to continue to see an improving demand profile as we move through the back half of the year. And so some of the issues that we talked about last quarter on our call, those have been resolved and sorted out, and we're looking at a more favorable demand environment.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "And the last one for me, the Xyratex acquisition is -- kind of grows. So could you maybe talk about if you are seeing any impact on the share in the enterprise market because of that acquisition by the Seagate or regarding the test equipment support from Teradyne or from Xyratex?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "There's been no impact related to that.", "Well, thank you very much for joining us today and for your interest in Western Digital. I would like to close by thanking our employees worldwide for their dedication and performance throughout fiscal 2014 and our shareholders for their continued support.

Our combined sales from enterprise and client SSDs drove 27% of our third quarter revenue.", "Trying to mobile embedded, the launch of several new smartphones containing our embedded solutions enabled healthy sequential revenue growth with particular strength from sales growth of custom embedded solutions. We believe that Apple\u2019s decision to increase the embedded storage in their mid-tier and top-tier iPhone to 64 GB and 128 GB respectively is indicative of pent-up consumer demand for higher storage capacities.", "We expect other OEMs to follow suit by increasing their embedded storage capacities in their respective offerings and this bodes well for the prospects for our iNAND portfolio as well, as well as the overall demand for [unintelligible] flash.

Our X3 flash and systems technology capabilities allow our customers to increase overall mobile device capacities at competitive cost structures while still delivering outstanding application experience.", "In retail, revenue increased slightly from the previous quarter but declined modestly on a year over year basis with growth in Micro SD cards offset by decline in SD cards. Our over global retail presence remain solid, backed by our valuable brand and consumer recognition of our high-quality products. We are positioned well as we head into the seasonally strong period of the year. ", "Turning to industry demand, we continue to see multiple strong growth drivers for flash, and the demand outlook remains robust. Even as mobile market shares shift among different OEMs, overall smartphone shipments remain on a strong trajectory and we are very pleased to see the average capacity growth in these devices drive strong demand for flash.", "In client computing, I\u2019m sure you will agree with me that once you have become used to an SSD-powered laptop, there is no going back. Consequently, the increasing penetration rate of flash in corporate laptops will spill into the consumer space and drive significant growth in flash penetration in the PC platforms in the years ahead.", "Finally, enterprise and hyperscale customers continue to work with market leaders like SanDisk to find new ways to use flash in an ever-increasing number of applications and workloads, as flash technology is a critical foundation of the modern day responsive enterprise.

Q3 was another strong quarter for SanDisk, with revenue growing 7% year over year to an all-time record of $1.75 billion. We delivered excellent gross margins, very strong free cash flow, and non-GAAP operating margin of 28%, even with restructuring charges and the inclusion of the Fusion-io business.", "With rapid progress on our integration initiatives, we are well on our way to meeting our goal of Fusion-io being accretive to earnings in the second half of 2015. On a year over year basis, our commercial channel revenue grew 13%, while retail revenue was down 2%. ", "The primary source of our growth in the commercial channel was SSDs, both enterprise and client solutions. Within the retail channel, sales of SD cards decreased due to the declining camera market, partially offset by growth in demand for micro SD cards.", "Sequentially, our commercial revenue grew 8%, driven by embedded growth, and our retail revenue grew 5%, driven by back to school USB sales and mobile cards. Sales in the retail channel comprised 32% of our Q3 revenue mix, compared to 35% in the year ago quarter.", "Our total petabytes sold increased 9% sequentially and 43% year over year. Our captive bit sales grew faster than our captive bit supply, resulting in further reduction to our captive inventory levels. Our overall inventory increased sequentially because of the non-captive inventory acquired in the Fusion-io transaction.", "Looking at revenue by product category, our SSD revenue grew 48% year over year, with the strongest growth coming from enterprise SSDs. Sequentially, our SSD revenue grew 1% with growth in enterprise SSD revenue offset by a decline from client SSD.", "The sequential decline in client SSD revenue reflected demand timing from certain customers as well as our own supply allocation decisions. Our embedded revenue was down 16% year over year, and up 30% sequentially.", "The sequential increase in embedded revenue came from both custom embedded and iNAND solutions. Our removable products revenue, which includes sales in both retail and commercial channels, was flat year over year and up 1% sequentially.", "Our Q3 non-GAAP gross margin increased sequentially to 49%, benefitting from a stronger mix of product sales and a higher usage of X3 memory, which made up more than 50% of our revenue bits. Our blended price per gigabyte and cost per gigabyte both came down 3% sequentially, inclusive of the impact of product mix and average capacity growth.", "1Y nanometer technology comprised approximately two-thirds of our petabytes sold, and the yen rate in our cost of sales was 101, consistent with the rate in the second quarter. ", "Our Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses increased $63 million sequentially, with $25 million of the increase reflecting restructuring charges and the remainder of the growth driven by 10 weeks of Fusion-io operating expenses. ", "Without the impact of Fusion-io, SanDisk\u2019s standalone expenses were approximately flat from the second quarter, less than originally forecasted, primarily due to the timing of certain R&D expenditures.", "Restructuring expenses were $10 million less than originally forecasted, largely due to lower charges for IT integration and employee severance. Related to the Fusion-io acquisition, our GAAP costs and expenses also include $11 million of stock compensation charges related to acceleration of Fusion-io equity awards held by certain former Fusion-io employees, $17 million related to amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and $5 million of inventory step-up charges.", "Our non-GAAP Q3 diluted share count declined sequentially by 1.9 million shares, as share repurchases more than offset dilution from the 2017 warrants and employee shares. Our non-GAAP tax rate came down slightly and our non-GAAP EPS was $1.45, inclusive of restructuring charges.", "Q3 cash flow from operations was a robust $588 million, and cash used for capital investments was $116 million, yielding free cash flow of $471 million.

Our cash flow statement also reflects $1.07 billion spent on the Fusion-io acquisition, which is net of $190 million of cash acquired.", "On the balance sheet, our inventory dollars grew by $30 million sequentially, inclusive of $77 million of non-captive inventory received in the Fusion-io acquisition. Our captive inventory has fallen two quarters in a row, and while we entered the year expecting to draw down inventory, we now have pockets of supply constraint exacerbated by the lower 2014 supply bit growth resulting from the long tail of 19 nanometer production for strategic customers.", "I will now turn to forward-looking commentary. For the fourth quarter, we have strong demand signals from our customers in all key product categories. We expect to further reduce our captive inventory levels in Q4 to fulfil demand. However, we expect to be in supply allocation and this will constrain our growth in some areas in Q4.", "We will prioritize our business according to our strategic priorities and customer relationships. Our fourth quarter revenue forecast is $1.8 billion to $1.85 billion. As we look to 2015, we plan to increase our supply bit growth from less than 25% this year to a range of 30% to 40%. Given the lean level of inventory we will have at the end of 2014, our 2015 revenue bit growth will likely need to be at the low end of that range.", "For Q4, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 47% and 49%. Our yen rate in the fourth quarter is determined primarily by third quarter purchases, which include some hedges placed approximately a year ago, yielding an expected fourth quarter yen rate in cost of sales similar to the rate in the last two quarters.", "Our Q4 2014 wafer purchases, which will impact Q1 2015 cost of sales, will be based approximately on two-thirds market rate purchases in Q4 and one third on hedges placed a year ago at approximately 99. ", "With the current yen denominated content in our cost of sales, a 10% move in the yen rate in our cost of sales generates approximately a 200 basis point change in our gross margin. To date, we have not placed any hedges for 2015, so if market rates stay comparable to today, this will be a benefit to 2015 costs. ", "We expect Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses of $380 million to $390 million, reflecting a full quarter of Fusion-io related expenses and inclusive of restructuring expenses of approximately $15 million. Q4 non-GAAP other income is forecasted at approximately $3 million, and we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be equal to the Q3 rate of 31.2%.", "We expect our Q4 non-GAAP diluted share count to come down to approximately $228 million, reflecting continued share repurchases.", "We are refining our estimate of 2014 capital investments from $1.4 billion to $1.3 billion, with Q4 gross investments expected to be approximately $400 million inclusive of both joint venture and non-fab investments.", "The fourth quarter cash usage for capital investments is expected to be approximately $150 million, bringing the full year cash usage for capital investments to approximately $350 million for the combination of joint venture and non-fab investments.

", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Judy. Thank you, Sanjay. Operator, can I ask you to poll the floor for questions. And if I can ask the callers to limit themselves to one question and a brief follow up.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator instructions.] And we do have our first question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group ", "Judy, a quick follow up on your guide. What would be the pro forma gross margin excluding [unintelligible] restructuring?", "Judy Bruner ", "The restructuring expenses are included on a separate line in our P&L in expense operating expenses, and so the restructuring expenses are not impacting gross margin. So my guide for the Q4 gross margin is 47% to 49% on a non-GAAP basis, and that\u2019s not impacted by restructuring.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group ", "And then one follow up for Sanjay, as you start ramping the 15 nanometer, how should we think about the impact on your cost structure, since different competitors have a different die size? So can you either qualitatively or quantitatively talk about the decline in the die size, how it would impact your cost structure per bit? Because when I look at it on the surface, 1Y to 15 nanometer doesn\u2019t seem huge, but I\u2019m just wondering if your die is different than competitors, and how it would impact the cost per bit.", "Sanjay Mehrotra ", "We believe we have the smallest die in production. We will have the smallest die in production with our 1Z nanometer, which we are starting to ramp this quarter. And our 1Z, we believe, will continue to give us the lowest-cost die in X2, as well as with X3 memories. And remember, at the product level, the total cost is the cost of the flash memory as well as cost of all the non-flash memory components that go into our overall product cost structure.", "And with respect to 1Z, at the memory level itself, in terms of cost reduction capability, 1Z technology, transition from 1Z to 1Y will give us more cost reduction than the transition from 19 nanometer to 1Y. But our cost leadership in the industry will continue, with our 1Z. Again, the smallest die and the lowest cost die in production at the memory level, in the industry.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group ", "So the takeaway here is the 1Y to 1Z is more cost reduction than 19 to 1Y, correct?", "Sanjay Mehrotra ", "That\u2019s correct at the memory level.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Doug Freedman of RBC Capital Markets. ", "Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets ", "Judy, one of the things I\u2019m struggling with, it looks like your reported inventory actually went up, but it sounds like it\u2019s a mix-related issue, and you\u2019re telling us, if I heard correctly, that we should expect some pockets of demand that go unserviced in the fourth quarter. What do you think will happen to that demand? Will you be able to service that in Q1 of 2015?", "Judy Bruner ", "So just to clarify first, on the inventory, the inventory dollars in total did go up, but that was driven by the non-captive inventory that we acquired as part of the Fusion-io acquisition. Our captive inventory, which we need for servicing the vast majority of our demand, actually went down for the second quarter in a row. And the non-captive inventory is earmarked for the Fusion-io related products and business.", "We will work hard in the fourth quarter to meet the needs of our customers and service the demand out there, but we do, as I said, expect to have pockets of supply constraint. And we will be implementing another capacity expansion, as Sanjay described, in 2015, in order to build some capacity. And in terms of overall demand, we believe our strategic customers, we will work very closely with them, and that demand will not go away for SanDisk.", "Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets ", "And if I could, for my follow up, you talked in the past about introducing more three bit per cell SSD products. Can you give us an update on how that is going? And if you wouldn\u2019t mind, maybe in answering that, giving us an idea of how much bit growth, moving from MLC output to TLC will contribute.", "Sanjay Mehrotra ", "So in terms of client SSD with X3, we are making very good progress there, and these products with X3 are in qualification stages with customers. We look at it more as a 2015, the X3 revenue, unfortunately in client SSD for us. It will continue to ramp up primarily from Q1 onward timeframe.", "In terms of X3 mix in our total product sales, X3 mix will increase next year compared to this year, but it\u2019s all baked in our bit growth guidance that we have provided today.", " ", "Operator", "Next we have a question from Timothy Arcuri of Cowen & Company.", "Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Company ", "First of all, Judy, can you break out the FIO portion of revenue and cost to sort of help us see where results would have been ex-Fusion-io?", "Judy Bruner ", "We\u2019re not going to break out the specific Fusion-io related revenue and cost, but I will tell you that the Fusion-io revenue was down sequentially from the prior run rate of the Fusion business, and that was our expectation. So the revenue level met our expectation. We expected that it would be down sequentially, of course due to the fact that it only included 10 weeks versus 13 weeks, but also due to the integration of the business and the sales force. They had a fairly large sales force, and we needed to integrate that into SanDisk, determine account ownership, territory leadership, commission plans, etc.", "So overall, we\u2019re very pleased with how that integration is going, and we believe that the Fusion-io revenue will grow from this point forward. Also, I will tell you that the Fusion-io gross margin, even using non-captive memory, is accretive to the SanDisk gross margin, meaning the Fusion-io product gross margin is higher than the corporate average of the SanDisk gross margin.", "Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Company ", "And then Sanjay, I wanted to get your perspective on this news that XMC is partnering with Spansion to develop 3D NAND and they\u2019re claiming that they\u2019re going to be producing it in 2017. I just wanted to get your view on that, whether that\u2019s plausible, and whether that\u2019s something that you\u2019re thinking about.", "Sanjay Mehrotra ", "You know, my view is that NAND is a highly complex device technology. You know, the device structure, the manufacturing process technologies. These really are absolutely leading edge in the entire semiconductor industry. And to build experience in this and to be successful in this really requires many generations of the technology transition capability under your belt, just like the flash suppliers in the industry today have. ", "So I believe that it is very hard for a new entrant to catch up [with] a leading edge technology node, with building a flash memory that has the reliability, that has the overall cost structure and overall specifications that are required to meet the broad range of market applications. And not only technology complexity, of course to be a successful player in this you require scale of operations as well.", "So I look at this really, at this point, given the barriers to entry with respect to technology learning curve, manufacturing learning curve, as well as the scale of production and all the IP considerations that go into building a leading edge flash technology roadmap, I see this really as a very uphill task, and I don\u2019t see this as something for a new entrant to become successful or for us to worry about, frankly.", "And of course the systems expertise is also required. Today, flash is not just about making a NAND flash memory chip. It is about control of [unintelligible], all the product solutions are really all about system level expertise as well.", "Operator", "We have a question from Craig Ellis of B. Riley & Company. ", "Craig Ellis - B. Riley & Company", "I wanted to go back to the comments that the company would see 30% to 40% bit supply growth next year. Can you help us understand what the parameters are that would differentiate the company coming in closer to the low end of that range versus the company coming in closer to the high end of that range?", "Judy Bruner ", "First of all, the 30% to 40% bit supply growth bakes into it the approximately 5% capacity expansion that Sanjay described. Also bakes in the technology transition with 1Z ramping across the year, and bakes in a higher X3 mix in our revenue next year than in our revenue this year. ", "So those three areas as well would be the key areas where we could be higher or lower across the year. It will depend on the yield ramp of our 1Z technology, and also on the demand that we see for our X3-based products, and of course on the fab productivity. We are always looking for ways to get more wafer output through fab productivity investments, such as installing bottleneck tools, and those will also be areas of focus in 2015.", "Craig Ellis - B. Riley & Company ", "And then as the follow up, I think in the past when the company\u2019s gone through a manufacturing transition, there\u2019s generally, once it starts rolling, about a 10% to 15% per quarter mix towards that new node. Is that the right framework to look at for the 15 nanometer ramp, and if so, when would the company expect to see the current tightness that you\u2019re seeing in the business alleviate somewhat so you were able to capture all of the demand that you see out there. ", "Sanjay Mehrotra ", "The 1Z technology node will be primarily [unintelligible] meaningful starting from Q1 of next year and will continue to ramp up into production throughout the course of 2015 timeframe. And as Judy pointed out, it is also about qualifying various products with our customers using that 1Z technology node.", "I would expect the ramp of 1Z technology node, at the end of next year, to achieve a similar percentage in terms of [unintelligible] output [unintelligible] as 1Y has now. That means 1Z technology mix at the end of next year to be around 60%. And as we said, production ramp is starting this quarter, becoming meaningful from Q1, and continuing to ramp during the course of the year.", "And again, that is all baked into our revenue base as well as the supply bit guidance.", "Craig Ellis - B. Riley & Company ", "And when would the current tightness be alleviated with that ramp?", "Sanjay Mehrotra ", "We see strong demand in all product categories for our business in 2015 timeframe. And SanDisk\u2019s focus will continue to be to have the best mix in terms of high-value solutions in our revenue. And I believe we are really executing very well in that strategy. I mean, when you look at the 2014 timeframe, we have outgrown the industry in terms of revenue. That means our revenue growth is on track, I believe, to be higher in 2014 than the industry revenue growth. ", "In 2015, I see that our revenue dollar share will continue to outperform our revenue bit share, and then all the strong demand drivers that we see in 2015, it is likely that certain pockets of supply constraint may exist during the course of the year. But this is something we have become very good at managing in terms of the overall mix of the business to achieve the best combination of revenue, profits, and cash flow, as well as really address the key considerations for our strategic customers and continue to drive the long term growth of the company. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ambrish Srivastava of BMO.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets ", "I think a quick follow up on Fusion-io. What percentage of the bits sold, of the 9%, was due to Fusion-io?", "Judy Bruner ", "The Fusion-io bits used are actually a pretty small number of bits. These are all non-captive. And I would tell you that non-captive memory usage for us is a low single digit percentage of our overall bits.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets ", "And the second one is, your largest customer was 70% of total in the first half, and what is it in Q3, and what\u2019s your expectation in Q4?", "Judy Bruner ", "For Q3, we have a customer that is 20% of our revenue, but we\u2019re not providing a guidance for Q4.", "Operator", "From Mark Newman, Bernstein.", "Mark Newman - Sanford Bernstein", "Wanted to ask questions specifically on longer-term supply and demand. Very encouraged to hear the comments on the supply constraint your seeing in the market, especially in light of the increasing content per box from iPhone recently. I guess my question, though, is, there\u2019s a lot of concern out there right now that demand in the market overall, not just specifically to NAND flash, may slow down. There\u2019s just general concern out there. ", "And so just in light of, if there is any kind of shock or surprise, global recession, or any kind of event that would reduce your demand growth expectations, I wonder if you could share with us how you would alleviate that concern. You know, thinking about your current plans of 5% capacity growth next year, looking at your inventory levels you have, which you said, excluding the Fusion-io impact are actually getting leaner, if you could explain to us what kind of flexibility you have to offset any kind of short term demand, slowing down, and what the impact would be to SanDisk. ", "Judy Bruner ", "I\u2019ll take that. You know, I think that as one thinks about potential macroeconomic risks out there, that is one good reason to manage capacity prudently, which we are absolutely doing. And of course another good reason is to be focused, as we always are, on the ROI of capacity expansion, and thinking ahead to the transition ahead to 3D memory from 2D memory. But we are conscious of thinking about macroeconomic risks. We believe that the capacity expansion we have is very prudent, and we believe most likely we will have pockets of supply constraint in various times in 2015.", "We grew nicely in the third quarter. We do believe there were probably some macroeconomic factors impacting us, such as within our retail business, we did see less revenue than we had expected, in certain emerging markets in the third quarter, such as Latin America, Russia, and Middle East and Africa. ", "So we are conscious of that. We\u2019re monitoring it very closely, but I feel very comfortable with our capacity plans for 2015. We absolutely need that 5% capacity that we are planning to add.", "Sanjay Mehrotra ", "And do you mind if I just add that in addition to our disciplined capacity strategy, taking into consideration the kinds of things you referred to, what\u2019s important is that SanDisk really, in our market, is uniquely positioned with a broad engagement with customers, diversified set of customers, in all markets, all channels, all end market applications, and we, as Judy has said, we have the broadest portfolio of solutions as well.", "So this really positions us very well in terms of managing the mix of the businesses, regardless of the considerations that may occur in one market segment versus another segment, or one region versus another region. Our unique position, with our broad portfolio and diverse set of customers, and deep ecosystem engagement, and really tremendous sales and customer support reach, I believe is a huge advantage in us continuing to drive the business, taking into consideration all possible factors, whether macroeconomic or geopolitical in nature. ", "Mark Newman - Sanford Bernstein ", "But would you specifically consider, if demand was substantially lower than expected, to delay capacity expansion, or I guess another thing you can do is reduce your non-captive bit mix?", "Sanjay Mehrotra ", "Our non-captive bit mix is primarily for Fusion-io in the 2015 timeframe. And I feel very good about our capacity plan. It\u2019s a very modest addition of our capacity in 2015, with supply bit growth in the 30% to 40%. And as Judy mentioned, we need to build up some of our inventory position to service our customers well, and that puts our revenue bit growth towards the lower end of that 30% to 40% range. ", "So I feel very good about the demand trends that we see in our market. I men, when you look at smartphones, the average capacities that continue to increase in smartphones, certainly you look at notebook computers, the flash attach rate to notebooks absolutely continuing to increase, and on the enterprise side, this is just early innings, and this market will continue to evolve very nicely.", "So I feel pretty confident about our capacity strategy here.", "Judy Bruner ", "I\u2019ll just add that we really expect to have a quite tight supply demand balance within our business across 2015. And we are focused on keeping it that way, in part in order to continue to consistently produce the world-class operating margins that we produce consistently, within our target financial model of 25% to 30%.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs ", "Can you help me understand what your expectations for ASPs are in the fourth quarter? And then if you\u2019re able to improve your ASP through either mix or like-for-like price increases given the supply demand situation that you\u2019ve articulated?", "Judy Bruner ", "For the fourth quarter, we expect a very healthy supply demand environment in the industry, so we would expect price movement to be modest in the fourth quarter.", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs ", "And then there\u2019s been a fair amount of M&A in the SSD market, both [unintelligible] but also in the industry more broadly, and I\u2019m hoping you can help me understand if the competitive landscape has changed at all, either in terms of the competitors you\u2019re seeing, the quality of the products that SanDisk is matching up against, or how challenging the pricing is in the SSD market specifically.", "Sanjay Mehrotra ", "In the SSD market, you know, there is the client market as well as the enterprise. And SanDisk, with our vertical integration capabilities and particularly in enterprise side, with the recent acquisition of Fusion-io, and in the past, starting with [unintelligible] and then Smart Storage, and then adding capabilities in the software area, I believe we have the best capabilities that are out there in terms of driving the enterprise SSD growth. ", "And on the client side as well, as you have seen, we have grown revenue, I think, brilliantly well over the course of the last couple of years, in client SSD. So SanDisk really, on client SSD, as well as on the enterprise SSD side, has what it takes to continue to build its market leadership position.", "Judy Bruner ", "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a competitor out there that can match up to the breadth of the SSD product line that we have, particularly in enterprise, with our SaaS products, our SATA products, PCIe, DDR, software on top of that. We really do have the most complete portfolio.", "Operator", "Our next question is from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse.", "John Pitzer - Credit Suisse ", "Sanjay, I guess my first question is I\u2019d like to better understand how you view your relationship with strategic customers, because clearly, I think one of the investor frustrations out there is given how tight supply is now, you\u2019re just not really moving the dial on ASP or margin. And I\u2019m just kind of curious, how do you define a strategic customer, what kind of return do you need to see on that customer to make it worth your while to kind of give up some near term gains of moving mix or margin? And even with strategic customers, given how tight the environment is, why not raise pricing even with the strategic customers? If the relationship is that important, it should be a two-way street, not just a one-way street.", "Sanjay Mehrotra ", "I think our relationship with a broad spectrum of strategic customers is excellent and only continuing to get deeper and broader as we expand our solutions offerings, from embedded solutions to SSD solutions, to enterprise solutions. So I feel very good about SanDisk\u2019s strategic relationship. And when you look at our results, I believe SanDisk is able to certainly deliver value to our customers and also get our customers to give value to SanDisk. Because when you look at our operating margins, in our industry, I believe they\u2019re the best. When you look at, by any measure in the semiconductor industry, our operating margins are among the very best.", "And in terms of our price decline, if you look at it on a year over year basis, I believe we are on track to have our price decline to be less than the industry price decline in the 2014 timeframe. All of this is because of SanDisk\u2019s capability to really have a strong portfolio of solutions, a strong value proposition for our customers, and to continue to drive a strong mix of our business as well.", "And of course we focus on strategic areas, and in terms of strategic areas, things that are important for us, are areas where we can drive innovation, where our customers are driving innovation, where SanDisk is able to bring value to the customers, as well as get value from the customers. That\u2019s very important, and I think we have made tremendous progress in this regard over the course of the last several quarters.", "John Pitzer - Credit Suisse ", "And then as a follow up to Judy, just quickly two quick things. First, am I doing the math right? If I exclude FiOS from the December guide, is the core business about flat year over year? And then on the margin guidance being the same this quarter as you gave for the September quarter, I would have thought that maybe with more Fusion-io, probably a richer mix of branded retail around the holidays, and maybe some more X3, that there might have been some more gross margin upside. Just kind of curious what else is going within the mix of business, September to December, that would be kind of depressing margins a bit?", "Judy Bruner ", "First, the so-called legacy SanDisk business is growing quarter over quarter and year over year, even if you exclude the Fusion-io business. And in terms of the gross margins for the fourth quarter, the range of 47% to 49%, that is a similar range to what we have experienced over the last two quarters. ", "And I will point out that in the fourth quarter, we expect to see a higher proportion, of course, of retail promotional activity. That\u2019s always the case in terms of holiday promotions for the retail business. So that has some impact on margin. And we do expect to see growth in our overall embedded solutions revenue, and embedded is one area that has gross margins that are somewhat less than the corporate average.", "But overall, 47% to 49% gross margin and an operating margin within our target financial model is really world-class performance, and we feel very good about being able to grow the revenue and produce that level of competitive operating margin and do it consistently. ", "Operator", "CJ Muse with ISI Group. ", "CJ Muse - ISI Group", "I guess Sanjay, a bigger picture question for you. If you think about [unintelligible] NAND bits and reluctance to add [unintelligible] in the industry given the obsolescence factor and the eventual move to 3D, coupled with 3D likely taking longer given the yield challenges there, I guess I\u2019m curious, do you think we\u2019ll see a change here where pricing trends, similar to John\u2019s earlier question, can start to move up? Do you start to look to sign longer contracts, a la in the DRAM side, seeing three-plus month contracts?", "I think the question, or where I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts is the fact that it\u2019s getting harder and harder to add bits, it\u2019s more and more capital intensive. Why would you not ask to get paid more for that?", "Sanjay Mehrotra ", "So I think we have been discussing this for a couple of years, that the technology complexity in the NAND industry is increasing tremendously. It\u2019s taking longer to develop new technology nodes. The gain coming from each successive 2D NAND generation is smaller compared to what it was in the past. And of course, as we all know, 2D NAND is approaching the end of its life, and 3D NAND, in the future years, will start ramping into production.", "So we have always said that these technology complexities do definitely bring a stabilizing effect to the industry in terms of the supply bit growth, and certainly in terms of the pricing environment as well, because the demand trends for flash are secular in nature in multiple megamarkets for flash.", "So certainly it has already been playing out that the increasing technology complexity, the greater capital investment that is required, the upcoming transition from 2D to 3D, and therefore considerations of ROI on any new capacity, all of this is playing a role in reduced levels of supply bit growth compared to the years past, while the demand trends really continue to be solid, if anything, continue to pick up momentum in the marketplace.", "So these trends are translating into an industry environment that is significantly more healthy, more robust, than any time in the past. And SanDisk certainly is very much focused on making sure that we are really driving our supply toward the best mix of solutions and as part of that, we absolutely manage our pricing consideration with our customers, very closely, as I said. ", "We want to make sure that for our valuable bits that we produce, and for the tremendous technology investment that we have, that we are getting the recognition of that from our customers in terms of pricing as well. I believe we are doing a good job, and we stay focused on continuing to improve the mix and allocate our supply with considerations of pricing and margin from our variety of customers and end markets, keeping that in mind. ", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley.", "Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley ", "For the last couple of quarters, you\u2019ve had this inventory drawdown, and yet revenues have been kind of in the middle of expectations. Has this been your plan going into the quarter, to draw down the inventory, or did something happen over the course of the quarter that they ended up coming down? And if you didn\u2019t expect to draw it down, then why didn\u2019t it drive some revenue upside?", "Judy Bruner ", "We have been planning to draw down inventory this year. In fact, I believe at the beginning of the year, I indicated that our revenue bit growth in 2014 could be greater than our supply bit growth, because we did expect to draw down inventory. ", "And we have drawn it down, and credit goes also to the efficiency of our supply chain organization, which has made a number of improvements that have allowed us to draw down the inventory weeks of supply even as the mix of our business has moved more towards SSDs, which tend to have longer cycle times and hub requirements and so on.", "So yes, we\u2019ve always planned, over the course of this year, to draw down inventory. But at this point, we\u2019re operating at very lean levels of inventory, and that\u2019s what\u2019s creating pockets of supply constraint.  ", "Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley ", "And then if I go back a few years ago, you guys used to buy a decent amount of non-captive product, because you have a lot of value-added segments, and you were able to get pretty good margin on that. As you see these constraints, have you entertained the idea of doing that again, more broadly?", "Judy Bruner ", "Well, we are, as we mentioned earlier, planning for 2015 to largely use non-captive for the Fusion-io based business, so clearly we\u2019re trying to use non-captive there. Relative to the other commercial parts of our business, it\u2019s difficult to use non-captive once you have worked with your customers to qualify the products on your own captive solution. You can\u2019t just suddenly switch over to a different product with them once you\u2019ve gone through qualification. ", "So it\u2019s very difficult in our commercial business. In our retail business, there our business is particularly well-suited for the leading edge X3 memory that we\u2019re producing in our own fabs. So it is difficult to use non-captive outside of areas where we, for example, have done an acquisition, and it\u2019s already on non-captive, and then we can keep it there.

Welcome to Western Digital\u2019s First Quarter Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2015. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.", "Robert Blair", "Thank you. I want to mention at the outset that we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions, concerning, among others, our position in the growth of data and the storage ecosystem; the growth areas in storage; our investment focus; our product offerings and our customers\u2019 responses to those offerings; and our financial performance, including our financial results or expectations for the December quarter.", "These forward-looking statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-K filed with the SEC on August 15, 2014.", "We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events.

Because the amount of these items is not fully known to us at this time, we are unable to provide guidance for or reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures.", "We ask participants to limit themselves today to a single question and one follow-up question during our Q&A section of the call. I also want to note the copies of remarks from this call will be available on the Investors section of Western Digital\u2019s website immediately following the conclusion of the call.", "And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Steve Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, Olivier Leonetti will provide additional commentary on our September quarter performance and our outlook for the December quarter.", "Olivier joined Western Digital in early September as Chief Financial Officer. He is a welcome addition to our team, with many years of global finance experience, both at Amgen and Dell. I want to thank and acknowledge our former CFO, Tim Leyden for his 24 years of leadership and served us at Western Digital and we wish him the best and his retirement starting the first of the year.", "As anticipated market demand improved in the September quarter and we achieved strong revenue EPS and gross margin performance. We also continued to generate healthy cash flow. The diversified nature of our business, coupled with the ongoing secular growth in data, and our crisp execution continue to allow us to demonstrate strong and consistent financial performance, we expect this trend will continue.", "For the September quarter the industry CAM came in at the higher end of expectations. This reflected quarter-over-quarter growth and capacity enterprise, client, branded and consumer electronics and stable demand in performance enterprise.", "We saw the same trends in our own business, with notable strength in our client, capacity enterprise and flash platform solutions businesses. The ladder of which includes our expanding line up of enterprise class SSDs. The industry demand outlook for the December quarter reflects a modest sequential decline with moderation in client and CE partially offset by continued strength in capacity enterprise, and branded and steady demand in performance enterprise.", "We believe industry supply and demand and associated inventory levels remain balanced. Looking at our business for the December quarter, we see the same trends. Moderation in client and CE, strong momentum in branded in capacity enterprise as well as in our flash related business, and continued steadiness in performance enterprise.", "As a company at the center of the storage industry, this is an exciting time for Western Digital. There is tremendous change underway and how and where value will be created. All around as the storage ecosystem is transforming with ongoing focus on how data is stored, accessed, protected and how it has been used and monetized.", "All of these changes are driving a diverse set of needs for our customers, and opportunities for our company. We are working with our customers and partners to help extract more and more value from data in an innovative and cost effective manner, across our full spectrum of products.", "I continue to be encouraged by our broad-based strategy both in terms of our financial results, and customer feedback. For instance, our flash platform solutions group resumed, as faster than an industry growth trajectory with revenue of $156 million for the September quarter. We remain on track to achieve accretive earnings for this business, early in calendar 2015.", "Our broad lineup of high capacity hard drives, based on our proprietary HelioSeal platform, has been very well received by both traditional enterprise and hyperscale datacenter customers, including the new 8 terabyte and 10 terabyte models announced last month.", "We recently shipped our one millionth WD Purple hard drive architected to address the high-growth space of security surveillance video applications. Governments\u2019 and other large organizations\u2019 increasing use of video and digital network cameras is driving a huge need for a high resolution recording.", "Our enterprise customers have responded very positively to our newly announced Active Archive offering from our newly formed Elastic Storage\u00a0Group. And in the personal cloud, we continue to grow our My Cloud business with expansion in all geographies addressing consumer and prosumer markets.", "Olivier will now review our first quarter results and cover our outlook for the December quarter.", "Olivier Leonetti", "Thank you, Steve and delighted to be part of the team. Expected seasonal demand and consistent execution helped us exceed financial expectations in the September quarter. Industry shipments were in line with the TAM implied in our guidance provided in July.", "In our business, we saw the anticipated seasonal increase in demand for client and branded products as well as strength in capacity enterprise and continued steady demand in performance enterprise. Aggregated channel inventories of Western Digital products remain at the low end of our four to six week range.", "Our revenue for the September quarter was $3.9 billion. This included $156 million in revenue related to our Flash Platforms group, which includes enterprise SSDs. As a reminder, we continue to expect that our flash related revenue growth will outpace the growth rate of the industry.", "We shipped a total of $64.7 million hard drives at an average selling price of $58. The quarter-over-quarter increase in overall ASP was driven by business mix, consistent with the seasonal improvement in client, branded and the strength in capacity enterprise. Our gross margin was 29.1%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 30.1% which was better than our implied guidance due to business mix. This excludes $39 million of amortization of intangibles.", "Operating expenses totaled $680 million. Our non-GAAP operating expense was $638 million, excluding $42 million of amortization of intangibles, litigation charges and employee termination costs. The additional expenses to our guidance primarily relates to incentive compensation and stock appreciation rights. Our net income totaled $423 million or $1.76 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $504 million or $2.10 per share.", "Turning to the balance sheet, in our fourteen week quarter we generated $827 million in cash from operations and our free cash flow totaled $667 million. Our CapEx totaled $160 million or 4% of revenue. We repurchased 2.2 million shares for $223 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.40 per share.", "We closed Q1 with total cash and cash equivalents of $5.2 billion of which approximately $1.2 billion was held in the U.S. I\u2019ll now provide our guidance for the December quarter. We expect revenue to be in a range of $3.75 billion to $3.85 billion. Gross margin to be flat with the December quarter level of 30%, excluding the amortization of intangibles.", "R&D and SG&A spending of approximately $600 million, excluding the amortization of intangibles. A tax rate of approximately 8%, and a share count of approximately $238 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $2.00 and $2.10 for the December quarter.", "Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s call. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank North America", "Hi, thank you. I was hoping you could just go through the puts and takes on the gross margin guidance for the fourth quarter. I would think that the client business being may be at the softer you have better mix in the quarter. So I was just trying to understand that a bit better. Thanks.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "So if you look at Sherri. This is Steve. We\u2019re going to take a small absorption had in terms of lower volumes that will be offset by favorable mix in terms of capacity enterprise and certainly we will see a little bit, client margins tend to be a little bit lower than the corporate as a general statement, but on balance things that net out to the extent that we think that our margins will be flat, quarter-on-quarter.", "Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank North America", "Okay, thanks Steve. That\u2019s helpful. And then, it\u2019s been a while since your last Analyst Day. I wanted to see if you could provide an update on your, on priorities for cash, in terms of how much you expect to use for buybacks and your plans to increase the dividend. Thank you.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "So, we continue to be committed to the capital allocation plan that we announced back in September 2012, in terms of 50% of our free cash-flow been returned to shareholders and the rest to be \u2013 I will call it held in reserve for potential strategic opportunities, as we look at the changes that we see in the storage ecosystem, we continue to think that there are opportunities for us to \u2013 I\u2019ll say expand our footprint, in terms of the storage industry and ways that not only add value for our customers, but also add value for our shareholders.", "So at present, we are sticking with that capital allocation plan; of course we periodically review that, as a part of our overall review of our strategic priorities, but at this point there is no intend to change in our capital allocation plans.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital. Your line is open.", "Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Capital", "Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the early solid quarter and Olivier welcome. I guess yes two if I could I guess both on kind of datacenter and cloud, so the SSD revenue was quite strong sequentially this quarter. Could you talk to \u2013 to what degree that was related to hyper scale build out, which you guys had talked to expecting and to what degree they\u2019re related, I guess, OEM product refraction? And then I have a follow-up in that regard as well. Thanks.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "", "So let me kind of opine in a broader picture. We are seeing broad based strength in terms of the broader enterprise business, both in terms of traditional customers as well as the hyperscale data center customers, both in terms of our capacity enterprise business, which we saw a nice pickup this past quarter. We expect that momentum to continue into the December quarter and correspondingly we\u2019re also seeing, as you indicated, strong strength in our enterprise SSD business.", "That is really, I\u2019ll call it, across the board and really speaks to the strength of our product line both in terms of \u2013 well, really across the board, performance enterprise, capacity enterprise as well as in terms of enterprise SSD. We clearly have the broadest product line in the industry and not only that. We have the broadest products that we arguably believe that we got very strong performance from a product standpoint as well. So that\u2019s being reflected in our performance as well as the build out that we\u2019re continuing to see from the customer perspective.", "Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Capital", "", "Steve, that\u2019s really helpful context. I appreciate. And I guess just in that regard how are you guys thinking about the cadence of hyperscale deployments as we get into the first half of the year given there\u2019s a lot of, I guess, call it lack of pent-up demand coming in the second half of year? And then also, how are you guys thinking about, I don\u2019t know, the adoption kind of curve just in the enterprise, [tried and true] (ph) enterprise given that second half of the year is a heavy product cycle, second half with the OEM? Thanks.", "", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Sure. I mean we have, I\u2019ll call it, increasing visibility. Obviously, we had good visibility till the December quarter probably in terms of what we see from a demand perspective. We got increasing visibility on what\u2019s going to happen in the first part of 2015 and we believe that strength will continue from an industry perspective as well as from our perspective in the broader enterprise space through the first half of calendar 2015.", "Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Capital", "", "Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Next question is from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is open.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "Yes. Thanks for taking the questions, a couple as well. So, first of all, I want to go a little bit deeper in terms of the portfolio difference between you and Seagate. I think one of the things that we\u2019ve started this year is a pretty good adoption of your Helium drive. I think Seagate though had a very strong growth in their high capacity drives as well. Can you talk a little about the competitive landscape? What do you feel your share position is within these cloud and hyperscale guides? And then with that how you\u2019re seeing the adoption rate pickup with regard to the Helium drives?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "We\u2019re seeing strong momentum in terms of adoption of our Helium based drives not only in terms of 6 terabyte, but substantial interest in adoption of the 8 terabyte as well. And so, we feel very good about where we\u2019re positioned particularly with the hyperscale guide, it\u2019s a little bit more difficult to know exactly what our share position is? But we feel very comfortable with where we\u2019re at from a customer and from a competitive product perspective recognizing the fact that Seagate is a formidable competitor, but we feel very good about where we\u2019re positioned right now.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "Okay. And then as a follow-up, well, there is not a lot of questions right now with regard to MOFCOM. I think it\u2019s still obviously an important variable to consider in the model. So maybe if you can give us an update where you stand with regard to the dialogue with MOFCOM and is there any kind of updated views on expectations with regard to the timing of a decision on MOFCOM and as you\u2019re opinions or views change on a potential synergy opportunities being able to integrate Apache. Thank you.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "And so Aaron, no specific update that\u2019s any different than what I provided last quarter, our dialogue with MOFCOM continues. It continues to be constructive and it continues to be active. And so I was in China a couple of weeks ago and met with MOFCOM. And as I indicated, we continue to have a discussion about our situation, the process that they will use from a review perspective. I\u2019ll call parameters that they will use to evaluate our application. And so we although maybe a bit discouraged I guess you might say in terms of the timing. We are positive about our ongoing dialogue with China with the monopoly bureau.", "They have not provided any indication as to specific timing. I think one of the things that we have to recognize is that the whole separate remedy that was imposed was a new remedy. It was not something that they had done before. The reapplication to have it lifted is therefore by definition also a new process and an undefined process. And the Chinese are being very deliberate with that review. We respect that. And like I said, we may be a bit frustrated in terms of we certainly would like them to move faster, but at present we continue to be encouraged by the constructive nature of our dialogue.", "Aaron Rakers \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Next question comes from James Kisner with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "James Kisner \u2013 Jefferies Equity Research", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First on Helium, just wanted to understand if you had any capacity constraints and all were you able to meet all the demands for Helium drives?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "No capacity constraints related to our Helium-based drives.", "James Kisner \u2013 Jefferies Equity Research", "Great and just separately just mathematically there seems like you may be losing a little bit of share near-term on notebooks. Just could you comment on that as skepticism you\u2019re seeing is this just a quarter-to-quarter duration or what you think?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes, if you look at our share over the last several quarters, we have had the \u2013 we\u2019ve sort of been up and down maybe a point or two. If you recall last quarter or two quarters ago, so the June quarter, we gained two points in market share, this quarter we lost, I believe, about 170 basis points. So this tends to be the normal ebb and flow that occurs in our business from a share perspective.", "And as was indicated yesterday on our largest competitors call, they took some incremental business or were provided some incremental business in the gaming segment that drove a reasonable amount from what we can gather of their share increase and correspondingly drove the Lion\u2019s share of our market share decline. And also you can see that that was lower margins business and perpetuated itself and our respective financial performance.", "James Kisner \u2013 Jefferies Equity Research", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is Richard Kugele with Needham Company. Your line is open", "Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company", "Thank you and good afternoon, just a couple of questions. I guess first is close the loop on the settlement with Seagate. I assume that that payment came from offshore cash right and is there any change to how you\u2019re viewing your own capital deployment strategy to shareholders?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "So let me take this one. You\u2019re right; the settlement was paid out of offshore cash. And as a clarification also we distributed 50% of our free cash flow this quarter which is consistent with what we have done over the last two years. Now in the short run, exiting the recent arbitration payment from our calculation, we reserved to not exceeding our capital allocation target. And we expect our board to view this matter next week during its regular meeting and we will update you at that time.", "Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company", "Okay. And then actually in that vein, Olivier, how do you view the balance sheet and what do you think is the right type of cash balance to run the two operations as you move forward?", "Olivier Leonetti", "", "It\u2019s a question we\u2019re asked a lot. As you can see in our balance sheet, our cash balances are strong with about $1.2 billion of cash in our U.S. bank accounts and also a leverage ratio, which is pretty low at 4.7%. As Steve indicated earlier, we believe that the current allocation, 50% of free cash flow is a good balance to reward our shareholders today, but to reward our shareholders tomorrow by keep investing in the business. So we believe where we\u2019re today \u2013 we\u2019re looking at that, but we believe it\u2019s a balanced situation.", "Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company", "Okay. And then just lastly geographically. The Americas took up nicely while Asia was down at a percentage of the total. And I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s tied into your enterprise strength as the U.S. data centers deploying a lot of high capital. Is that how we should view it?", "Olivier Leonetti", "That would be part of it and also it\u2019s also a brand with strong \u2013 with a lot of that business being in the U.S. So in that regard there\u2019s a bit of seasonality playing into it.", "Richard Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company", "Okay. Excellent. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next is from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is open.", "Harlan Sur \u2013 JP Morgan", "Hi, good afternoon. Nice job on the quarterly execution. Your flash business obviously showed some nice acceleration here, up I think almost 40% sequentially, came in number one in SAS SSD. You\u2019ve got a competitive PCIe offering. From a product perspective what\u2019s driving the pickup series? Is it both staff and PCIe? Any color here would be appreciated. And maybe just a quick update on your SATA flash strategy.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "", "Sure. So the primary momentum that we saw in our business was related to our SAS business, and primarily driven by a refreshed product line and we\u2019re going to continue to see that momentum continue over the next few quarters. Relative to PCIe, we continue to be encouraged by that business. We have, as we indicated, had the HGST press event in September. We will have some refreshed products come out that we believe will be more competitive on the PCIe front and that will began to impact our financial results in the middle of next year.", "And then, right now on the SATA front, we do not have a competitive offering in that space. We\u2019re looking at it closely and there it is primarily an economic issue. We clearly could address it from a technical capability and customer perspective, but we also want to do it in a way that generates direct kind of returns for ourselves and our shareholders.", "Harlan Sur \u2013 JP Morgan", "Thanks for that, Steve. And then as a follow-up the enterprise flash is a big market $4 billion. So obviously a lot of room for the team to go from here and as you scale this business higher, do you feel comfortable in being able to cost effectively secure NAND flash supply because it does look like suppliers are going to be fairly tight as we move through next year and potentially through 2016.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "At present we do. We continue to have a very strong relationship with Intel through our joint development arrangements. We\u2019ve recently talked about how that development arrangement has been extended. I believe probably for \u2013 I may have my number here wrong, but I think it\u2019s third time that we\u2019ve extended that since. We originally entered into that arrangement back in 2008. We also announced back in September again at the HGST press event that we have expanded our NAND relationship to include Toshiba as well. So we\u2019re working with them on a strategic basis as well. And we\u2019ll continue to evaluate the nature of our relationships in that regard, but right now we feel very comfortable with where we\u2019re at.", "Harlan Sur \u2013 JP Morgan", "Great, thanks Steve.", "Operator", "Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.", "Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "Hi, Thanks for taking my question. If we look at even your Exabyte growth and even Seagate, but industry Exabyte is very strong in Q-over-Q. If we see similar trend in the disk drive industry, do you think industry could see tight situation over the next three to four quarters? And what will be the criteria if you were look at \u2013 if you\u2019re willing add any new capacity?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Sure, that\u2019s something that we continue to watch closely. At present, we do not believe \u2013 well, I need to say this way, we believe that we will have adequate supply from a component perspective to meet anticipated demand, but you raised a very good point when you\u2019re talking about these high capacity enterprise drives particularly our 7 Platters Helium-filled drive. We used a lot of components, I mean 14 heads and 7 in Platter.", "And so that is something that we\u2019re watching very closely. But right now, we do not anticipate that there will be a problem in meeting customer demand and nor that we believe that there will be any meaningful need to add capacity that will materially impact our stated CapEx plans. Reminding you that relative to CapEx, we have indicated that as of right now we\u2019re about 4% of revenue, we expect that that will continue at that level through the balance of this fiscal year.", "Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "Then a question on the hybrid side, Seagate kind of had a good \u2013 they shipped around three million hybrid client mainly in the quarter. Would you kind of consider the hybrid strategy at some point?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "No. We have a hybrid strategy, we continue to review it consistently. We are seeing some encouraging signs in that business, particularly in the client space. We are not from our perspective seeing much interest for hybrid based drives in the enterprise space. We think customers are interested in a disaggregated solution as supposed to an aggregated solution. And we\u2019re going to continue to evaluate what we\u2019re doing from a hybrid perspective, but don\u2019t from a product perspective, from a performance perspective and from an economic perspective. We are bit more muted with regards to our enthusiasm as it relates to hybrid offerings.", "Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "Got it. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.", "Jayson Noland \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc", "Okay, okay, great, thank you. I wanted to ask about join technology partnerships, Seagate announced one recently with a cloud service provider in China, recognized you guys probably have these. But just have an announcement formally, how popular are these Steve and should we expect to see more of them going forward.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "The answer is yes. We should expect to see more partnership kind of activity. I don\u2019t quite know how to dimension how popular they are. But with the ecosystem changing so much and it\u2019s changing in some cases in ways that are harder to predict. I mean there\u2019s a lot of evolving technologies. You\u2019ve seen us make some, and these are smaller dollars within the whole grand scheme of things. Make some investments in some storage technology related companies, enter into other kinds of partnership arrangements.", "And so that kind of activity will undoubtedly increase. As we look to expand our footprint, expand the way that we can add value and clearly many of these companies given where we sit within the storage world the view us as attractive partners to work with as well.", "So I think that we will continue to see that kind of activity expanding for ourselves and for others in the industry.", "Jayson Noland \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc", "Okay. A follow-up there on the financial model. As you head down that path expanding your footprint in the systems business, should that drive gross margin up and investment on the OpEx line up over time?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "", "We are not specifically indicating that from a model perspective. I mean, we\u2019re going to continue to keep an eye on that. We have been incrementally investing as well as reinvesting in terms of OpEx and shifting things around. But generally speaking, our OpEx levels have stayed relatively consistent from a percentage of revenue perspective.", "And then, in terms of gross margin, the opportunities that we are looking at pursuing, whether they be accretive on the gross margin line or accretive on the operating income line, I mean that\u2019s clearly what we\u2019re trying to do is figure out how we can add more value from a customer perspective and if we do our jobs right best to translate to improve the economics on our income statement as well.", "Jayson Noland \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc", "", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next is from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open.", "Mehdi Hosseini \u2013 Susquehanna International Group", "Yes, thanks for taking my question. Steve, you talked about the enterprise demand strengthening in the first half of 2015. How about traditional notebook and the consumer desktop? Any comment there and to that extent if you could also discuss the pricing trend that you see beyond the December quarter. Thank you.", "", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Sure. Relative to the PC market, both in terms of notebook and desktop, and I\u2019ll address them together rather than individually. We see the PC market as I would characterize it as stable. We\u2019ve seen in terms of IDC numbers that have been published or industry forecast that have been published is PC market declining in the low single-digits. We see that continuing. We don\u2019t see either an acceleration or a deceleration from that perspective. So I would characterize the PC market as stable, which means that it\u2019s certainly much better than it has been. And there\u2019s certainly no slowdown or it\u2019s not worsening and that\u2019s a good thing from our perspective.", "Relative to the March quarter or the first half of 2015, I would indicate that our visibility there is not as great as it is in the enterprise market. And so, at this point, we would simply expect that we would see the normal seasonal decline that we traditionally see for a December quarter going into March, end of the first half of the year. So that\u2019s the way we see it right now.", "Mehdi Hosseini \u2013 Susquehanna International Group", "Great. And then any color on the pricing\u2026", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Pricing has been within our expectation, nothing nearly notable to call out.", "Mehdi Hosseini \u2013 Susquehanna International Group", "Got it, thank you.", "Operator", "", "Rob Cihra with Evercore. Your line is open.", "Rob Cihra \u2013 Evercore Partners", "", "Hi, thank you very much. I guess one \u2013 my question is a follow-up. On the enterprise SSD obviously a nice growth there. Do you had \u2013 I think Steve you\u2019d reiterated the plan to be \u2013 or the goal to be accretive following sTec and the Virident acquisitions in early calendar 2015. That would imply I would assume that business moving to become meaningfully more of a contributor to the business given the fact that the HGST, Intel SaaS, SSD is still the bulk. I mean is that the case or is that more of a cost cut gets you to the equation. What gets you the equation, I assuming it\u2019s\u2026", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Well, so the primary dependency is ongoing revenue growth. We are investing a certain sum of money from an OpEx perspective to make sure that we have the product \u2013 the products out there from an industry perspective but the primary dependency is to that accretive statement is ongoing momentum from a customer acceptance and revenue perspective. And we are comfortable that we\u2019re on the path that we need to be on to make the statement that we expect to be accretive on the first part of 2015.", "Rob Cihra \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Okay, great. And if I guess a quick follow-up on the Helium drives. I mean are they enough contributor yet to actually make a sort of meaningful impact on your ASPs on the blended ASP in enterprise. I am assuming so, but are they big enough yet to do that? Thanks.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "I mean that really I would paint in the context that our capacity enterprise business was a meaningful contributor to our ASP lift in this past quarter. I don\u2019t know if I want to call out the helium filled drives specifically, but it\u2019s beginning to make certainly a much more meaningful impact. I mean we\u2019re very pleased with where we\u2019re at with the adoption of our helium platform. And not only that I\u2019m very encouraged by customer reaction or anticipation to volume production in the 8 terabyte as well.", "Rob Cihra \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Right, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Mark Miller with Noble financial Capital. Your line is open.", "Mark Miller \u2013 Noble Financial Capital Markets", "", "Well, thank you for taking my question. We talked earlier about the tightening NAND Flash environment possibility. And I\u2019m just wondering at one point there was a big campaign for relative to competitors who have internal Flash supply as Flash prices increase?", "Olivier Leonetti", "I\u2019m not sure I didn\u2019t follow your question Mark.", "Mark Miller \u2013 Noble Financial Capital Markets", "Well, if the flash prices go up, I mean that\u2019s a percent that you build materials for your drive and I\u2019m just wondering what \u2013 how sensitive are you in terms of flash price increases, in term of your margins or your ability to transfer that to your customers?", "Olivier Leonetti", "Yes, I\u2019m not that concerned about that market at this point. I mean we\u2019ve been in the Enterprise SST business for a while, we\u2019ve gone through some ups and down from a pricing perspective, we certainly have a history of dealing with that in terms of variability and in terms of component cost on our base drive business historically. There\u2019s something that we have to watch and keep our eye on, but I\u2019m comfortable that we\u2019ll be able to deal with whatever variability exists from a component pricing perspective as it related to flash.", "Mark Miller \u2013 Noble Financial Capital Markets", "And just wondering it appears that you\u2019re kind of projecting flat overall drag kind of for next year is that same reason of all?", "Olivier Leonetti", "We haven\u2019t provided a specific forecast for next year stand. What we have indicated is that we expect the TAM for rotating magnetic storage to increase at a low-single digits level from an unit perspective.", "Mark Miller \u2013 Noble Financial Capital Markets", "And I apologize for this extra but just a housekeeping question, what was your forecast for SG&A and R&D for next quarter spending?", "Olivier Leonetti", "As we said \u2013 as I said in my remarks about $600 million.", "Mark Miller \u2013 Noble Financial Capital Markets", "$600 million so that\u2019s down significantly from this current quarter, is that correct?", "Olivier Leonetti", "Correct for two reasons we had one addition week of OpEx last quarter, we had 14 week. And then the other one off incentive payment as well.", "Mark Miller \u2013 Noble Financial Capital Markets", "Okay. I\u2019ve Mr. \u2013 the incentive payment. Thank you.", "Olivier Leonetti", "No problem.", "Operator", "Ben Reitzes with Barclay\u2019s. Your line is open.", "Benjamin Alexander Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.", "Hi, thanks a lot. Steve I wanted to ask you kind of a little more new arms around two things, you already touched on it. In terms of the December quarter guidance with the loss of the extra week, your guidance looks pretty flat up actually if I were to assume that its probably impossible to know what the extra week gave you in the quarter but if you take something off it looks pretty flattish and you were saying down. So I just wanted to see what the extra week was in your guidance and then I just had a quick follow-up?", "Stephen D. Milligan", "Yes Ben you are right it\u2019s a little bit difficult to calibrate exactly what the impact of the extra week was last quarter. Also not to further confuse things, the December quarter is always a little bit tricky. In the sense that you have Christmas and how much activity actually takes place in the last week. So you could argue that at the 12-week quarter in the sense in terms of the December quarter. The reality of things is that most of our business is reliance shares, OEM based on and such not as transactional.", "So I don\u2019t really think that the 14th week had a material impact for us we do believe that is probably slightly accretive if we were to guesstimate, but talking about December quarter I mean there will be some moderations from an overall demand perspective that we think that the demand environment as on balance. It\u2019s pretty good. It\u2019s not great, certainly not bad. But it continues to be generally relatively steady.", "Benjamin Alexander Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.", "Okay, great. And then I just open you could clarify one other thing that you said around 50% of free cash flow billing to shareholders and the other 50% joining reserve for potential opportunities. I was just wondering if you could hold that comment around potential opportunities. Did you mean more on the enterprise and flat side or do you if there is a way to holding that I mean it\u2019s really hard to say what you are going to go out and buy into, but if you are the specific, do you see it more in consumer enterprise or however you want to specify that would be great. Thanks.", "Stephen D. Milligan", "There are two principle opportunities that we think where we our position from a product and customer perspective to expand our footprint. One, I\u2019m clearly as in the enterprise space. If you want to call that moving us to stock and a way that is complementary to what many of our \u2013 what much of our customers are doing. And also, we do think that we have incremental opportunity in the consumer or prosumer or smaller, medium business opportunities from a storage perspective as well. So that\u2019s would be the two principle areas that we would be focusing on.", "Benjamin Alexander Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.", "", "Great, thanks so much.", "", "Stephen D. Milligan", "", "So thank you again for joining us today. In closing, I want to thank all of our employees and suppliers for their commitment and outstanding execution and our customers for their continued business.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jay Iyer. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Tanisha and good afternoon everyone. With me on the call are Sanjay Mehrotra, President and CEO and Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President of Administration and CFO. In a moment, we will hear remarks from both of them, followed by Q&A.", "Before we begin, please note that any non-GAAP financial measures discussed during this call, as defined by the SEC in Regulation G, will be reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.", "That reconciliation is now available along with supplemental schedules on our website at sandisk.com/ir. Please note that non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation tables for all applicable guidance will also be posted on our website. This guidance is exclusive of any one-time transactions and does not reflect the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures, or similar transactions that may be completed after January 21, 2015.", "In addition, during our call today we will make forward-looking statements that refer to expectations, projections, or other future events.

SanDisk assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements which speak as of today.", "Before I turn the call over to Sanjay, I\u2019d like to inform you that our first quarter earnings conference call is being planned for April 15. We are also planning to host our 2015 Investor Day meeting on May 13 in Milpitas California. Please mark your calendars.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Sanjay.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon everyone. 2014 was a record year for revenue and non-GAAP earnings and our business generated strong cash flows. We are pleased to have returned more than 100% of our 2014 free cash flow to our investors through our capital return program. We successfully drove our portfolio make shift towards high value solutions during the year with total SSD revenue contributing 29% of 2014 revenue up from 19% of 2013 revenue.", "Moving to the details of the business we are disappointed with our fourth quarter execution. As we indicated in the October conference call, our inventory levels were extremely lean exiting the third quarter and were anticipated to become even leaner throughout the fourth quarter. We over estimated our ability to service our customers demand variability with our low levels of inventory creating supply short falls in certain products.", "Additionally, within the fourth quarter unplanned maintenance activities in our Yokkaichi fab operations as well as lower yield on certain memory dye [ph] led to unexpected reduction in production output. The combination of lean inventory and reduced memory output made our ability to meet our customer demand even more challenging during the seasonally strong period.", "These factors impacted our business most notably in our retail and iNAND product lines. Within retail, the late timing of supply availability resulted in large sales opportunities. Within iNAND demand for our previous generation product fell more rapidly than forecasted by our customers, while we had limited ability to service demands for our newer products due to supply constraints. We are taking corrective measures to mitigate the recurrence of these events in the future to ensure that we can consistently meet our customers\u2019 expectations. It is clear that one of our top operational priorities for 2015 is to rebuild our inventory levels which we expect to be restored to normal levels by midyear.", "In embedded, in the second half of 2014 we estimate that the smartphone market consumed more embedded flash based on X3 NAND technology than ever before, and we are leading the industry and advancing the usage of X3 in embedded products with our seventh generation X3 technologies. Over the course of this year with our strong roadmap we expect to win designs for our embedded X3 Solutions at multiple OEM customers with strong production ramp in the second half of 2015.", "Beyond the smartphone and tablet markets, we are pleased with the traction we are seeing for our embedded and removable solution with customers in the connected home, automotive and content delivery markets. ", "Turning to enterprise SSDs, revenue grew on both the sequential and the year-over-year basis during the fourth quarter, this full year revenue nearly doubling on a year-over-year basis. The fourth quarter enterprise SSD revenue was driven by continuing strength in the fas SSDs and the significant increase in revenue from sales of CloudSpeed enterprise SATA products to hyperscale customers. We have largely completed our overall Fusion-io integration and we are excited about the opportunities ahead with the broadest portfolio of enterprise SSD products in the industry.", "We made solid progress in moving the Fusion-io go-to-market strategy to an OEM centric model and enhancing sales force productivity. We continue to expect that our enterprise solutions revenue will achieve $1 billion in 2015. Our client SSDs completed a very strong year in 2014 with 36% year-over-year growth with strong penetration in both OEM and retail markets. Retail existence of our X3-based SanDisk Ultra II SSD continues to be solid. With our OEM customers we expanded our presence further with our 1Y nanometer X2 SSDs.", "Corporate adoption of our client SSDs continues to accelerate, driven by an increasing attach rate of SSD in notebooks. I am pleased to note that qualification for our 1Y nanometer X3 SSDs is nearing completion with multiple OEM customers. One headwind for our client SSDs however is that a major customer had decided to move away from our client SSD solution starting in Q1. Taking this into consideration, we estimate our 2015 total SSD sales enterprise and client solutions combined as a percentage of revenue to remain similar to the 29% revenue mix in 2014.", "We expect that mix to be driven by significantly higher sales in enterprise, partially offset by a decline in client SSD sales. Driven by market growth and continued share gain and corporate PC platforms, we anticipate that our client SSD revenue will grow again starting in 2016.", "In retail we do not see any material changes to the demand in the market place although there could be pockets of demand weakness in certain regions like EMEA due to macroeconomic factors. We expect our retail channel eventually have the number one flash NAND in the world to continue to be a solid contributor to our overall business and profitability in 2015.", "In manufacturing, the output from our wafers fabs was below our expectations for the fourth quarter and the full year for the reasons I described earlier with the full years bit supply growth in 2014 increasing by 20% from 2013 at the low end of our original 20% to 30% growth range estimate.", "The primary driver of the low bit growth was the high mix of 19-nanometer wafers in order to service our OEM customers. The ramp of our 15-nanometer technology is proceeding well, with cost crossover that 1Y technology achieved late in the fourth quarter of 2014. We expect a strong production ramp of 15-nanometer throughout 2015 with the mix reaching 50% of our sales in the second half of the year.", "We are now utilizing 15-nanometer X3 technology in retail products and in the first quarter of 2015 we will begin sampling the new technology in embedded applications. Our 3D NAND technology development continues to make good progress and we remain on track to begin pilot production in the second half of 2015 with volume production targeted in 2016. We remain confident that our 3D NAND Memory products in production in 2016 will be competitive that those offered by others in the market at that time.", "From a NAND industry standpoint, our estimate for 2015 supply bit growth is in the range of 35% to 40% and we continue to expect a healthy industry supply demand environment. As we have previously mentioned, we will be implementing a 5% expansion to our wafer capacity in the first half of 2015 and this will increase our captive wafer capacity to approximately 3 million wafers in the second half of the year. We expect that our wafer capacity expansion along with an increasing mix of 15-nanometer technology and an increasing mix of X3 will bring our captive supply bit growth for 2015 to the high end of the industry bit growth range.", "To conclude, we have focussed on improving our supply and product availability and we will continue managing the business for profitable growth and strong cash flows. In 2105, while our revenue will be challenged in the first half of the year, we expect to return to solid growth in the second half of the year, driven by continuing share gains in enterprise storage and accelerating momentum in embedded solutions. We look forward to bringing greater value to a broader customer base with exciting new products and further extending our position as a pre eminent supplier of innovative storage solutions. We remain excited about the future profits of the company and plan to continue our strong capital return program.", "With that I will turn over the call to Judy for the financial review and outlook.", "Judy Bruner", "Thank you, Sanjay. For the full year 2014, we grew our revenue by 7% and our non-GAAP EPS by 5% including the dilutive impact of the Fusion-io acquisition. While these total results were quite strong, we are disappointed in our fourth quarter performance and our first half of 2015 will be focussed on recovering from the current headwinds in our supply and in our client SSD business. We expect that in the second half of 2015 we will return to year-over-year topline growth and delivering non-GAAP operating profit within our target financial model of 25% to 30% of revenue.", "I\u2019ll take you through some details of our Q4 results and then discuss 2015 expectations in more detail. Our Q4 revenue was approximately flat, both sequentially and year-over-year and was comprised of 69% commercial and 31% retail compared to the year ago quarter which was 62% commercial and 38% retail.", "Our retail revenue was down 2% sequentially and down 18% year-over-year. Typically the fourth quarter has been the strongest quarter of the year for our retail revenue. While we expect that some year-over-year decline in Q4 retail revenue due to the contraction of the imaging market, we believe the market did grow sequentially while our revenue was constrained by our limited supply and low channel inventory levels.", "In addition, there were some pockets of pricing weakness in EMEA and APAC. On a regional basis we generated sequential retail revenue growth in North America where we were better able to meet the timing requirements of customer demand and this was offset by a decline in revenue in Europe and APAC where our supply constraints were more pronounced. ", "Our commercial revenue was flat sequentially and up 12% year-over-year. Within our commercial revenue on a sequential basis our enterprise SSD revenue grew strongly while our client SSD revenue was down modestly primarily due to seasonality and anticipated supply constraints. Our combined SSD revenue increased to 31% of our total revenue in the fourth quarter up from 27% in Q3. Our embedded revenue grew sequentially by 10% with the decline in revenue from iNAND solution and strong growth in custom embedded revenue.", "As Sanjay described our iNAND revenue was below our original expectations due to a faster than anticipated decline in demand for our older generation products combined with supply constraints for our newer iNAND products. Finally, within our commercial revenue sales of wafers and compliance were down sequentially as we prioritize supply for value added solutions and our license and royalty revenue grew slightly on a sequential basis.", "Turning to a few metrics for the fourth quarter, on a sequential basis our gigabytes sold increased 4% and ASP per gigabyte declined by 4%. On a year-over-year basis, our fourth quarter gigabyte sold increased to 32% and ASP per gigabyte declined 24%.", "For the full year 2014 our revenue bit growth was 36% in comparison to the 20% supply bit growth that Sanjay described. This difference in bit growth left our inventory levels too lean and we are working to rebuild our inventory levels in the first half of 2015.", "Turning to gross margin, for 2014 our blended ASP per gigabyte declined by 22% and our all in cost per gigabyte also declined by 22%. Our full year non-GAAP gross margin was 48% in the middle of our target financial model of 45% to 51% and up 70 basis points from 2013. In the fourth quarter our non-GAAP gross margin decreased sequentially from 49% to 45% below our previous forecast of 47% to 49%. There were three primary factors that contributed to the sequential decline in gross margin and the miss from our forecast.", "First was the lower mix of retail revenue which carries a higher than average gross margin. The lower retail mix was driven primarily by supply constraints. Second, as Sanjay previously discussed, we experienced faster than expected demand reduction for certain end-of-life products which made available trailing edge technology node X2 NAND.", "In an attempt to meet customer demand timing requirements we used this older node X2 NAND in products that would normally use more current node X3 NAND memory. This inefficient memory usage as well as the lower fab output put upward pressure on our memory cost. Third, we took inventory reserves related to a faster than expected decline in demand for certain end-of-life OEM products as well as for our ULLtraDIMM product which has become the subject of a core injunction stemming from litigation to which we are not a party. The yen rate in our fourth quarter cost of sale was 102.5 compared to 101 in Q3 which resulted in a small positive impact to gross margin.", "Including all these factors our fourth quarter cost per gigabyte increased sequentially by 3% compared to the 4% decrease in ASP per gigabyte. Our Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses decreased sequentially by $12 million driven by a reduction in restructuring expenses related primarily to Fusion-io integration activities.", "Our non-GAAP operating margin was 24% in Q4 and 28% for the full year inclusive of Fusion-io related restructuring charges. Other income and expense was a net expense in Q4 due to charges related to the spin-out of the ioControl business now known as NexGen.", "Our non-GAAP tax rate declined in the fourth quarter due to the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. For the full year our non-GAAP tax rate was 30.9% and the GAAP tax rate was 32.3%. Our diluted share count came down on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis driven by strong share repurchases. In Q4 we spent approximately $500 million on the repurchase of over 5.5 million shares.", "Q4 cash flow from operations was $488 million bringing full year cash flow from operations to $1.7 billion. Our fourth quarter free cash flow was $476 million including the net return of $55 million of cash from the flash venture. For 2014, our free cash flow was 1.5 billion and our capital return program totalled 103% of free cash flow. During the year, we paid 235 million in dividends and repurchased 14.3 million shares resulting in a net reduction in shares outstanding of 9.5 million shares.", "Our share of flash venture fab investments during Q4 was $209 million, and non-fab capital investments were $67 million, bringing 2014 gross capital investments to approximately $1.15 billion.", "Our 2014 capital investments were funded primarily by flash venture working capital and secondarily by flash venture operating leases. Our cash outlay for capital investments in 2014 was $207 million or 18% of the gross investment.", "Our inventory ended the year at $698 million, the lowest level in both dollars and weeks of supply since late 2011 when our products mix was very different and our revenue was much lower. The longest cycle time for SSDs coupled with the increased breadth of our product portfolio has led to a need for higher inventory weeks of supply where as we currently have the lowest weeks of supply since Q3 of 2011.", "Turning to our expectations for 2015 we will be rebuilding our inventory buffers in order to meet the needs of our customers and accommodate normal variability in product demand. In order to restore our inventory health, we believe 2015 revenue bit growth can be no more than 30% inclusive of non captive inventory in comparison to our expected captive supply bit growth at the high end of the anticipated industry growth of 35% to 40%.", "As Sanjay described, we expect our client SSD revenue to decline due to a large customer moving away from our solution. The key product areas where we expect revenue growth in 2015 are enterprise and embedded solutions. In total we expect our revenue to experience a year-on-year decline in both the first and second quarters and return to year-on-year growth in the second half of 2015.", "Our first quarter revenue forecast is $1,400 million to $1,450 million. And our 2015 revenue forecast is $6.5 billion to $6.8 billion. In terms of gross margin, the first quarter will continue to be impacted by using an inefficient memory mix as well as some extra non captive memory. We will also start to incur some start up cost in cost of sales related to our Malaysia assembly and test factory which will begin production in the middle of the year.", "These factors plus the sequentially lower revenue level will put pressure on gross margins. Offsetting these factors will be a more favourable yen rate of approximately 108 in our Q1 cost of sales based primarily on Q4 purchase rates and previous hedges. In total, we expect Q1 non-GAAP gross margin to be similar to that of the fourth quarter or approximately 45%.", "We expect gross margins to improve across the second through the fourth quarter based on improving inventory levels, product transitions to 1Y and 1Z, a higher usage of X3 memory, increasing enterprise revenue mix and a more favourable yen rate assuming the yen to dollar exchange rate stays at current level.", "We expect that the gross margin improvement will be more concentrated in the second half of the year. We forecast our full year 2015 non-GAAP gross margin to be 47% to 48% in the middle of our target financial model of 45% to 51% with Q3 and Q4 non-GAAP gross margin in the upper half of our model.", "We expect non-GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter to be between $365 million and $375 million and for the full year we expect our non-GAAP expenses to be approximately $1.5 billion. This is somewhat higher than our target financial model of 20% to 21% of revenue as we continue to make key investments.", "In terms of non-GAAP operating margin we expect to be solidly in our 25% to 30% target financial model in the second half of the year. Our forecast for non-GAAP other income and expense is approximately $15 million of income for the year and we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain about the same at 31%.", "Our 2015 capital investment is estimated at approximately $1.4 billion including a 5% capacity add and the addition of a 3D NAND pilot line. We expect cash usage to be between $300 million and $400 million for these capital investments with the remainder funded by flash venture of working capital and leases. We will manage our business with a focus on achieving our target financial model for free cash flow of 15% of revenue. And we will continue a strong share repurchase program which should lead to diluted shares coming down again in 2015.", "In summary, we expect to strengthen the business across 2015 with inventory rebuilding in the first half of 2015 and strong roadmaps and customer relationships in place, we look forward to a strong second half of the year.", "We expect full year 2015 revenue to be similar to slightly higher than in 2014 driven by growth and enterprise and embedded solutions revenue. We expect to deliver healthy profit margins and be solidly within our target financial model of 25% to 30% non-GAAP operating margin by the second half of the year. We intend to spend at least 100% of our 2015 free cash flow on our capital return program this year.", "We will now take your questions.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Judy. Thank you, Sanjay. Tanisha, can you poll floor for questions please, and if I can ask the callers to ask one and a brief follow-up.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Q - Joe Moore", "Great. Thank you. I wondered if you could start with the lost SSD win that you would had. Can you just kind of walk us through, is it was there reason that you lost that and then what\u2019s the profit impact from that? My sense was that SSD from a gross margin basis wasn\u2019t that much different than the rest of the business. But can you just talk specifically to that impact?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "I will start with this and then Judy will comment on the gross margin aspect. So, we of course cannot comment on the business decisions by our customer. But what I will tell you is that SanDisk roadmap of our SSD solutions is very strong, very solid and actually SanDisk continues to gain substantial momentum across the broad range of client [ph] PC platforms.", "When you look at corporate PC demand, you know, we\u2019re getting strong design win. Of course this particular loss of business \u2013 customer with respect to them moving away from our SSD solution, we had a large share, so this impacts our revenue in 2015 timeframe. But we are continuing to have strong momentum with corporate PC platform sales.", "Judy Bruner", "And Joe, in terms of gross margin impact you know we\u2019ve said before that client SSD business tends to have a gross margin that\u2019s less than the corporate average. And so, by client SSD business shrinking, you could say that that has some positive impact on the blended gross margin. However, at the same time I expect that embedded mix in our business is going to increase and that also tends to have a less than corporate average gross margin.", "So I view the change in mix between client SSD and embedded to be roughly a wash in terms of mix effect on the year. The key mix effect as we move across 2015 is going to be the increasing mix of enterprise which will have a positive effect on gross margins.", "Joe Moore", "Okay.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Joe, did you have follow-up?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.", "John Pitzer", "Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. Sanjay, I guess I\u2019m just trying to better understand sort of inherently your mix strategy, because all throughout 2014 you made strides in mixing up the business as you talked about and yet if I look at fourth quarter earnings year-over-year, they are down about 20%. So I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what is the mix strategy and are you still holding to your target of enterprise SSD being over a $1 billion for the fiscal year 2015?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Absolutely, we are holding on to our strategy. I believe our strategy is very sound and working well for us. Continuing to focus on increasing the mix of high value solutions and as part of that as I mentioned in my remarks, enterprise SSD solution they will certainly achieve a $1 billion for us in 2015 for our revenue and we\u2019ll continue to grow in that space in the future as well.", "We have previously articulated our goal to be a number one market share leader, market shareholder in enterprise SSDs in the future and we are absolutely well on our way in that regard.", "John Pitzer", "Perfect.", "Judy Bruner", "Yes. I might just\u2026", "John Pitzer", "Yes, I\u2019m sorry.", "Judy Bruner", "I might just add that in terms of the mix effect of our business. Absolutely the enterprise mix is increasing and that has positive impact on margins. But if you think about it on a year-over-year basis the retail mix has come down some and that has some offsetting effect as we have mentioned several times. But as we move through 2015 we really believe that our gross margin is going to accelerate across the year and we believe as I said that we\u2019ll be in the upper half of our target financial model in the second half of 2015.", "John Pitzer", "And then as a follow-on on Joe\u2019s question, the client SSD OEM customer that you lost, I know you won\u2019t mention them by name, but is that the same customer that you maintain 19 nanometer capacity for \u2013 and if it is doesn\u2019t that kind of go to whether or not you guys will be more aggressive driving mix towards what\u2019s optimal for your company more so than what\u2019s optimal for your customers?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "In terms of 19-nanometer capacity, as we mentioned some of that was in our iNAND business for some of the customer forecast that were there. And those customer forecast for those 19-nanometer iNAND product dropped as the customer itself was going through certain transitions of their platforms. And that resulted in some of the details that Judy described earlier in her remarks as well as resulted in iNAND shortfall in revenue in the fourth quarter.", "Of course, we\u2019ve also use 19-nanometer production primarily for our enterprise products, enterprise solutions and enterprise customers tend to stay on prior generation nodes for longer period of time.", "And as our enterprise business grew during the course of the year that\u2019s what made us bring in more 19-nanometer supply during 2015 to meet the requirements of some of our OEM customers. And that resulted in some of the bit growth being 20% versus the prior [ph] expectations that I\u2019d mentioned earlier as well.", "So overall, we of course continue to work on transitioning our customers to the new technology nodes, but older technology nodes are required to be held for OEM parts of the business. In this particular case it was more iNAND and enterprise solutions that I mentioned.", "John Pitzer", "Thank you, guys.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, John. Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Mehdi Hosseini", "Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. Sanjay, when we look at the $1 billion target for enterprise SSD, how should we think about the Fusion-io contribution? And what would it be if you didn\u2019t have constrained with shipping ULLtraDIMM products and I have a follow-up?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Regarding ULLtraDIMM itself our expectations in 2015 are fairly small as you know in terms of revenue, as you know it\u2019s a very new product category and continuing to engage with the customer base. But clearly ULLtraDIMM product category as we mentioned does get impacted by the injunction that we currently have. And that injunction would have to be lifted soon. I mean, the legal matter would have to be dissolve soon in order for ULLtraDIMM momentum to begin again, otherwise the sales of ULLtraDIMM would get impacted.", "Regarding the fusion-io part of the business, as we had expected before, the fusion-io part of the business is not at the run rate that it was pre-acquisition and therefore we expected during the time of the acquisition as well. However we have made a strong progress in terms of integration. We have an excellent team, strong roadmap for fusion-io product. And we expect in Q1 to have sequential growth in that part of the business.", "And certainly as part of our $1 billion goal in 2015 for enterprise SSD solutions, fusion-io revenue will be a significant contributor there as well. You will recall that $1 billion goal at our last May Investor Day was actually our 2016 goal and we pulled it in to 2015 once we acquired fusion-io, because now we have a broad base of enterprise storage solution as a broadest portfolio in the industry between fab, SATA, PCIe getting complemented now by our software capabilities and leading to some exciting solutions possibilities. So really of these on our enterprise business positioning us in a unique and differentiated position leading to $1 billion goal for the year for us in enterprise.", "Mehdi Hosseini", "And then follow-up for Judy, how we should we think about the cost down through ramping the 1Z on 15-nanometer versus the impact of currency especially as we look into Q2 and Q3 assuming that the yen were to stay at the current level?", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. We expect that our costs down on per gigabyte basis in 2015 will be in that 15% to 25% range that we\u2019ve talked about many times. It was 22% as I said for 2014. And if you think about the key factors in 2015 will definitely get good costs down from 1Z as well as from an increasing usage of X3 memory across the year.", "And then, we of course will also have mix effects as the enterprise portion or for mix of our business growth that will tempt to dampen the cost reduction across the year. So that\u2019s built into our expectation. And yes, it is our current expectation that we\u2019ll get a benefit from the yen and that\u2019s in there as well.", "Mehdi Hosseini", "Thank you.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Mehdi. Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Freedman with RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Doug Freedman", "Hi, Judy and Sanjay. Thanks for taking by question. If I look at your full year guidance, I\u2019m a little confused. It looks like at the midpoints we\u2019re looking about 2% revenue growth. But yet you\u2019re talking about close to 30% bit growth shipments. That would imply about 28% ASP erosion. That\u2019s seems a bit high to me especially given the commentary that you should be seeing your bit selling for a high mix shift. So if you could walk me through a little bit how we\u2019re getting to the revenue guidance and the bit growth in. I know you don\u2019t talk about ASPs, but if you could maybe back into the mix that you expect to be driven that it would be helpful?", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. So, you\u2019re right. We don\u2019t talk about specific ASP assumptions, but I think if you do the math with a bit growth, the revenue bit growth of say, 30%, you can easily get to some type of blended overall price decline similar to 2014. And 2014 we believe was in healthy balance overall for the year.", "2014 also had mix effect on our blended pricing and 2015 will also have mix effect on our pricing. I was just talking relative to cost about the growth in the enterprise mix of our business and as the enterprise mix of our business grows that will tend to dampen the blended price decline. But at the same time as the mix of our business shift from to be less client SSD and more embedded that mix shift will put some acceleration on that blended price decline statistic.", "It doesn\u2019t necessarily change the gross margin, but client SSDs tend to sell at a higher price per gigabyte than do the embedded solutions. So there\u2019s a lot of mix effects in our assumption, but we believe that the \u2013 our outlook at this point is for a very healthy industry environment in 2015 and that\u2019s assumed in our revenue forecast.", "Doug Freedman", "Okay. I still have some more questions on this, but I\u2019ll ask them after the call around fall back. If I could maybe get a little bit of color on your expectations for the custom embedded segment of your business and maybe what percentage of mix you\u2019re expecting there verse in 2016 versus 2015? And thanks again for taking my questions.", "Judy Bruner", "Well, we really don\u2019t breakout the embedded portion of our mix, but we expect that we will see growth and very good growth in embedded in 2015, and I expect that we will see growth in various parts of our embedded revenue. You asked about 2016 and 2015, but I think you were probably referring to 2015 and 2014.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Timothy Arcuri", "Thank you. I had two questions, first of all, you\u2019ve been very clear on this year basically it sounds like you\u2019re increasing captive bit supply just a little bit from the middle of 30 to 40 range to the high end of the range. My question is on 2016, because at Analyst Day you gave the same sort of up 30 to 40 number for the industry for 2016, which you said, you\u2019d back to sort of under growing at say, up 25 to 35, but now since you\u2019re actually picking up a bit more captive bit growth this year and inventory, it should be normalize this year. Are you similarly going to grow your captive bit supply faster in 2016? Thanks.", "Judy Bruner", "Yes. We\u2019re not really prepared to give a specific captive supply bit growth percentage yet for 2016. But I will tell you that with hindsight we wish we would have grown our captive supply bit growth somewhat more in 2014 and so we\u2019ll clearly take that into account as we look at our plans for 2016. But we remain very prudent in terms of our capacity growth and our supply planning. That is not changing. That\u2019s a main stay of how we run our business.", "Timothy Arcuri", "Got it, Judy. Thanks so much. And then just \u2013 I had a question on inventories. If I calculate it right, it looks like it came down about week and a half on a petabyte basis? And you said before I think you want to be in the 10-week range something like that. Are you going to be able to get to 10 weeks exiting Q1 or is it more should we think about it you going to \u2013 you sort of exit midyear in that range?", "Judy Bruner", "We exited 2014 at about 8 weeks of inventory. And you are right; I have said in the past that we need to be at least to 10 weeks. In fact the right range I believe is 10 to 12 weeks. By the way I used to talk a number of years ago about the right range for inventory being 10 to 12 weeks. And since that time the complexity of the mix of our business and the cycle time as we have grown the SSDs has increased.", "At the same time we\u2019ve made efficiency gains in our processes and so when you net those two together I still believe that 10 to 12 weeks is the right range for our inventory to best manage our business. I don\u2019t expect that we will be there at the end of Q1. I really believe it will take until the middle of the year for us to get to the low end of that range.", "Timothy Arcuri", "Great. Thank you.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Tim. Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee.", "Vijay Rakesh", "Hi, guys. Just going back to the yen you said 108 [ph] for the March quarter, what\u2019s your yen hedging for Q2, Q3 or have you hedged that far out?", "Judy Bruner", "We have not placed any hedges for 2015 for our yen wafer purchases. It is \u2013 we monitor this consistently and it may \u2013 there may come a day where we decide that we\u2019re going to place some hedges, but to-date we have not placed any hedges for 2015 wafer purchases.", "Vijay Rakesh", "Got it. So, going back to the enterprise SSD side, you said that mostly 19-nanometer on enterprise today. When does that move to 15-nanometer in enterprise? That\u2019s it. Thanks.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Toward the end of this year is when we plan to start shipping in enterprise SSD our next generation memory technology nodes.", "Vijay Rakesh", "Thank you.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Vijay. Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.", "Craig Ellis", "Thanks for taking the question. Sanjay, looking beyond the near term issue with the large customer on the consumer SSD side of the business, can you talk about things that you see from a program standpoint to a product standpoint that give you the confidence that that business can get back to growth and when would it be expected to get back to year-on-year growth?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "In terms of the consumer SSD business?", "Craig Ellis", "That\u2019s right.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Yes. So, consumer SSD business actually in terms of corporate PC platforms with vast majority \u2013 almost all of the ecosystem of customers that is there for those platforms, we are gaining share except for this large customer where we mentioned the situation in our prepared remarks. So we are making very good progress. We have excellent roadmap there. And we throughout the course of the year we plan to be gaining share in that particular part of the business. And 2016 is where I would expect on a year-over-year basis client SSD business to return to revenue growth.", "Craig Ellis", "Thank you. And then the follow-up.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "But in terms of other customers we\u2019ll be increasing our client SSD sales all throughout 2015 as well.", "Craig Ellis", "Okay. And then the follow-up is different subject. You noted that the fusion-io integration is essentially complete. The board also authorized very nice $2.5 billion buyback reload. With the announcement on the buyback are you saying that you\u2019re really not focused on M&A and growth through acquisition as we look at 2015 or would that be incorrect conclusion?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "You know, we do not really comment on or speculate on mergers and acquisition. I mean, we are very excited about our position in enterprise SSD solutions space and we of course always keep track of what is going on elsewhere in the industry. We don\u2019t rule out anything. However we don\u2019t speculate on it either.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Craig. Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from CJ Muse with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "CJ Muse", "Great. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, I don\u2019t want to beat a dead horse here, but curious on the client SSD side, was that a function of bit availability, your price or what kind of further clarity can you provide there?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "You know, we are not going to comment on business decisions by our customer given the confidentiality required here. But would again point out that our roadmap of client SSD solutions continues to be very solid, our engagement in client SSD is broadening with our customers very excited about corporate PC platform, as I mentioned earlier.", "And as you know that the attach rate of flash in PC platform is continuing to increase very nicely, particularly in corporate PC platform last year the attach rate of flash to corporate PC was about 40% and this year it suppose to be more than 50% and expected to reach about 80%, 85% by 2018 or so timeframe.", "So it\u2019s a huge opportunity for flash attach rate in corporate PC platforms. We are well positioned with our roadmap and absolutely continuing to drive this opportunity ahead across the broad range of customers.", "CJ Muse", "Helpful. And I guess this is follow-up. In terms of your revenue guide at the high end of the range and I just going back to Doug\u2019s question, can you comment at all on what is imply there in terms of I guess mix as you talked about as well as like-for-like pricing declines and within that construct how you think about supply, demand for NAND for the entire year?", "Judy Bruner", "Yes. As I said before we believe that supply/demand is in a healthy balance for 2015 for the industry in terms of our own mix within that revenue. We expect that our total SSD mix will stay about the same on a year-on-year basis as the client SSD mix comes down, but the enterprise SSD mix goes up. And then we expect that embedded is going to grow and that it will gain in terms of mix relative most likely to retail. Retail in terms of overall market is relatively flattish and so overtime that will tend to come down as a percentage of our revenue.", "CJ Muse", "If I could just ask one quick follow-up, you talked about cost down on the 15% to 25% range, but the implied ASP decline and your revenue guidance is down 28%. So, are we supposed to think that a healthy supply/demand environment has that kind of annual ASP degradation that\u2019s over and above your cost down efforts?", "Judy Bruner", "No. Again as I said earlier I think if you do the math you can come to a pricing environment or decline that is similar in 2015 to 2014. And again there is a lot of mix effects that go into that price. Its not just like-for-like, but our expectation is that the industry will be in a healthy environment and that our gross margins will be increasing across the year.", "CJ Muse", "Thank you.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, CJ. Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Mark Delaney", "Thanks very much for taking the question. I was hoping to follow-up more on Fusion-io you mentioned in the prepared remarks that the integration there was largely complete. Can you talk about how accretive Fusion-io is today and then some of the drivers that you have to improve the accretion for Fusion going forward and when we can expect to see those?", "Judy Bruner", "I would tell you that the Fusion-io acquisition is not accretive yet as we had expected and we continue to expect that it will be accretive in the second half of 2015 which is what we actually said at the time we announce the acquisition.", "Mark Delaney", "Okay. And then, I think also in the prepared remarks you talk about some yield issues in the fourth quarter, have those now been completely resolved?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Yes. Those yield issues have been resolved and our yields on both our 1Y and 1Z technologies, second generation 19-nanometer and 15-nanometer technology they\u2019re all on track, -- my expectation of the business.", "Mark Delaney", "Thank you.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Mark. Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.", "Gabriel Ho", "Hi. This is Gabriel Ho calling in for Ambrish. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to follow-up on the SSD and the embedded margins, because you mentioned that you expect the client SSD to decline while your embedded increase and net-to-net it\u2019s going to be \u2013 gross margin to be similar. And does it imply to my understanding, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, your embedded SSD and your embedded and client SSD margin to be similar at this point or am I missing something?", "Judy Bruner", "Yes. We\u2019ve said in the past that those gross margins are relatively similar and that the gross margins for embedded and client SSD are below our corporate average. The gross margins for enterprise and retail are above our corporate average.", "Gabriel Ho", "So as a follow-up, can you help us understand the dynamics of these SSD pricing, I think looks like the decline \u2013 the price decline accelerating in 2014 and going forward do you think the client SSD to be headwind margins in the longer term?", "Judy Bruner", "Well, we expect client SSD business to grow in the longer term, but we also expect enterprise to grow and in fact we expect enterprise to grow faster than client SSD. So, maybe most to that would be a positive for gross margins.", "Gabriel Ho", "Okay. Thanks.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Gabriel. Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Newman with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Mark Newman", "Hi, thanks for taking my questions. You talked about some yield issues and fab operation issues early on the call. Is there any more guidance you can talk about what exactly happened? And is this is just normal issues or is that shrink from 19 to 15 getting increasingly complex that is making something different. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense if there is something special that happens because you did mention a few times about a supply constraint and I\u2019m trying to understand why specifically that happened?", "And then related to that, if you have supply constraints, can you explain why we\u2019re not seeing stronger ASPs or should we expect that later, because if you would have supply constraint you would assume that you would have more negotiating leverage and that would have upsize on pricing negotiations, and its just a timing thing that we should expect that later or why we\u2019re not seeing the ASP upside from the supply constraint?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Mark regarding the yield question that you asked in terms of the yields, low yields that we experienced during the fourth quarter which as I mentioned earlier are now back on track. There was really nothing that unusual about it, you know such kind of yield excursions from may can occur in the fas in any technology node so nothing out of extraordinary there. We have ofcourse adjusted, point to note though is that then those kind of yield excursions happen in the face of very lean inventories where the business was already running very tight in terms of from supply point of view meeting the customer expectations, then that kind of yield impact has a bigger than that kind of yield loss has a bigger impact on our serviceability to the customers. So that fortunately happened there. I mean the yield also was nothing that unusual, these kind of excursions with advanced technology nodes can occur from time to time. Normally we would have sufficient inventory levels to really be able to correct those and overcome those effects without really passing on any of that issue to the customer side or suffering from any mismatch in terms of demand and supply.", "Regarding your second question, I\u2019m trying to remember what was the second question.", "Judy Bruner", "I\u2019ll take it. You asked about pricing and what if we are in supply constraint, why are we experiencing any price decline? And I guess what I would point out to you is that overall we believe the industry is in good balance and in that good balance environment there is some level of price decline. We need to be competitive in the market place. I would tell you that I believe our absolute prices in almost every area are higher than the competition and because of the value of the products that we are selling and our price decline is modest. We had a 4% sequential price decline in the fourth quarter and that of course includes the impact of fourth quarter retail promotion. And you know you don\u2019t sell and retail especially in the fourth quarter without participating in those promotions even if you are in short supply. And that\u2019s the way the retail market works.", "And so I really believe our pricing position is very good and our price decline is not in any way exaggerated infact our prices, and to really reflect the value of our products.", "Mark Newman", "And then on your buyback sides you\u2019ve got $3 billion now of buybacks. Should we expect, will then in 2015, have you given guidance on how much that would be this year and considering the share price has been weak recently are you going to be opportunistic on potentially front load that?", "Judy Bruner", "As I said in my prepared remarks we expect to spend at least a 100% free cash \u2013 2015 free cash flow on capital return this year of which share repurchase is the biggest piece of that. And so we intend to have a strong share repurchase program and clearly we believe and our board believes in the prospects of the company and so we intend to utilize our plan in an aggressive way relative to our capital return program overtime.", "Mark Newman", "Thank you very much.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Mark. Tanisha, that\u2019s all the time unfortunately we have for the day. But before we end the call, Sanjay would like to make a comment. ", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So I just wanted to say that our Q4 reserves and then near term outlook that we discussed in the call today is really nothing but a temporary setback. In the past SanDisk had setbacks that and SanDisk always emerged even stronger from those setback. I am confident that we shall do the same again this time. SanDisk has a solid strategy, we have excellent capabilities that are only strengthening further and our team is outstanding. And I look forward to a solid progress in our business over the course of the year resulting in substantial momentum in our business in the second half of 2015. And with that let me end by saying thank you and I look forward to speaking with you again soon.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Sanjay. Thank you, Judy. And thank you all for everyone. Thank you for joining us. A webcast replay of today\u2019s call should be available on our IR website shortly.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. Sir, you may begin.", "Robert Blair", "Thank you. As we begin, I want to mention that we will be making forward-looking statements in our comments and in response to your questions, concerning, among other topics, our position and opportunities in the growth of data and the storage ecosystem; the growth areas in storage; our investment focus; our product offerings and our customers\u2019 responses to our product offerings; and demand outlook on our financial performance, including our financial results and expectations for the March quarter.", "These forward-looking statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 4, 2014, and those listed in our registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on November 5, 2014.", "We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events.

After my opening remarks, Olivier Leonetti will provide additional commentary on our December quarter performance and our outlook for the March quarter.", "I am pleased with our financial results in the December quarter. We achieved strong revenue, gross margin and earnings performance. We also generated significant cash flow from operations in the quarter excluding the impact of the Seagate arbitration award. The diversified nature of our business together with ongoing secular growth in data and crisp execution by our HGST and WD subsidiaries continue to enable us to consistently deliver strong financial performance. Market dynamics in the December quarter were in line with our expectations. In our business we saw particular strength and demand for capacity enterprise and video surveillance hard drives and for enterprise SSDs. As anticipated there was a seasonal demand uptick for branded products. ", "We expect ongoing hyper-scale cloud deployments coupled with our expanding product portfolio and customer engagement model to continue fuelling our growth and capacity enterprise for the foreseeable future. Terabyte growth in this category is expected to remain strong. Our flash platform solution business which includes our expanding portfolio of enterprise class SSDs maintained its growth trajectory in the quarter delivering revenue of $187 million. The demand outlook for the March quarter reflects a normal seasonal decline with moderation in client, branded products and performance enterprise with stable demand and capacity enterprise. We believe overall supply and demand and associated inventory levels remain balanced. I continue to be encouraged by the ongoing stabilization of the PC market where demand has been in line with our expectations. Furthermore, I am encouraged by the market\u2019s response to our strategic growth initiative, which legally position the company to thrive in the evolving data storage ecosystem. We've strengthened our value proposition by enhancing our technical expertise, expanding our product portfolio and investing in our go-to-market capabilities. We will continue to prudently evaluate investment opportunities to advance these initiatives.", "We gained traction in key markets during the December quarter, a broad line-up of high-capacity hard drives, including those based on our proprietary HelioSeal platform continued to be embraced by both traditional enterprise and hyper scale data center customers. We continue to invest in high-growth vertical market applications. Specifically, we've seen strong customer acceptance of our WD Purple hard drives in the security surveillance market. We launched the 6-terabyte model in the December quarter that has been well received by customers. We expect strong ongoing growth in this space given the rapid adoption of digital video cameras and security surveillance systems worldwide. There continues to be strong growth momentum and branded with our portfolio of My Cloud solutions addressing both the consumer and prosumer markets.", "The My Cloud software and apps had now been downloaded by more than 4 million users worldwide. We are engaged with customers and partners on our recently announced Active Archive Platform. Proof-of-concept systems are up and running and initial customer feedback has been positive. This new category of storage solution will feature high-density peta-scale capacities in a single rack and deliver entirely new levels of storage efficiency and value. ", "And as a reminder we expect revenue growth from our Flash Platforms business to outpace that of the industry. Before turning it over to Olivier, I would like to thank and recognize our employees worldwide for helping to deliver a strong second quarter. Our consistent financial performance is a testament to the strength of our team, a well diversified business, leading products and customer centric engagement model. Olivier?", "Olivier Leonetti", "Thank you Steve. Expected seasonal demand and consistent execution help us exceed financial expectations in the December quarter. Industry shipments were in line with the TAM implied in our guidance provided in October.", "In our business, we saw continued strength in capacity enterprise, the anticipated seasonal increase in branded products as well as continued steady demand in performance enterprise. Aggregated channel inventories of Western Digital products remain within our four to six week range.", "Our revenue for the December quarter was $3.9 billion. This included $187 million in revenue related to our Flash Platforms Solutions Group. We shipped a total of 61 million hard drive at an average selling price of $60. The quarter-over-quarter increase in our [LSP] [ph] was driven by strength in capacity enterprise, surveillance along with the seasonal improvement in client and branded products. ", "Our gross margin was 29.1%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 30.5% which is better than our implied guidance due to business mix. This excludes $55 million of amortization of intangibles and other non-recurring charges.", "Operating expenses totalled $644 million. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $620 million, excluding amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges, and the flood insurance recovery. Expenses were higher than our implied guidance due to incentive compensation and stock appreciation rights. Tax expense for the December quarter was $20 million or 4% of pre-tax income. The tax rate reflects the retroactive extension of the US federal R&D tax credit that was signed into law during the December quarter. Our net income totalled $460 million or $1.93 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $539 million or $2.26 per share. This includes the $0.07 per share tax benefit from the R&D tax benefit. ", "Turning to the balance sheet, in the December quarter we generated $243 million in cash from operations and our free cash flow totalled $97 million. As a reminder we paid a total of $773 million related to an arbitration award in the December quarter. Our CapEx totalled $146 million or 4% of revenue. We repurchased 3.2 million shares for $309 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.40 per share.", "We closed Q2 with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.9 billion of which approximately $1.4 billion was held in the U.S.", "I\u2019ll now provide guidance for the March quarter. We expect revenue to be in a range of $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion. Gross margin percentage roughly flat with our Q2 performance excluding the amortization of intangibles.", "R&D and SG&A spending of approximately $610 million, excluding the amortization of intangibles. The tax rate of approximately 7.5% and a share count of approximately $237 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.90 and $2 for the March quarter.", "Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have just two questions and a follow-up. First of all, can you talk on the pricing dynamic that you are seeing this quarter and potentially in the March quarter? One of your peers reported a couple of days ago they talked extensively about pricing concerns starting to creep up, so I'm curious what you are seeing and what you expect as it goes forward?", "Steve Milligan", "This is Steve. If you look at our fiscal Q2, so the quarter we just finished, and it is consistent with my commentary, we saw nothing unusual from a pricing perspective, versus our expectations. And we see nothing unusual this quarter from a pricing perspective. So, what I would say is that pricing behavior and price levels are just simply consistent with our expectations.", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Got it, and if I could just follow up MOFCOM, you issued a press release in December talking about the letter you guys received and the rectification you're doing. Is there any update on that as you go forward? Is there a time lime that we start to think about given the fact that you had the update in December?", "Steve Milligan", "Yes. So let me review where we are at. We did announce recently that there were a couple of compliance issues that we had, that were resolved with MOFCOM. We were pleased to get those issues behind us. We have also indicated that given the resolution of those issues MOFCOM is now fully focused on reviewing our applications. Those issues needed to get resolved before MOFCOM began the formal evaluation of our application to have both separate listed. That is in process, and ongoing, and as I have indicated before, our relationship and dialogue with MOFCOM is consistent and constructive but at this point I can\u2019t provide any update as to timing, as to when MOFCOM will provide any sort of ruling. But we are working with them in a constructive fashion and we will continue to do so.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you, and congratulations on a nice quarter.", "Steve Milligan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company, your line is open.", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Thank you, good afternoon gentlemen. A couple of questions; first, can you just talk about the capacity enterprise segment and your ability to ship officially given some of the data center build-out plans as calendar 2015 unfolds? ", "Steve Milligan", "Sure. Yes, so we in the past quarter saw a good demand for our products, for capacity enterprise products, particularly from hyperscale customers. We expect that to continue. The last call I talked about having good visibility to the middle part of calendar 2015. That statement remains valid. Really what we are seeing is, we are seeing meaningful growth in terms of Petabyte deployments on behalf of our customers. We expect that to continue on through the balance of calendar 2015, how that translates to a unit of performance perspective is a little bit unknown at this point. It will vary depending upon the capacity point that has shipped as the industry transitions initially from a 4-terabyte drive to a 6-terabyte drive and then eventually at least for us to an 8-terabyte deployment. But, we are confident that we are going to continue to see strong terabyte growth for our business and for the industry and the capacity enterprise space.", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "And you are comfortable with your component supply and ability to go and hit those demands?", "Steve Milligan", "Well, I mean there is a little bit of a qualification as kind of yes and no answer, Rich. Supply is tight. We are comfortable with where we\u2019re at, but it\u2019s tight. And so, we\u2019re watching that closely. And so these things, they use a lot of heads and disks, a lot of test time, and so we got to be watching that closely. But, right now, relative to our expectations, we\u2019re comfortable with where we\u2019re at. But, if we see more variability from an upside perspective, which is obviously possible we could run in the supply challenges.", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay, and then I will ask you obligatory TAM questions. In the December quarter, you obviously, 141, larger than what your competitor was talking about, but not too surprising. When you look at normal seasonality, how would you look at the March quarter? What should we be expecting?", "Steve Milligan", "Yes. So, to reiterate what I talked about in terms of my [indiscernible] and I know that there were some analysts had different numbers out there, but the TAM for the December quarter pretty much turned out the way that we expected.", "So the TAM, and again we will see what numbers Toshiba publishes, but a TAM in the 141 million unit range was very consistent with the expectations that we had going into the quarter. I would say that if you want to call it a surprise, the mix might have been a little bit better than what we saw and therefore you see a bit higher revenue for us and the resulting merging benefit associated with the. If we looked at where we think the TAM will shake out in March, I think something in that mid-130 range is kind of a reasonable assumption.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel, your line is open.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks for taking the question. I do have a follow up as well. Going back on the enterprise business, can you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape? When we look at the numbers and look at what some of your component suppliers have reported, it would appear that Toshiba saw a pretty healthy quarter in enterprise shipments. So can you talk about seeing Toshiba being at all a disruptor, and going after some of those high-capacity deals? And if not, whether you think that changes on a going forward basis? ", "Steve Milligan", "We didn't see anything unusual in that regard. If we look at what happened in terms of higher enterprise shipments, and I am sort of using rough numbers here, I think our units increased on a quarter-on-quarter basis about 300,000 units; and a bit of that was capacity enterprise, a bit of that was performance enterprise. If you recall one of the things that we were focused on from a performance enterprise perspective was to continue to broaden our product portfolio so that we had full coverage from a market perspective.", "We began shipping our 15K small form factor drive, which allowed us to pick up some incremental business in the performance enterprise space. And with our strong portfolio and position in the capacity enterprise business, we were able to increase our business a bit there. We believe, although we will have to see how the final numbers shake out, that we maybe gain a little bit of share in that space. And so we are obviously pleased with that. From a customer, call it, satisfaction perspective, but we did not see anything from a competitive dynamic perspective in that space, that was unusual or shall we say alarming from our perspective.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And as a follow-up, maybe a higher level question, but when you think about your capital structure and kind of the return of cash going forward, your closest competitor raised a very impressive 20-year note in this latest quarter. How are you thinking about your return of capital and cash, and in particular how you think about the dividend trajectory on a going-forward basis, obviously in the context of the US held cash?", "Olivier Leonetti", "So, let me take this question. So, we are always evaluating the way we deploy our capital and we believe that the current allocation is probably be a good balance between short-term management and prudent long-term investment in the business. And at this stage we have no particular plan to change the current capital allocation, but again are under evaluation all the time. To answer to your question, specifically about US cash, and how that is a constraint. We have a fair amount of liquidity in the US through our cash balances, $1.4 billion at this stage, but also debt capacity which is quite high as well, our leverage ratio is in the range of 4.7, as you know. So we can sustain our current allocation for at least four years or more.", "Steve Milligan", "So one thing just to add to that is that -- the key thing is that we\u2019re focused on longer term value creation and making sure that we have a capital structure that enables us to do that. And obviously the dynamics that influence that, our needs for cash, uses of cash, all of that, but it\u2019s centred fundamentally on what do we need to do as a business to make sure that we are creating a long-term value for ourselves and our shareholders going forward.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal, your line is open.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "Thank you. I had two as well. Steve, I want to start with you. You indicated that pricing was consistent with your view. I wonder if you could flush that out a little more. What were like-for-like pricing either in December quarter, and/or what are you expecting in the March quarter? And against that trajectory, are the newer liner enterprise performance drives deviating from the overall pattern associated with the rest of your product portfolio?", "Steve Milligan", "As an overall segment we had been saying, I recall that, low single-digit price decline, like-for-like. And really that\u2019s still holding more or less a quite confident or consistent on a relative basis over the last few quarters. And so frankly we just did not see anything -- let me qualify. There is always pockets -- this is a competitive business. There is always pockets of where pricing in this segment might be doing something a little bit unusual here and there. But, we did not see anything unusual from a pricing perspective, either quarter, or we are seeing anything unusual in terms of the March quarter.", "Keith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, but within that, just if you could [flash out] [ph], is near line \u2013 does that also embrace the near line product portfolio, that you're not seeing anything outside of that kind of low single-digit sequential difference?", "Olivier Leonetti", "Well, near line is a little bit different in the sense that...but this again is not a change. I mean the first thing is, is that there is a fair amount of margin on those products...", "Keith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Right.", "Olivier Leonetti", "We're also introducing higher capacity points in those products preceded by a 4-terabyte, you're going to see the clients for those capacity [points] [ph] that exceed the overall average, but that\u2019s not anything unusual. When it gets introduced, it may be in limited supply as the supply begins to increase and you see greater customer acceptance of that. And as we come down the cost curve, the price declines and tend to be steeper. But that is nothing at all unusual.", "Keith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. And then Steve, this is my follow-up question, if you wanted to provide your views, if the TAM comes out to a mid-130s, as you said, for the March quarter, how are you thinking about the TAM as you look out, particularly with related to PC clients? I'm sure you're aware of a lot of consternation, especially what the PC market can deliver this year. I wanted to see if you could just provide some high-level views as you look out over the next couple quarters on the VHED TAM and/or that PC client TAM? And that's it for me, thanks.", "Steve Milligan", "Sure. We would expect at present and of course our expectations can change that the March quarter will be the [low points] [ph] for the year. So at this point for the June quarter, we think that we could see either a flat or maybe slightly up TAM in the June quarter; more obviously update our expectations for that as we move through the quarter. And then obviously as we move through the back half of the calendar year where we get help from the seasonality perspective, we would expect to see the TAM increase from there.", "Operator", "The next question comes from James Kisner of Jefferies LLC, your line is open.", "James Kisner - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you. I'm guess this is going to press more on the PC market, or the client market. Your competitor ventured a guess, but the overall growth rate might be for the year for client units, I think they said low single digits. Would you agree with that? Do you have any view? ", "Steve Milligan", "We have consistently indicated that we expect that PC sales will -- well let me backup, what\u2019s still happening is that we have been saying low single digit decline on a year-on-year basis in the PC space. That went consistent with our expectation and we would expect that going forward that we will continue to see that. As that relates to hard drive shipments into the PC segment we also have to contemplate the fact that more and more client units are using solid state devices versus rotating magnetic storage and so we will see more of a drag than that low single digit in terms of hard drive shift into the PC market. And so that\u2019s very consistent with what we\u2019ve been saying for the last several quarters and very consistent with our expectations.", "James Kisner - Jefferies LLC", "And a quick follow up, could you update us on the uptake of the Helium? Did it contribute at all to ASPs, or is it not material factor there? Thank you.", "Steve Milligan", "Yeah. Relative to the helium, let me broaden that a little bit, clearly part of the reason that we saw an uptick in terms of our ASPs and also our margins were due to the strength in our capacity enterprise business of which helium is a part of that. Helium as an individual category, particularly as it relates to 6-terabyte drive probably did not have a material impact. We believe that as we transition to the 8- terabyte platform with the helium product, we will begin to see a bit of a larger impact.", "James Kisner - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank North America", "Hi, thank you, I was hoping to get a little more detail on your surveillance market. You called it out as being strong this quarter. Can you give us a little more detail on the magnitude of that market and where it is represented in your unit numbers?", "Steve Milligan", "Yes. Well is it in the consumer electronics number? So, our CE line on our data sheet is where the surveillance drives are contained, Sherri and it\u2019s a market that we expect will grow in low single-digit growth rate and so some expanding area on an obviously now you are seeing in some of the news, and the impact of that. And so it\u2019s a good market for us and it also carried a gross margin profile that is above the overall corporate average.", "Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank North America", "Okay great. And then, just thinking about the enterprise SSD market, that business looks like it was up 20% for you year-over-year. What types of growth expectations do you have for that segment going forward? Thanks.", "Steve Milligan", "Yes. We had a very large order at Q2 last year. If you look at the sequential, it is pretty strong and we have indicated that would expect to grow faster than the market and the market is expected to grow at about 40% and we\u2019re staying behind that trajectory. ", "Operator", "The next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley, your line is open.", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "How are you thinking about any risk of cloud vendors either catching up with demand or getting through their investment cycle, and some more lumpiness as we go into the back half? Is there any visibility or high-level thoughts on whether we could see lumpiness further out in that market? And then I have a follow up. ", "Steve Milligan", "Yes, Katy, that's something that we keep a close eye on the -- we are seeing, as I indicated strong growth from a Petabyte prespective, when we talk to our customer, and they talk about what\u2019s happening from what they are seeing they expect the Petabyte growth to continue. But at times they can be a little bit unpredictable in terms of the order flow and we saw that last year. So we felt pretty comfortable with where we are at right now, but it is something that we monitor pretty closely. But we are confident that overall data growth will continue to be very strong. It\u2019s just a matter of how the storage get deployed against that where sometimes the lumpiness can potentially come in.", "Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, and then Seagate is talking about turning over their entire product portfolio this calendar year. Is that something that impacts your OpEx, and if not, do you view yourself at any advantage or disadvantages as they go through that cycle? ", "Steve Milligan", "We are not expecting there to be any abnormal increase, I guess I would say, in terms of our operating expense as it relates to product deployments. And we are continuing to invest in some of these new growth initiatives, but that's different and refreshing our base hard drive products. So, we would not expect that we would see, call it a surge in our operating expenses as it relates to that and we continue to expect that we are going to have a competitive product line-up to matchup against our competitors.", "Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Joe Yoo at Citi Research. Your line is open.", "Joe Yoo - Citigroup", "Thank you, Steve and I apologize that I'm asking another pricing question, but I was wondering if you had any thoughts on the weakness of the Yen and its potential impact to hard drive pricing? And did it have any impact to your pricing strategy, or do you think that maybe it affected Toshiba's behavior?", "Steve Milligan", "That would be speculative. I don\u2019t know. And so if the question that ultimately would need to be directed to Toshiba to get a more specific question, I would reiterate really one thing and that relative to what we saw from the competitive dynamic perspective. We didn't really see anything that was particularly out of the ordinary. The other thing I would add, which is just kind of anecdotal comment. I was at Hitachi as a CEO there and Yen movement did not impact at all. anything that we did. But, I don't know how it impacts Toshiba. ", "Joe Yoo \u2013 Citigroup", "Great, thank you. And my follow-up is on the flash platform solution, can you provide some tangible factors that give you the confidence that you can grow above the market?", "Steve Milligan", "Well, let me take the most tangible factor as we have been growing faster than the market. So I think that history is probably the thing that gives the most tangible proof of that. The other thing is that we have a product roadmap that we\u2019re focused on, that has been discussed and shared with our customers. We are sampling some new products with our customers. We\u2019re getting positive feedback and so as we go through the development process and when we go through prequalification process with our customers, our confidence in our ability to grow faster than the market just continues to be solid.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital, your line is open.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital, LLC", "Congratulations on a solid quarter. Two if I could. Steve, I would love to get your view on the need for the industry margin structure to continue to rise, as we talked about the cloud demand and hyperscale picks up and the negative supply environment there begins to tighten up, through the impact that can have on your ability to ship the overall TAM? I would love to get your thoughts there, and then I have a follow-up as well, thanks.", "Steve Milligan", "Let me take that question in a different direction, rather than me speculating on where the industry margins go. Let me talk about the things that are impacting our business. What\u2019s fundamentally happening from our standpoint is the secular forces, if you want to refer to it that way are basically -- what\u2019s increasing is those elements of our business, they carry higher margins. So we have a tailwind, in effect, that is pushing us to higher-margin opportunities. Also, the things that we\u2019re investing in the strategic growth initiatives, generally speaking carry higher margins. Right now, 58% of our business is \u201cnon-PC\u201d. And we know and we said this in the past that the PC market is more price sensitive and there is less ability to differentiate and accordingly those products carry lower margin profiles. But, as our revenue increases in the non-PC segment generally carrying higher margins, we have a bias over time for gross margins increasing as opposed to decreasing over time. That being said, we continue to have a stated gross margin range of 27 and 32. But, as these things continue to evolve, we\u2019ll look at whether or not we need to re-evaluate on that gross margin range.", "Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Capital, LLC", "Got it, that is really helpful. I appreciate it. And just as my follow up quickly, do you believe that the TAM has a chance to grow in 2015 over 2014?", "Steve Milligan", "We believe that we\u2019ll see low single-digit growth from an overall TAM perspective.", "Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Capital, LLC", "Got it, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open.", "Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research", "Thanks, good afternoon. Steve, just going back over the pricing one more time. I understand what you are talking about, just typical pricing patterns, especially as you go up to a higher capacity. It seems like your competitor is saying that the typical pricing should not apply, because of the rising complexities and the tighter components, and just the overall cost of capacity. Can you just react to that statement as to whether there is the potential for the industry to change in terms of how it looks at pricing as you go from 4 to 6 to 8 terabyte products?", "Steve Milligan", "Well it is kind of difficult for me to comment on that specifically. I mean the bottom-line to it is that I am going to repeat two things and that pricing was consistent with our expectation and at the end of the day and order for us to be able to do what we need to do, we have to have pricing that is competitive with the industry. Whatever that means in terms of you know what price declines, whatever it means but at the end of the day we did not see anything particularly unusual and remember that margins in that business carry higher margins. So I mean we are comfortable in general with where we are position in that regard.", "Steven Fox - Cross Research", "Fair enough, it was worth a shot. And then just as a quick follow up, your average capacity was up 24% year-over-year. Obviously some of that, or a lot of that was driven by the enterprise capacity drivers. But can you sort of dissect that a little bit further and talk about how average capacity looks year over year in some of the other products. Thanks.", "Olivier Leonetti", "I mean we could obviously as Steve indicated we saw big increase year-over-year and exhibiting the capacity enterprise. If I look at the rest of the business, performance enterprise going low single digits and the rest of much pretty much stable year on year.", "Steve Milligan", "So I was kind of trying back to the point that was I making earlier as more and more of our business is deployed against non-PC applications, generally speaking those were higher mixed products where they would be branders, whether it would be surveillance, it would on the enterprise space and so as on mix transitions from an overall business prospective we are going to get a nice bump in terms of the average capacity point shift.", "Steven Fox - Cross Research", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "The next questions from Joe Wittine of Longbow Research. Your line is open.", "Joe Wittine - Longbow Research", "Hi, thanks. Steve, you acknowledge hard drives will lose share within the PC category, and we are going to see that accelerate exiting the year. So, I am kind of assuming your expectations of low single digit decline for PCs, is the current trajectory in your client units which is down 7% or 8% on a year-over-year basis, is that a good guesstimate or barometer going forward of what the trajectory will be? Thanks.", "Steve Milligan", "We anticipate again we will see what Toshiba publishes that we lost a little bit of share in the Notebook space and that was primarily because which of what kind have happened over the last couple of quarters, some of that may have a little bit to do with gaming, and then also that is where margins tend to be lower and so that may be some of the area where we just chose to not participate in some of the business.", "So I would say that decline is steeper that what the industry is seeing.", "Joe Wittine - Longbow Research", "Helpful, thanks.", "Operator", "The last question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird. Your line is open.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc", "Great, thanks for taking me in. Steve, a question on the archive market. You have launched product that seems to be built specifically for that opportunity. Could you talk a little bit about traction there, and what the potential is longer-term?", "Steve Milligan", "As I indicated in my remarks, we have got some, I hate to call sample units but we have got some customer applications running and test unit and that kind of thing and response so far. Our customers are very pleased that we actually now have to construct a subsystem for them, given that we have been a component supplier for so long and so we are encouraged and I think it\u2019s fair to say that our customers are encouraged as well. It is some of the progress that we are making in that area.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc", "When you say you will be moving up the enterprise stack, is this an example of that and will some of that be more obvious down the road, or is it mostly going to be things that happen behind the scenes?", "Steve Milligan", "Yes, this is an example of that. We are going to have to see all of that evolves. We will look at opportunity to intelligently move up the enterprise stack and will do our best to do that which we have done so far in a collaborative fashion with our customers. Our goal is not to compete with our customers but they figure out of that way of enabling them, so that they can extent their value proposition to their customers whether that be through other software services, other kind of offerings. So that is our base strategy is.", "Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc.", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Steve Milligan", "Any more questions?", "Operator", "That was our last question.", "Steve Milligan", "So thank you again for joining us today and closing I want to thank all of our employees and suppliers for their commitment and outstanding execution and our customers for their continued business.", "Operator", "That conclude today conference.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jay Iyer, please go ahead sir.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Shaneal and good afternoon everyone. With me on the call today are Sanjay Mehrotra, President and CEO and Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President of Administration and CFO. In a moment, we will hear remarks from both of them followed by Q&A.", "Before we begin, please note that any non-GAAP financial measures discussed during this call, as defined by the SEC in Regulation G, will be reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The reconciliation of our financial results is available in the press release issued this afternoon. A presentation containing supplemental information and non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation tables, including for all applicable guidance, will be posted on our investor relations website at www.sandisk.com/IR after the prepared remarks. This guidance is exclusive of any one-time transactions and does not reflect the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures or similar transactions that may be completed after July 22, 2015.", "During our call today, we will make forward-looking statements that refer to expectations, projections, beliefs and other future events.

SanDisk assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, which speak as of today.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Sanjay.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Thank you Jay and good afternoon everyone. Our second quarter results benefited from more favorable performance than expected in enterprise and retail. We are also making good progress in strengthening our product roadmap and customer engagements. For the second half of 2015, we expect the industry environment to remain stable and look forward to delivering sequential revenue and profit growth as we continue to make progress in enhancing our execution.", "In our April conference call, we discussed the pending re-qualification of a new embedded component for a customer\u2019s use in their client SSD application. We have completed the SanDisk internal validation of this new product and the qualification work on the customer side is progressing well. We expect to complete the full customer re-qualification process in the third quarter and begin revenue shipments soon thereafter.", "In enterprise SSDs, our Fusion-io revenue grew sequentially in Q2. We also announced our next generation Fusion ioMemory PCIe application accelerators based on our 1Y NAND technology, enabling a significantly lower price point for our customers. We believe that the more competitive pricing enabled by our captive memory-based PCIe products will open up new workloads for this product category. We are currently shipping these captive NAND based PCIe solutions through distribution channels and customer qualifications at several OEMs are expected to be completed in the second half of this year.", "Another factor that we believe will stimulate the future expansion of the enterprise PCIe market is the expected broadening deployment of NVMe infrastructure and availability of NVMe PCIe solutions in 2016 and 2017. In addition, PCIe flash solutions offer higher performance than SATA SSDs, due to the lower latency and higher bandwidth of PCIe. We plan to begin addressing the NVMe PCIe market opportunity with a new offering available for qualification in mid-2016. To increase SanDisk\u2019s penetration in the enterprise SATA market, I am pleased to report that we introduced the CloudSpeed Eco Gen. II, a highly competitive 15 nanometer based 2 terabyte SATA SSD in the second quarter. The solution is now in qualification at multiple hyperscale customers with revenue contribution expected to begin later this year.", "Our enterprise SAS SSDs sales performed well during the quarter driven by better than expected demand for several of our products. Our 4 terabyte Optimus Max SAS SSD was the first of its kind in the market and is making a compelling case for the replacement of 15K and 10K RPM enterprise HDDs. The Optimus Max SSD has become an important high capacity solution for one of our OEM customer\u2019s All Flash Array offerings. Several other OEM and hyperscale customers are now qualifying our 4 TB enterprise SAS SSD because they see the value of reducing their total cost of acquisition and ownership by utilizing this highest capacity solution. We are developing our next generation 15 nanometer-based 12 Gb/s SAS SSD with higher capacity and performance, and expect to introduce that solution to market in 2016 with revenue contribution starting in late 2016.", "We are excited about the progress we are making with our next generation converged platform for enterprise products, which brings the best technologies and IP together from our various acquisitions. This converged platform will be heavily leveraged across multiple product families in the enterprise segment, and allow us to offer market-leading products integrated with our next generation 3D NAND memories. Given the long engineering development cycle typically associated with such major programs, we expect to start sampling products based on this new architecture in 2017. While we expect to continue to grow our enterprise revenue over the next couple of years, we aim to rapidly increase our market momentum once this converged architecture is introduced into volume production.", "Turning to our enterprise system and software solution offerings, since our announcement of our breakthrough InfiniFlash platform in March this year, we have been building up a strong pipeline of potential customers, many of whom have started proof-of-concept engagements with us. Customers are excited to see the potential of this InfiniFlash platform, as it enables them to rethink how flash can structurally improve their data center capabilities when deployed at petabyte scale. Our InfiniFlash platform allows customers to replace hard-disk drive-based solutions with our all-flash solution. InfiniFlash features excellent performance and the industry\u2019s highest density of flash at a breakthrough price point, where it competes with HDD-based solutions in both total cost of ownership as well as upfront acquisition cost, while solving a lot of challenges customers are facing today with scale-out deployments. As the mega-trends towards cloud computing, open source software and data analytics gather momentum, InfiniFlash is the solution at the intersection of these important trends, and we are excited about its potential to accelerate flash adoption in data centers over the next several years.", "Switching to client SSDs, traction for our solutions increased with PC OEMs and in the channel. We announced and started shipping our 15 nanometer X2 client SSDs to the channel and began qualification of these drives with our OEM customers to whom we expect to begin revenue shipments in the second half of 2015. From a market perspective, although the overall PC environment is weak, we believe OEM customers are rapidly increasing their use of SSDs due to the many benefits we have outlined in the past. For example, in the corporate market served by OEMs, CIOs have embraced the benefits of SSDs, resulting in an SSD attach rate to corporate notebooks that is expected to approach 40% by the end of 2015. Decline in unit prices of 128 gigabyte and 256 gigabyte SSDs continues to reduce the gap when compared to HDD unit prices, with the 128 gigabyte drive approaching cost parity with low-capacity HDDs.", "This inflection point is expected to further cause the consumer notebook segment, which today has a low SSD attach rate of less than 15%, to accelerate adoption of SSDs. We are well positioned to benefit from this trend with our new product offerings such as the SanDisk Z400S based on 15 nanometer X2 technology and our 1Y X3 based SSDs, which offer a compelling value proposition for PC OEMs. We are excited to address this growth opportunity ahead of us, as we expect SSDs will rapidly replace HDDs in laptops and desktops.", "Moving on to our mobile embedded product portfolio, we completed the qualification and began shipments of our 15 nanometer X3 customized solution as planned. We have also been working on another new custom embedded 15 nanometer X3 solution that is in the late stages of customer qualification, and expect to be shipping this new product in significant volume in the third quarter. Within the iNAND product family, we are expanding the adoption of our solutions. Our 1Y X3 based iNAND products, which are designed to meet the requirements of high performance mobile platforms with our innovative Smart SLC technology, are expected to ship to multiple mobile OEMs in the third quarter. Additionally, just last week at Mobile World Congress in Shanghai, we introduced an iNAND product built on 15 nanometer X3 that increases embedded capacity to 128 gigabytes, providing greater performance and cost benefits to mobile OEMs. We expect to qualify and ship these iNAND products to key mobile customers in the second half of 2015.", "We are also gaining traction in newer flash markets, including connected home, automotive storage, industrial and the Internet of Things. In connected home, cable operators are beginning to use our flash storage solutions in set top boxes to improve delivery of high-demand content across their networks. Automakers continue to add computational power to their cars as a means of providing infotainment differentiation and advanced driver assistance capabilities. ", "As the automotive industry marches towards a future that will include autonomous driving, storage requirements will grow immensely and we expect to be a leading provider of innovative solutions to this industry. The IoT market is still in its early stages of development; however, we are excited to have been selected by some leading solution suppliers for inclusion in their IoT reference designs, which we believe will lead to expanding opportunities for flash. In retail, we have made progress recovering from our temporary share loss experienced in Q414 and Q115, which was due to the supply constraints we discussed in earlier calls. Overall, retail had a good second quarter, driven by demand for imaging cards and SSDs.", "In June, we introduced a new SanDisk product category with the SanDisk Extreme 900 and SanDisk Extreme 500 external SSDs at 1.92 terabytes and 480 gigabytes of capacities respectively. With no moving parts and significantly faster speeds than portable HDDs, these rugged external SSDs are the perfect solution for photographers and videographers on the go.", "To summarize my comments on products, we have made considerable progress towards addressing our roadmap. Many of our new products are now at various stages of qualification, and we expect our portfolio to continue to strengthen in 2015 and throughout 2016 as well. From a fab manufacturing perspective, our 15 nanometer technology continued ramping through the quarter with bit output exceeding 1Y volume for Q2. The mix of X3 remained at more than 50% of total bits sold.", "We also completed the planned 5% wafer capacity expansion for 2015 during the second quarter, and we believe the inventory challenges we discussed on the last two calls are now behind us. ", "In 3D NAND, we have begun our equipment purchases to support the commencement of pilot production of our 48-layer architecture in the second half of 2015. We are on track to begin using the pilot line output for product samples in 2015, and we continue to expect 3D NAND product sales to begin in 2016. The 48-layer technology provides an excellent combination of increased density, higher performance and lower power compared to 2D NAND.", "We plan to implement our 3D NAND first in high-capacity removable products, then client SSDs and embedded solutions, followed by enterprise SSD solutions, which have longer design and qualification periods. From a supply bit growth rate standpoint, for 2015, we expect the industry\u2019s year-over-year supply bit growth to be somewhat above our previous estimate of approximately 40%, and we expect our captive bit growth to be in-line with the industry. For 2016, our latest estimate is that both the industry and SanDisk supply bit growth rates will be lower than in 2015.", "Some of you may be wondering about the Toshiba announcements from yesterday. While there is some change to the management structure of Toshiba\u2019s semiconductor business, we continue to believe that this will not impact the strategy, investments and execution of the joint venture and that NAND remains a high priority for Toshiba.", "To conclude, we are making progress in strengthening our product portfolio and improving our execution, and we are driving vigorously to regain our overall business momentum. We look forward to delivering improved results in the second half of 2015.", "I will now turn the call to Judy for the financial discussion.", "Judy Bruner", "Thank you, Sanjay. Before I begin, I would like to add to Sanjay's comments on Toshiba and mention that while we are still evaluating the findings of the investigation, we do not expect Toshiba's announcement yesterday to have any impact to our financial results. I will now review our Q2 results and then discuss our outlook, which remains within the range of expectations we outlined in April.", "Our second quarter revenue of $1.24 billion was down 7% sequentially and down 24% year-over-year. Our client SSD revenue declined as expected due to the end of life during Q1 of a program with a major customer, while our client SSD revenue with other OEM customers increased nicely from Q1 to Q2. Our enterprise revenue also declined sequentially, for the reasons we discussed on our April call.", "Embedded revenue was down sequentially in Q2 due to the seasonality of certain embedded products, while our removable revenue increased sequentially driven by seasonality and share gains. By channel, our retail revenue increased 4% sequentially and represented 39% of our Q2 revenue mix, while commercial revenue declined 13% sequentially and represented 61% of our revenue mix.", "Our gigabytes sold were down sequentially by 1% and down year-over-year by 6%, with the year-over-year decline driven largely by rebuilding of our inventory levels combined with the loss of the client SSD program at a major customer as we have previously discussed. The decline in our blended ASP per gigabyte was more modest than in Q1, with a sequential decline of 6% and a year-over-year decline of 21%.", "Our all-in cost per gigabyte declined 4% sequentially and declined 10% year-over-year. Sequentially, the key drivers of cost reduction were a weaker yen, a higher mix of 15 nanometer memory and lower inventory-related charges, with these factors partially offset by a higher mix of non-captive memory. On a year-over-year basis, cost reduction benefited from technology transition, a higher mix of X3, non-memory cost reductions and a weaker yen, with these benefits partially offset by higher inventory reserves, Malaysia factory startup costs and a higher mix of non-captive memory.", "Our non-GAAP gross margin of 42% was better than we had forecasted due primarily to product mix, with a stronger mix of retail and enterprise products and a lower mix of embedded MCP products. The yen to dollar exchange rate in our captive memory cost of sales was 117, and non-captive memory was used in 6% of our sales, compared to 2% in Q1 and 1% in Q2 of last year.", "Our Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses of $327 million were sequentially lower by $48 million, with the reduction stemming from lower charges for restructuring and other, a reduction-in-force, which was largely completed in the second quarter, and some engineering project expenses which shifted from the second quarter to the second half. Our Q2 non-GAAP operating margin, inclusive of the restructuring and other charges, was 15%, consistent with the Q1 non-GAAP operating margin.", "In Q2, our non-GAAP other income of $10 million included $7 million of one-time gains related to foreign exchange and venture investments. Our Q2 non-GAAP tax rate remained at 32%, while our Q2 GAAP tax rate was 11% due to a discrete benefit from a tax audit settlement. The reduction in our non-GAAP diluted share count was driven by a full quarter weighting of our Q1 share repurchases, a partial weighting of the 3.7 million shares repurchased in Q2, and elimination of dilution from the 2017 warrants related to our convertible debt, as the warrants were not in-the-money for Q2.", "Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Our share of flash venture fab investments during Q2 was $233 million, and non-fab capital investments were $96 million. For these total gross capital investments of $329 million, we utilized cash of $80 million, with the difference funded by new joint venture equipment leases of $97 million and joint venture working capital. Our off-balance sheet joint venture equipment lease guarantees stood at $636 million at the end of Q2.", "Our inventory increased sequentially by $68 million, and on a petabyte basis, the inventory reflects approximately 12 weeks of forward supply. We expect to continue holding inventory at approximately this level of weeks in order to provide adequate supply for our diverse products and customers. For Q2, cash flow from operations was $29 million, compared to $309 million in Q1 and $241 million in Q2 of 2014.", "The primary drivers of the sequential decline in cash flow from operations were the seasonality of our accounts receivable, which is typically a source of cash in Q1 and a use of cash in Q2, coupled with the planned increase in our inventory levels. On a year-over-year basis, the decline in cash flow from operations was driven primarily by the decline in net income and the growth in inventory.", "Free cash flow for Q2 was a negative $52 million, and we spent $250 million on share repurchases and $63 million on the quarterly dividend. Our cash ended the quarter at $4.0 billion on a gross basis and $1.5 billion, net of debt. We expect our cash flow from operations to be at a significantly stronger run rate in the second half compared to Q2, and we currently plan to continue share repurchases in the second half of 2015.", "Now I\u2019ll turn to our outlook. Our current estimate for 2015 revenue remains within the range of $5.4 to $5.7 billion that we provided in April. We expect the majority of our sequential second half revenue growth to come from mobile embedded products, with a significant portion of this revenue forecasted on the cusp between Q3 and Q4. The ramp timing of several mobile embedded products, along with the market success of our customers\u2019 mobile products, are key variables in where we land in our forecasted 2015 revenue range.", "For the third quarter, we estimate our revenue to be in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion. We continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin for the second half of the year to be in the range of 40% to 43%. Compared to Q2, we expect the key factors impacting second half gross margin to be an increased mix of mobile embedded sales, which will have a negative impact on gross margin, and a slightly weaker yen to dollar rate coupled with higher sales volume, which will have a positive impact.", "For Q3, we expect the yen to dollar rate in cost of sales to be approximately 120. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses in Q3 to be between $335 million and $345 million, and continue to expect full year 2015 non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately or slightly below $1.4 billion. ", "For the second half, we expect our non-GAAP other income and expense to be approximately break-even and our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at approximately 32%. Our 2015 fab and non-fab capital investment forecast remains at $1.4 billion, with $709 million purchased in the first half, and our 2015 forecasted cash usage for capital investments remains at approximately $500 million, with $190 million used in the first half. ", "To conclude my remarks, we look forward to delivering sequential growth in revenue and earnings in the second half of the year as we continue to focus on improving our execution and strengthening our product portfolio. We\u2019ll now open the call for your questions.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Judy. Thank you, Sanjay. Shaneal, can we open up the floor for questions please and if I can ask the callers to limit themselves to one question and a brief follow-up, that would be very appreciated and we will do the Q&A until about 3 o' clock.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, this is Gabrielle calling in for Ambrish, thanks for taking my question. So you mentioned in the call that earlier that you said you expect the big growth in 2016 to be lower than \u201815, so what are your assumptions in terms of the wafer growth that the X3 makes and also from a tech transition? And also what percentage of the 3D NAND wafers do you expect in 2016 for SanDisk versus the industry?", "Judy Bruner", "Let me start that and give you some of those assumptions. First of all, our wafer capacity today at SanDisk is just shy of 3 million wafers per year. And that's inclusive of the 5% increase in wafer capacity that we just added in 2015. We have not made a final decision yet for 2016 as to new wafer capacity. However, it is most likely that we will add a small amount of new wafer capacity likely in the single-digit percentage range, similar to the last two years. And most likely that that will be a mix of 2D wafers and 3D wafers.", "In terms of X3, our X3 mix remains over 50% of our sales, and we expect that our X3 mix will increase, both due primarily to our mobile embedded products as well as our client SSD products. And that's factored into our expectations as well. And of course we are planning to begin the transition of some of our existing capacity to 3D in 2016.", "In terms of percent of capacity that is on 3D, I believe that was another of your questions, our expectation is for the industry that the industry will likely exit 2016 in the range of 15% to 20% of wafer capacity on 3D. And our expectation is that we will likely be around the low end of that range.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, thanks. That's very helpful. And on the -- as a follow up, your client SSD was down to about 10% of total, much lower than before. And would you call this a bottom, and do you expect the revenues to improve from here?", "Judy Bruner", "We do expect to increase our client SSD revenue from here, yes. As I mentioned, we did see increases with our other OEM customers in the second quarter, and we expect to grow that revenue and grow our share in client SSD going forward.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.", "John Pitzer", "Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Sanjay I guess my first question, I know it's a little bit premature because it doesn't come up until next year, but I'm kind of curious as to how you think we should think about the royalty renegotiation scheduled for next year with Samsung, especially as the industry moves towards 3D?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We don't comment on loyalty negotiations for future years, of course, each renewal of the license does require a new set of negotiations and they tend to be over extended period of time. And in the past, in certain cases, there has been litigation involved as well. So beyond that, I cannot comment at this point.", "John Pitzer", "Thanks. I appreciate that color. And then Sanjay, clearly the back half of the year is being helped by mobile, I'm just wondering if you can help us better understand the enterprise market for the back half of the year, and what kind of milestones should we be thinking about as you guys progress towards the goal of increasing sort of your exposure there and your profitability there?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "With respect to the enterprise market, you know we are very much focused on strengthening our product portfolio and rebuilding our execution in that area. I'm pleased with the progress that we are making in the SATA area where our 15 nanometer 2 terabyte SATA that's in qualification stages with multiple customers and we expect revenue contribution later in the year from that solution.", "Similarly with PCIe, continue to make good progress with our 1 Y nanometer PCIe solution with captive memory, and those are in qualifications, and also already qualifications with various customers but also starting to ship in the channel. So good progress there as well. And I spoke about the SAS solutions as well.", "So in Q2, we did better than what we had expected on enterprise. In Q3, we may be flattish to somewhat down in enterprise. Q4, I would expect revenue to increase again. And we have said before that in 2015, overall, we expect year-over-year increase in enterprise revenue compared to 2014, and I expect year-over-year increase in enterprise revenue in 2016 as well.", "So we continue to advance our product solutions roadmap making good progress there. This work will continue through 2016 timeframe as well. And I talked about our future converged platform in details in my prepared remarks as well.", "And enterprise really remains an exciting opportunity for us. Going from a 4 billion TAM in the industry last year to we project about 8 billion TAM in 2018 timeframe. And is certainly the long-term play for us and we're absolutely making the investments and making good progress toward our objectives of regaining momentum and working toward strong leadership position in this market.", "John Pitzer", "That's helpful. So, maybe I could sneak one more in for Judy. Could you just talk about a little bit the inventory direction going into the September quarter? Is the revenue growth all coming from sort of an accelerating bit growth or do you expect inventory draw down into the back half of the year? If you could help me understand that dynamic, that'd be helpful.", "Judy Bruner", "Sure. Well, as we mentioned we just completed the incremental wafer capacity so that will provide more inventory for us in the second half. And we expect to continue to hold our inventory at the higher end of the 10 to 12-week range that I've talked about in the past. We're doing that consciously because we want to ensure that inventory shortages don't impair our ability to gain share and to improve our financial performance.", "And that also plays into us purchasing some increased amount of non-captive. We recognize that that non-captive weighs somewhat on our gross margin. But we think that's the right tradeoff right now as we're trying to improve our financial performance for the long term. So I expect inventory will remain at the higher end of that 10 to 12-week range.", "John Pitzer", "Helpful. Thanks a lot, guys, and congratulations on turning the corner.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Srini Sundar with Hambrecht & Summit.", "Srini Sundar", "Hi, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Sanjay, what kind of postmortem analysis did you do on your 1Q and 2Q? And what are the changes that you've implemented so that you don't get surprised in the future?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So we discussed this at length in our April call. We went through the various product issues in terms of execution, as well as in terms of some of the market shift that we experienced. And we absolutely are addressing those. And I reported on some of the progress we are making in those areas in terms of enhancing our execution and strengthening our product roadmap, whether it be with respect to the requalification effort that's going on with customized solutions for SSD applications, albeit for SAS, 12 gig, next generation 15 nanometer roadmap or 2 terabyte SATA 15 nanometer drives or next generation PCIe solutions.", "So we are \u2013 really, the whole company is very much focused with the leadership really very much targeting rebuilding our momentum here with solid execution. And we talked about the organization changes that we made in the last April call. And I believe those changes are already starting to bear fruits.", "Srini Sundar", "Thank you. And as a follow up, do you have any plans to develop UFS format NAND? And for eMCP, do you propose to have agreements in place or you will mainly depend on third parties?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So with respect to UFS, as you know that it is an interface that is being used in Samsung high-end phones. And at this point, we are not seeing yet broader adoption beyond that. However, it is a trend that we continue to monitor carefully. We are offering today eMMC solutions, the discrete eMMC as well as eMCP solutions and of course customized solutions for embedded mobile market.", "And this is the best part of that market. We are monitoring the UFS trends. UFS does tend to have cost and certain power considerations, but we'll be adequately prepared to adjust the UFS market as it builds up in the future. But we are really, still, as I mentioned, continuing to evaluate this market opportunity for the future.", "And with respect to eMCP, we have said several times in the past that we do address this market in a pretty strategic fashion and we do have a couple of sources of DRAM supply to address this. And this is certainly an important market for low-end and mid-range budget smartphones.", "Srini Sundar", "Thank you so much and congratulations on a good quarter.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company.", "Timothy Arcuri", "Hi, thank you very much. I had two. I guess first of all, Judy, is there some way that you can sort of strip out the effect of the rise in inventory as it relates to gross margin? So what would gross margin have been had inventory been flat?", "Judy Bruner", "I'm not sure that I can answer it quite that way. But I would tell you that we're making progress in terms of inventory related charges, and our inventory related charges are lower than they were in the last quarter. Of course, carrying more inventory does weigh somewhat on gross margins, but the bigger factor, as I already mentioned, is that we are carrying and using a higher amount of non-captive memory in that inventory. So that's the bigger factor in terms of impacting the gross margins.", "Timothy Arcuri", "Got it, thank you. And then I know you've previously said that your full year cost decline would be in the range of down 15% to 25%. Can you talk about that again? Do you still feel good about that? And maybe are you -- at this point since you're halfway through the year, do you feel like you're going to be toward the lower end of that range or toward, say, the higher end of that range for the year? Thanks.", "Judy Bruner", "I do still expect that for the full year of 2015 we will be in that range of 15% to 25%. And I expect that in the second half of this year, we will have a higher contribution from 15 nanometer and also from X3, which will both be helpful in our cost reduction statistic for the full year.", "Timothy Arcuri", "Thank you so much.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.", "Mark Delaney", "Good afternoon and thanks very much for taking the questions. For the first question, I was hoping we could revisit the enterprise SSD topic. And you did a good job of outlining a number of the product qualifications that you have underway. And I understand that the prior target to hit $1 billion of revenue enterprise SSD was pushed out. As you guys look into 2016, given all the engagements that you have underway, do you think $1 billion is a revenue level that you can reach in 2016 now? Or is it still going to take some -- a longer period of time potentially to get back to that level?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We are not putting a specific timeframe for $1 billion target. We certainly target to achieve it in the future. In 2016, as I said previously, we definitely expect year-over-year revenue growth in enterprise business as well. As we continue to rebuild momentum in our enterprise roadmap here and continue to broaden our engagement, this is certainly an area where we will continue to grow in the longer term. And this is an exciting growth opportunity for us.", "Mark Delaney", "Okay, that's helpful. And then for a follow-up question, on 3D NAND, now that SanDisk is farther along with its own product development, can you just talk about your degree of confidence in being able to ramp that product in manufacturing with good yield? And then any update you can provide and any sort of quantification you may be able to help us with just comparing the cost per bit of your 3D NAND solutions relative to what you believe the industry competition is doing?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So with respect to 3D execution, there the technology execution continues to be on target with the timeline that we had outlined long time ago, several quarters ago, with pilot line production starting this year and initial pilot line production output going toward internal samples. And then commercial production starting in 2016 timeframe.", "And I believe that our 48-layer architecture for 3D NAND technology will position us very well in terms of cost competitiveness in the industry. We have always said that our 15 nanometer 2D NAND node is the lowest cost node in the industry this year, bar none. And bar none means any -- compared to any other 2D technology or 3D technology that is there today. And similarly, with our focus on continuing to have cost leadership, I believe that our 48-layer will position us well next year as well. Of course 15 nanometer will continue to be the work horse in terms of vast majority of bit production for us in 2016 timeframe as well.", "Mark Delaney", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities.", "Monika Garg", "Thanks for taking my question. Judy, you talked about that your expectation that 3D NAND still be about 15% to 20% of industry by end of 2016. Do you expect this to be new capacity added by NAND vendors or you think mainly it's going to be conversion of something in NAND capacity?", "Judy Bruner", "I think a very large portion of it is going to be conversion of existing capacity. There is some new, but I think the vast majority would be conversion of capacity.", "Monika Garg", "Then shifting gears to the enterprise, on the PCIe, what is your growth expectations for 2015 and 2016 for the market and where do you think your PCIe market share could be end of 2016?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "In terms of PCIe market, we have said earlier that in 2015, in terms of industry TAM, that has somewhat stalled, again, given the shift from PCIe to SATA that we have discussed in detail in the April call. Certainly as PCIe solutions get to lower price points enabled by captive flash memory as we discussed, as well as by greater deployment of NVMe solutions in the future, PCIe TAM will resume growth. We expect PCIe TAM to increase in 2016 compared to 2015. And PCIe is going to be very attractive in hyperscale markets with its low latency capability and high capacity, the high op capability that it provides. And PCIe TAM 2015 onward we believe will continue to grow very nicely.", "Monika Garg", "Thank you.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "If we look at 2018 time frame, SAS TAM for enterprise to be pretty much equal to PCIe TAM. And the SATA TAM by that time will become somewhat smaller compared to the SAS or PCIe TAM. So nice quarter ahead for PCIe 2015 onward.", "Monika Garg", "Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.", "Mehdi Hosseini", "Thank you. I want to focus on the 3D NAND. Sanjay, two questions for you. When you look at how you have developed the BiCS technology, what are the key assumptions you're making? And I'm asking you to better understand how the differences in BiCS and other technologies are out there, the technologies behind 3D NAND are going to evolve. Do you see a major difference in actual product performance, or is this going to be a differentiating factor for SanDisk ? And I have a follow up.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "So 3D technologies, as they're known, do give at the memory cell level, at the memory architecture level, do give certain benefits with respect to lower power, as well as greater performance and the cell distribution. And of course, specific technology implementation of 3D technology can affect that. So, at this point, we are not really providing specific details of our 3D technology other than that it is a 48-layer technology and we are the first ones in the industry to announce that technology, and expect others to be going toward higher layers in the future as well in order to make that technology become cost effective compared to 2D technologies. So that's all we are really prepared to share at this point with respect to details of our technology.", "Mehdi Hosseini", "Sure. And then as you go to 48 and 60-layer, how should we think about the difference in total bit per wafer for your 3D 48 or 60-layer versus your 15 nanometer planar?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "Right. So what we have announced so far is 48-layers, and of course in the future years, as you would expect, 3D technology will go to higher number of layers here. But the timing of that, or the number of layers have not been disclosed yet. 3D technologies of course compared to a 2D technology will provide particularly let's say 48-layer technology compared to a 15 nanometer 2D technology will provide more gigabyte per wafer. But again due to confidentiality reasons, at this point, we are not disclosing the specifics of how much more gigabyte per wafer. However, obviously that is baked into our estimations of -- when we talk about the industry, supply bit growth next year being less than what it is in 2015. Our estimation of 3D RAM, as well as 3D gigabyte gain per wafer versus 2D is all baked into that bit growth estimation for next year.", "Mehdi Hosseini", "I ask the question because if you're going to recognize revenue in the second half of \u201816, do we have any idea how to think about the gross margin impact?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "We have always said that we will bring 3D into production once it becomes cost competitive with 2D memory technology.", "Mehdi Hosseini", "So when is revenue recognized, we should feel that your technology, even at 48, should be accretive to the bottom line?", "Judy Bruner", "Our 48-layer -- the way I would think about it is that our 48-layer 3D technology will enable us to continue our cost reductions in a similar fashion to in the past.", "Mehdi Hosseini", "Okay, very helpful. Thank you.", "Judy Bruner", "But I don't view it as a step function, I view it as continuing the scaling of our technology.", "Mehdi Hosseini", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Mark Newman with Bernstein.", "Mark Newman", "Hi, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on a strong improvement on the quarter. My question is on -- twofold, one is on the enterprise and second is on the retail portion. So you mentioned enterprise performance better than you expected. And looking at the retail mix or rather I should say the renewal mix has increased substantially. So first of all on the enterprise side, you mentioned a number of product improvements, the PCIe with captive NAND, the 2 terabytes SATA and a few other things. But as far as I can see, correct me if I'm wrong, these are not impacting revenue in Q2? Could correct me if I'm wrong? And if so, what is driving the improvement in enterprise solutions, I guess I didn't quite catch that, what is the core reason? Is it pricing related? Is it demand being better or is it share? So that's the first part of question.", "And then similarly, on removable, you've made substantial improvement to the mix there. And as I recall back in Q4 last year that was a big reason for the disappointment in Q4 was the removal mix was -- or removal in retail was very disappointing due to not the right bits. I believe it was not enough X3. And you had said at that time that problem was going to continue to Q1. So is this significant increase in Q2 a catch-up from I guess the mistakes or the issues of Q4 \u201814?", "Judy Bruner", "Okay, so first let me start with enterprise, and Sanjay, you can chime in if I miss something here. But on enterprise, our enterprise revenue did come down from Q1 to Q2. And so I want to make sure that that was clear. And the revenue contribution from the new products that we've just recently introduced, the 2 terabyte SATA product and the captive memory PCIe product is really second half 2016 in terms of revenue contribution. The PCIe captive has begun to ship in the channel.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "2015.", "Judy Bruner", "Sorry, 2015. Did I say 2016? 2015. So those are second half for the most part, second half 2015 revenue contribution. So enterprise --", "Mark Newman", "For both of them.", "Judy Bruner", "Yes, we've started shipping the captive PCIe product in the channel, but it's in qualification with OEMs.", "Mark Newman", "Got it, okay.", "Judy Bruner", "So the enterprise sales \u2013 the key here is enterprise sales were better than we had expected in Q2 primarily from SAS products. But the revenue was still down sequentially from Q1 to Q2. Okay in terms of --", "Mark Newman", "Okay, great. And then \u2013 yeah.", "Judy Bruner", "In terms of removable, of course removable is largely retail, but there are some removable products that are sold in commercial channels as well. But if I focus on retail for a moment, the retail revenue grew 4% sequentially from Q1 to Q2, and that was driven by seasonality. Typically Q2 is stronger than Q1, as well as some amount of share gain in retail. And as we said, we are over the supply issues that we experienced and hampered us particularly in the fourth quarter of 2014.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "And I'd just to add to the enterprise part of your question that while the enterprise revenue went down compared to Q1 as we had expected previously, but it did better as Judy mentioned and I had mentioned as well compared to our expectations. I just want to highlight that PCIe revenue in Q2 went up on a quarter-over-quarter basis.", "Mark Newman", "Great, okay.", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "In the enterprise PCIe.", "Mark Newman", "Yes, got it. And then I guess related to that for the removable and retail mix, should this 44 \u2013 so removable is now 44% of the mix, which I think is highest since I believe -- Q4 \u201813, I believe. Is this an anomaly due to catch up or should we consider this kind of new normal? Just trying to understand if this is just a lumpy catch up due to the missed production or the underproduction in Q4 \u201814?", "Judy Bruner", "It's really more the result of the decline in the client SSD business due to the loss of the large client SSD program that we've talked about. So it's really because that revenue came down and the enterprise revenue also came down sequentially, although did better than we had expected. Those are really the key factors in causing the removable portion of the revenue to become a larger percent of the mix. ", "And as we mentioned, we also expect the most significant amount of our growth in the second half of this year to come from embedded products. So that will also tend to then cause the removable percentage to decline somewhat.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Mark. Shaneal, we may have time for one, possibly two questions.", "Operator", "Okay, we'll take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.", "Joe Moore", "I wonder if you could talk about the captive \u2013 the non-captive part of the mix going up, what exactly is driving that, and what do you see that mix looking like going forward, and what's the margin ramifications of that?", "Judy Bruner", "As I mentioned the non-captive was 6% of our sales mix in the quarter, up from 2% in the previous quarter and 1% in the year-ago quarter. We consciously purchased non-captive memory in order to ensure that we would have no shortages as we address the demand going forward. And we expect to continue to utilize some amount of non-captive in the second half of the year, and again to ensure that shortages do not hamper our ability to gain share and to begin improving our revenue going forward. It is a drag on gross margins. But we're happy that our gross margin in the second quarter was better than we had expected, even inclusive of the non-captive impact.", "Joe Moore", "Okay great, thank you very much. And then with regards to the industry growth being above 40% now, higher than you thought before, what do you see as the biggest driver of the supply being higher for \u2013 both for you and for the sector?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "I think it really is our latest estimation of technology transitions by various suppliers in the industry, the mix of X2 and X3 technology estimations as well, it's primarily related to that.", "Joe Moore", "Great, thanks very much.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Craig Ellis with B Riley.", "Craig Ellis", "Thanks for sneaking me in. Judy, it sounds like versus three months ago, the growth outlook in the back half of the year is weighted more towards embedded and a little bit less towards retail, is that right? And if that's right, why is that?", "Judy Bruner", "I wouldn't say that the growth expectation or the mix of it has changed from what we were thinking in April to now. I think we just didn't talk so much in April about what would be driving the increase, sequential increase in the second half. But our embedded sales are the biggest component of that expected sequential increase. But we do expect the retail revenue to be seasonally stronger in the second half as compared to the first half. So that is a part of the sequential revenue growth as well.", "Craig Ellis", "Okay. And then just a broader question. There's been a lot of concern over the last month or so about in-demand and SanDisk has a unique view given the hundreds of thousands of stores that it ships products into. As you look across the retail business and look at the intensity of demand, can you just characterize some of the regions globally where demand is either tracking well and in line with expectations or where there might have been variances either on the upside or downside versus expectations in the quarter that you reported?", "Sanjay Mehrotra", "You know, there are certainly some pockets of weakness on the global retail markets. However, we have always said that the TAM for retail in general is declining year-over-year in single-digits, in mid-single digit rate, and that's because imaging is moving to the phones, to the smartphones. Therefore digital camera sales, of course are going down and associated with that, imaging card sales are going down as well. USB also is overall the market that is somewhat in a decline.", "Mobile cards, of course is a category that is one of the larger categories within retail and it does grow. But, of course, there are embedded phones where that have embedded solutions as well. So overall TAM for retail declining with certain pockets of weakness. ", "But SanDisk's focus is with our strong penetration in retail channels across the globe with our strong brands with a broad portfolio of solutions and very strong recognition of SanDisk's high quality of products in the retail brand. Our goal, of course, is to continue to gain share in the retail channels and use that to drive a strong position across the globe here. We mentioned that we, in terms of our retail share position, because of some of the supply challenges that we had in Q4 and Q1 timeframe, we lost some share. But we are back on track in terms of positioning our share gains well in the retail channels.", "Craig Ellis", "Thanks, Sanjay. And then if I could just lastly, Judy, the business managed a very nice decrease in pricing intensity in the second quarter. As you look at the business, are you comfortable with where pricing is now on a quarter-on-quarter basis or do you still feel like there's room for improvement as you look into the back half of next year?", "Judy Bruner", "Our expectation currently for the second half of the year is that like-for-like price decline will remain modest in the second half. Of course the price statistic that we report in any given quarter is heavily influenced by the mix of products that we sell. But overall, we feel good about the pricing environment for the second half.", "Craig Ellis", "Thanks, Judy. Thanks Sanjay.", "Jay Iyer", "Thank you, Craig. And folks that's all the time we have for today's call. We want to thank you for joining us. And a Webcast replay of today's call should be available on our IR website shortly. Thank you, again and have a good evening. Shaneal, you can formally close the call.", "Operator", "That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Welcome to Western Digital\u2019s fourth quarter financial results for fiscal year 2015. Presently all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session [Operator Instructions].", "As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. Sir, you may begin.", "Robert Blair", "Thank you, as we being I would like to mention that we\u2019ll be making forward-looking statements in our comments in response to your questions concerning, among others, our product and technology positioning. Customer acceptance of our SaaS SSD products our outlook for enterprise and SSD businesses, data growth and its drivers enterprise storage and our ability to address this space. Our non-PC business in the PC market demand and our ability to respond the demand changes. China's Ministry of Commerce matters, optimizing our business, anticipating contribution from our new businesses than our financial performance including our financial results, expectations for the September quarter and earnings expectations for the second half of fiscal 2016.", "These forward-looking statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially including those listed in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 12th, 2015. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events. In addition, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the non-GAAP measures we provide during this call the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the quarterly fact sheet that we have posted on our Investor Relations section of our website.", "We ask that participants limit their comments to a single question and one follow-up question. I also want to note that copies of remarks of today\u2019s commentary by our Chief Executive Officer and CFO will be available on the investor section of our website immediately following the conclusion of this call.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Milligan.", "Steve Milligan", "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. After my opening remarks, Olivier Leonetti will provide additional commentary on our June quarter performance and our outlook for the September quarter. Demand for our fourth fiscal quarter was lower than expected given a week PC market. In that context I am satisfied with our performance. We reported revenues of $3.2 billion non-GAAP gross margin of 29.8% and diluted earnings per share of $1.51. Our storage shipments for the June quarter were 56 exabytes up 2% year-over-year. Our results reflect strong product and technology positioning coupled with solid execution. Our enterprise SSD revenue more than doubled year-over-year to $244 million demonstrating the continued success and broadening customer acceptance of our leading SaaS SSD products. We expanded our footprint in the enterprise SSD space with the initial ramp of our new UltraStar PCIe NVMe offering. It is been qualified with several leading customers and we expect revenue from this product to increase throughout fiscal 2016. We saw strong demand for our high-capacity helium and 15K RPM 2.5 inch performance hard drives. Revenue from our video surveillance hard drives continued its rapid growth as we expanded our lineup of these purpose filed solutions. And we continue to see positive market reaction to the value proposition of our new active archive system. Our view of persistent data growth remains intact driven by mobility and the cloud. The outlook for enterprise storage business remains healthy and we believe we are well position to address this growing market space. Regarding PC market demand we believe it is prudent to remain cautious in the near term given the timing of the Windows 10 and Skylake launches. That being said we are seeing early signs of market stabilization. Leading us to believe that PC market demand could pick up towards the end of this calendar year. On more stable PC market demand environment coupled with continued strength in our enterprise business provides the opportunity for improving financial performance as we move through the fiscal year. In the mean time we will continue to be discipline to the management of our business while being ready to address unanticipated upside if it materializes.", "I would like to comment on the status of our discussions with China's Ministry of Commerce. Since our last earnings we believe we have made meaningful progress. We have met with MOFCOM several times to discuss their review process and a potential time table for them to complete their work. We have submitted a comprehensive report on the current market which we believe shows that the storage eco-system has evolved significantly in the last three years and that lifting the hold separate restriction will enhance competition, increase innovation and benefit customers. We have also met with several other stakeholders in China and shared our view on the benefits of lifting the hold separate. Based on our conversations with MOFCOM we believe that they are working steadily on several fronts and we are hopeful that they can conclude their evaluation of our application to lift the hol separate in the near future.", "Olivier will now provide a summary of our June quarter performance and our outlook.", "Olivier Leonetti", "Thank you Steve. Our revenue for the June quarter was $3.2 billion. We shipped a total of 48.5 million hard drives at an average selling price of $60. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 29.8% and operating expenses totaled $560 million. Tax expense for the June quarter was $27 million or 7% of non-GAAP pre-tax income. On a non-GAAP basis net income of $356 million or $1.51 per share. In the June quarter we generated $488 million in cash from operation and our free cash flow totaled $332 million. Our CapEx totaled $156 million of 5% of revenue we repurchased 2 million shares for $198 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed year end with total cash and cash equivalent of $5 billion of which approximately $700 million was held in the U.S.", "I will now provide our guidance for the September quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion, excluding the amortization of intangibles we expect gross margin percentage to be roughly flat with our June quarter.", "Operating expenses of approximately $575 million and accordingly we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.50 and $1.60.", "Operator we are now ready attend the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "And our first question is from Kathryn Huberty with Morgan Stanley.", "Kathryn Huberty", "Yes, thanks. I believe coming into the June quarter, you had expected a fixed cost absorption hit on gross margins. It doesn't look like inventory on the balance sheet came down in June. So just curious if you could walk through the gross margin drivers in September, and particularly, given the high inventory, why don't we see a hit on gross margin as you go into the next quarter?", "Olivier Leonetti", "So we had to manage in the June quarter various variables. First of all to your point fixed cost absorption was an issue because of the lower TAM and we were able to mitigate -- more than mitigate this negative effect through two factors. First of all mix up improvement and also management of our cost based.", "Kathryn Huberty", "Yes just a quick follow up on OpEx, which was down $30 million again in the June quarter. Where are those cost savings coming from, in light of the restrictions around MOFCOM, and do you still see the same net savings, to the extent that you get that MOFCOM approval, over the next couple of quarters? Thanks.", "Olivier Leonetti", "So two parts in your question, on part number one, most of the saving in the quarter is due to lower executive compensation or lower executive compensation in total due to obviously the performance of the company. These are the MOFCOM, the synergies we have announced are still intact, as a reminder we have indicated that synergy in OpEx would be in the range of 400 million a year and that COGS synergies would be material and on top of that number.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is open.", "Aaron Rakers", "Yes, thanks. One question, one follow-up, as well. Going back to Katy's question, when you look at the gross margin this quarter, which was quite impressive, considering a 120 down to a 111 million unit number for the industry, what is the impact to gross margin that you've seen, given the inability or given the deleverage from a fixed cost absorption perspective? If it weren't for the lower TAM, I'm asking what kind of gross margin could you have attained in this last quarter.", "Olivier Leonetti", "So the impact of lack of absorption is material right. We are not going to give any details of how much it was. But indeed it would have been a material increase in the margin rate.", "Steve Milligan", "The other thing Aaron to keep in mind which is that, obviously the part of the business that was weaker which is PC related, so our client business carries a lower margin. Yes there is absorption impact in terms of having less units. But the effect of having a lower amount of lower margin business naturally provides -- if you want to call it, accretion from a gross margin perspective. Because our software business whether it be from revenue or a unit or for that matter from an earnings perspective was entirely driven by a slower PC market.", "Aaron Rakers", "Okay. And as a follow-up, when we look into the back half of the year, I think last quarter we talked about a 40-60 split in terms of enterprise demand, particularly from the hyperscale and cloud guys. What's your current outlook relative to that for the second half on the enterprise side, and is that not a positive factor to consider from a mix perspective on gross margin going forward?", "Steve Milligan", "So the 40-60 split that I believe was talked about last quarter I think was on the CA call that is consistently what it's run over the last several years. We would expect generally speaking for that pattern to hold plus or minus few percentage points for this calendar as well. And then I\u2019ll ask Olivier to comment on the puts and takes in terms of gross margin for our September quarter.", "Olivier Leonetti", "So the statement about 40-60 is mainly exabyte statement. So relative to our guidance we are guiding to roughly flat, meaning it could be slightly up or slightly down. Obviously, we have many puts and takes which could unfold during the quarter. Enterprise could be stronger, PC demand could be stronger, that could be negative to the margin rate and we think that\u2019s roughly flat is as good as we can guide at the stage.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Joseph Wittine with Longbow Research. Your line is open.", "Joseph Wittine", "I understand the PC market is rough, but your shipments are eroding faster than the industry. You're down about 30% year-over-year. PC units down about low double digits. So curious why you're decelerating so much faster. What chunk of it is inventories, is been taken down, therefore you get some sort of snapback, versus how much is just the ongoing secular decline in hard drive attach rates within PCs? Any color would be helpful.", "Steve Milligan", "Yes so two comments on that and you\u2019ve hit on them. We don\u2019t have entire visibility to this all by the way. But we believe that there has been a meaningful inventory draw down both on -- throughout the supply chain from a PC perspective. So and we certainly from our own company perspective have been very careful to not over drive the market in terms of shipping too much inventory into our customers. And so we've seen a sharper decline in our client business than what we've seen from a broader PC perspective because of what we believe to be a meaningful thinning of the overall inventory supply, that\u2019s one factor.", "To what extent that\u2019s happen, that\u2019s difficult to determine. But clearly our customers do not want to have or do not want to run the risk of having, \u201cobsolete inventory\u201d in front of the Intel and the Microsoft transition. So that\u2019s clearly caused them to draw their inventory levels down. The second thing is that we naturally are going to decline faster than the broader PC market because of the increasing attach rate of solid state devices replacing hard drives, which is consistent of by the way with our expectations. So that helps explain at least some of the disconnect on our numbers versus the broader PC industry.", "Joseph Wittine", "That's helpful, Stephen. And I guess a follow-on would be what does guidance assume as far as PC inventories in the third quarter and what\u2019s the TAM baked in that as well?", "Steve Milligan", "If you look at -- let me give you some data points to contemplate. Obviously we have not seen Seagate\u2019s -- Toshiba's numbers published yet, so we don't know where they ended up. But we would expect that the TAM for last quarter to be somewhere between on 110 and 112 depending upon where Toshiba lands. The TAM that we are using for purposes of our guidance or assuming for purposes of guidance would approximate 115 million. The increase from -- let\u2019s just use 110 because it\u2019s round number, from 110 to 115, that increase is driven by two factors. Seasonal increase in gaming, seasonal increase in branded, that would imply that other segments of the market are flat from a unit perspective.", "And when you get into the PC market we would expect that to be roughly flat at least as it relates to hard drive shipments into the market from an Enterprise perspective, we believe that units will be roughly flat. Keep in mind one of the comments that we made is that we believe that there will be meaningful increase in terms of exabyte shipments that as we are mixing up the higher capacities and shipping six terabytes and eight terabyte, obviously the unit consumption gets affected by that such that the unit increase is more muted.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Rich Kugele with Needham and Company. Your line is open.", "Rich Kugele", "Just my two questions will be, first and foremost on helium. Can you give us a sense on how much of your enterprise business today is based on helium and competitively when you do come up against another offering that is more traditional based. Presumably you're coming in at a premium because of the --. So just competitively when you go up against someone else with more traditional drive and air based drive with helium. Can you just talked about your win rates there? Just understand that dynamic as we move to higher and higher capacities that are exclusively helium based.", "Steve Milligan", "Sure the first thing Rich is that I'm not going to provide any additional color on the volume of our capacity enterprise drives that\u2019s helium versus traditional in-air drives at this point. But obviously as we have indicated overtime, we'll be transitioning particularly when we move to the 10 terrabyte and things like that, the 6 terra byte is intended to be our last in-air product. So as customers mix up, larger and larger percentage of our business is going to be helium based. Relative to head-to-head competition, a couple of things to keep in mind. First thing is that we -- the customers that we\u2019re dealing with have pretty sophisticated total cost of ownership algorithms that allow them to look at more than just simply the price of the hard drive.", "And we recognize the fact that clearly the price of hard drive is one element. But when we factor in from a total cost of ownership perspective and we're going head-to-head at a similar capacity point we actually have pretty good win rates. And in some cases, obviously, we\u2019ve transitioned to the 8 terrabyte right now, we got a distinct advantage from that capacity perspective which sets us apart in terms of winning business.", "Rich Kugele", "And then in terms of the non-PC percentage of revenue. Do you have a sense for that might be exiting fiscal '16?", "Steve Milligan", "That\u2019s a good question Rich. And I dare to speculate, to tell you the truth because the lots of it will depend upon what happens with the PC business. So I don\u2019t think I want to try to forecast a number at this point. Because I would happily have it remain the same because that would mean that the PC business was actually looking a little bit better. But if we don\u2019t see the PC market pick-up than obviously our non-PC business is going to continue to increases as a percentage of the total. So that\u2019s a long non-answer to your question.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital. Your line is open.", "Ananda Baruah", "One for each Steve and Olivier, Steve just kind of following up on the last question just think out, kind of past this year into and even through '16. What is a prudent way for us to think about how you guys -- do you normalize exabyte growth? I know it might be -- there is a lot of moving part in the current environment. But every year your latest thought-process there would be helpful. Then I have a follow up, thanks.", "Olivier Leonetti", "So if you look at exabyte today, we see it to be easy, high single digit with some nuances as you go bilateral [ph] business, capacity enterprise was a big oversees focus. We would expect it to grow in the 50% range which is what we've observed on average for the last four quarters. Strong performance on that standpoint.", "Ananda Baruah", "And then Olivier for you just on the OpEx level to just sort of expect going forward. I believe last quarter before PC [indiscernible] that they did, that you are looking sort of at a like 590 plus or minus level depending on were in the year you are. You pulled that kind of cost this quarter. Although it sounds like maybe this was sort of a little on the prudent side. So would love to get your take on how we should think about OpEx level going forward.", "Olivier Leonetti", "So we guided to a lower number $575 million for the next quarter, it's probably a number we would stick to for the coming four quarter basic on the adjustment we have to do to our cost based on the time level.", "Operator", "The next question is from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Sherri Scribner", "I just wanted to ask your view and what you're hearing from your cloud enterprise customers at this point given the fact that a number of the big cloud providers Twitter, Amazon Facebook are all cutting their CapEx plan. You guys sound on the call to be very bullish on capacity growth. I just wanted to get your sense of what those company\u2019s plans are given their cutting their CapEx thanks.", "Steve Milligan", "Yes so let me talk about kind of them in general terms. The first thing is, which may sound very much like an obvious statement. We have a number of customers and relative to anyone particular period we may see relative strength or relative weakness in particular accounts and by the way, obviously part of our job from the management perspective is to manage whatever either call it segment or customer volatility from a demand perspective that we might happen to see. And so there is always going to be noise in that regard that we have to deal with.", "In general as an overall statement, we feel very good about our positioning from a product perspective from a technology perspective, from a customer perspective positioning standpoint and the numbers that we're looking at are relatively consistent. With our previous expectations and we continue to expect that in the back half of the year we're going to see pretty healthy pick up from an overall exabyte perspective and we'll see how that translate from a unit perspective as we ship higher capacity drives. But it should also drive a pretty healthy first half to back half revenue increase in terms of its contribution to our overall business.", "Sherri Scribner", "And just thinking about that exabyte growth accelerating in back half of the year. What is driving is that? Is that further builds by some of your customers is that something that you see sort of seasonally? I\u2019m just trying to understand that a bit better. Thanks.", "Steve Milligan", "Let me give you a little bit of context. So if you look over the last roughly three years particularly in that space about 40% of exabyte shipments are in the first half of the year about 60% and in the second half of the year. We're expecting roughly speaking that kind of a split to continue and I would suggest that\u2019s just due to normal seasonality in terms of the nature of that business. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that there is an acceleration per say in that segment from a year-on-year perspective.", "Operator", "Next question is from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Wamsi Mohan", "Headcount is down 8% year-on-year. Can you talk a little bit about where those adjustments were made, how much was manufacturing related versus maybe G&A that can persist into the back half? And I have a follow up.", "Steve Milligan", "The majority of that is our manufacturing workers in Asia. All of it.", "Wamsi Mohan", "And on the MOFCOM side you sound more optimistic today versus 90 days ago, first, am I correct in assuming that? Clearly you\u2019ve been meeting them throughout this process. So what's giving you an increase confident of a speedy resolution? And if you don\u2019t have a resolution six months will you be like negatively surprise?", "Steve Milligan", "The comments that I made in my prepared remarks, frankly speaking, kind of stands on its own in terms of the commentary. And the reasons why we believe that or that we\u2019re hopeful for a decision in the near term. So I'd refer you back to my script for a detail in terms of that. Your question with regards to would I'd be surprise if we didn\u2019t have a decision before the end of the year is obviously a tricky question. I don\u2019t know if I would say surprise, but obviously I would be surely disappointed if we didn\u2019t have a decision by them.", "Operator", "The next question is from Steven Fox from Cross Research. Your line is open.", "Steven Fox", "I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your SSD business. It has some fantastic growth over the past year. What are the key drivers and how do you think your growth is comparing to the marketplace at this point?", "Steve Milligan", "Sure couple of comments on that, the first thing is that from an overall growth perspective we do believe that we are gaining market share in that market. And so we are exceeding industry growth averages. The lion\u2019s share -- this is consistent with the past, the lion\u2019s share of revenue continues to be related to our SaaS based SSD product. The one really encouraging thing from my perspective is that we're beginning to see a much more meaningful contribution from our PCIe NVM product. It's still relatively small compare to the 244 but we saw a nice pick up from counter in Q1 into counter Q2, we\u2019re gaining increasing momentum and we expect, as I indicated in my prepared remarks that the revenue contribution from those products will continue to increase as we move through fiscal 2016.", "Steven Fox", "And just as a quick follow up given where units are right now and some of the average capacities you\u2019ve talked about. What are the chances that you would consider writing down some capacity at certain parts of the production process in the near term?", "Steve Milligan", "So we are constantly evaluating and constantly looking that. And you can see that we have taken -- as the market has decline -- let's be clear, the market has decline significantly over the last two or three years. And we have consistently evaluated our investments and our capital levels as we've seen the market come to new and different level. We are going to continue to do that and continue to take actions to make sure we right-size not only our manufacturing capabilities, but also our investments from OpEx perspective to make sure that we do our best to provide appropriate financial performance for our shareholders.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Christian Schwab, Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Your line is open.", "Christian Schwab", "I have a follow up similar to that line of thinking. Our non-PC revenue has been your revenue, I should say is been fairly consistent and about 2 billion to 2.2 billion a quarter for the last few years. When we look at your gross profit dollar generated, I would assume that it\u2019s higher than then the non-PC revenue. Meaning that 70% plus of your gross profit dollars are generated a non-PC product. Is that fair?", "Steve Milligan", "Without confirming the exact the number that you quoted. The non-PC areas of our business carry a higher gross profit than our traditional client business and so if 65% of our revenue contribution is non-PC, then obviously the profit contribution in that is greater.", "Christian Schwab", "Right, so I guess where I\u2019m going with that is if we get MOFCOM approval and we started to right down more capacity in notebooks and PCs. We're going to print cash for as long as that non-PC revenue doesn\u2019t dissipate, right?", "Steve Milligan", "Yes, we would believe that there will be significant synergies as a result of the lifting of the hold separate, which will not only benefit our company, our shareholders. But we'll also be able to benefit consumers in the form of more competitive pricing.", "Christian Schwab", "And if you look at the 76,000 people we got left working for us. Can you remind us the break out of those employees roughly?", "Olivier Leonetti", "There is nothing to remind you off, we've not broken that out.", "Christian Schwab", "You haven\u2019t broken that out?", "Steve Milligan", "No.", "Operator", "The next question is from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.", "Keith Bachman", "Olivier, can you help with -- what was the charge for the -- there is a 104 million charges this quarter that was reversed out from GAAP to non-GAAP. What was that for?", "Olivier Leonetti", "The modernity of that, all of it was due to us resizing our business into [indiscernible] the current time level. So all of it is the adjustment of our supply chain, end-to-end to, face the new reality.", "Keith Bachman", "So was it a permanent reduction the fixed cost base, just trying to understand was it a onetime -- truly a onetime event or does that carry forward and reduce your fixed cost?", "Olivier Leonetti", "That will be one adjustment we have done among others in the past and this one will carry its impact going forward indeed.", "Keith Bachman", "Steve one for you then, in terms of MOFCOM is it a zero sum game and what I mean by that is, this has been puts and takes here. It feels like it ebbs and flows over the last year and change. What happens if the Chinese Government just doesn\u2019t say anything and this goes on for perpetuity? And what I mean by that is this does Western Digital have plans -- contingency plans whereby they could reduce cost even without the hold separate that would at least [Audio Gap] or do you need to get MOFCOM to really take your cost structure meaningfully lower from this juncture?", "Steve Milligan", "We're going to continue to evaluate all of our option. But I think it's very dangerous, Keith, for me to speculate as to what we would do if we have no response from MOFCOM.", "Keith Bachman", "Okay fair enough. Nice job on the gross margin guys.", "Operator", "The next question is from Monika Garg from Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.", "Monika Garg", "Could you maybe talk about what was like-for-like pricing in the quarter and what do you expect in the September quarter as well?", "Olivier Leonetti", "Monika nothing half of beyond entry [ph]. The market remains competitive and we wouldn\u2019t characterize this quarter, the one we closed very differently from the prior one. And we would expect that to prevail in the September quarter.", "Monika Garg", "As a follow your enterprise revenue has grown significantly this year. Is it fair to think in fiscal 2016 that could be greater than $1 billion business?", "Steve Milligan", "I don\u2019t know if we provided a specific estimate in terms of what our revenue level will be. But we continue to expect that we're going to see nice growth in our overall enterprise business.", "Operator", "The next question is from Bill Shope, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Bill Shope", "Could you give us some color on how we should think about margin transfer enterprise SSD business relative to the enterprise HDD business? I know you don\u2019t give the absolute levels, but if you could just give us some color on how we should think about the trends relative, particularly now that they\u2019re becoming much more significant part of the overall business.", "Steve Milligan", "What we said in the past and it continues to be true is that, the gross margin generally speaking for our SSD business is below the corporate average, I mean it\u2019s still very good margin, but below the corporate average. But it is clearly above the corporate average from a return on investment capital. Because we don\u2019t have the same form of, call it, vertical integration in investments.", "Bill Shope", "And then I guess looking at your capital allocation obviously you continue give back cash to shareholders each quarter. But do you see any incremental change to the capital allocation plans or near term activity given the recent fell off in the stock price and some of the concerns that have pressured the stock relative to the market recently?", "Olivier Leonetti", "So we look at capital allocation regularly. But we still believe that even at this point in time giving back 50% of our free cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends and buyback is a balance approach. To reward our shareholders today but also to keep rewarding our shareholders tomorrow, to keep investing in the business and we mentioned some attractive investments, helium, enterprise SSD and active cloud being a few examples.", "Operator", "The next question is from Joe Yoo with Citi Group. Your line is open.", "Joe Yoo", "Steve, I wanted to ask more general question about mission critical performance wise if I could. So I know you don\u2019t break out performance versus near-line. But if you look at industry data, mission critical has been fairly flat and actually it's been growing in the last couple of quarters. And you\u2019re in sort of an interesting position where you can -- you sell both the SaaS drives and SaaS SSDs and which are largely viewed as substitute. So can you help us understand why fast drives remains so resilient despite such strong adoption from SSD?", "Steve Milligan", "Are you telling relative to us or in general?", "Joe Yoo", "Either, I mean but may be you can start with WD.", "Steve Milligan", "Well if relative to us, if you remember we had a hole in our portfolio where we did not have a competitive 2.5 inch small form factor SaaS hard drive. We now have a competitive product and so in that space, which albeit a relatively small part of the performance enterprise market we've been able to pick up some share in that space just by having a competitive product. So that\u2019s help strengthen our relative performance, from a performance enterprise standpoint. From a standpoint of SaaS versus -- not SaaS, enterprise SSD versus a small form factor hard drive, right now we're not seeing much cannibalization per say, we do expect that there will be cannibalization overtime. And it tends to be work load driven in terms of the way the systems are configured. So there hasn\u2019t been cannibalization so far, but we do expect that that will happen in the future and that there will be some cross-over between 2.5 inch 15k drives and SSDs in the future.", "Joe Yoo", "And what is the critical factor in actually making that happens? Is it pricing, as in the cost of NAND?", "Steve Milligan", "Pricing and also work load driven, in terms of how the systems are configured.", "Steve Milligan", "Thank again for joining us today. In closing I want to thank all of our employees and suppliers for their commitment and outstanding execution and our customers for their continued business.

With me today are Mike Cordano, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Olivier Leonetti, our Chief Financial Officer. ", "After my opening remarks, Olivier will provide additional commentary on our September quarter performance and our outlook for the December quarter. This is an important time for Western Digital. We have announced several transformational developments over the last few weeks, including the planned investment in our company by Unisplendour, the decision by MOFCOM, and planned acquisition of SanDisk, coupled with our continued strong execution in the business, I am very excited about the company\u2019s future and our ability to create long term value for our customers, shareholders and employees. ", "We are proceeding with our integration in to a single company, as outlined in the MOFCOM decision, and we are submitting our applications for the regulatory reviews associated with the SanDisk acquisition, and Unisplendour investment. We look forward to keeping you informed of our progress. ", "Turning to the September quarter, industry demand for hard drives was moderately higher than expected, driven primarily by strength in demand for 2.5 inch devices for game consoles and notebook PCs. ", "We reported revenues of $3.4 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 28.9%, and diluted earnings per share of $1.56. Our storage shipments for the September quarter grew to 64 exabytes from 56 exabytes in the June quarter. These results reflect continued strong product and technology positioning, coupled with solid execution.", "Our enterprise SSD revenue grew significantly to $233 million, reflecting the continued success of our SaaS SSD products in an increasingly competitive environment. Additionally we continue to ramp our new UltraStar PCIe NVMe offering.", "Revenue from our video surveillance hard drivers also continued its rapid growth, as customers embraced our expanding lineup of these multipurpose or purpose build solutions. We continue to see positive market reaction to the value proposition of our new active archive system. We anticipate this new systems business will generate meaningful revenue next fiscal year. ", "We saw a good demand for our enterprise hard drives, especially our high capacity helium drives, with more than 1 million units shipped in the quarter. We are volume shipping our 8 terabyte helium drive and will be ramping our 10 terabyte helium drive in the year ahead. ", "Overall, demand in the high capacity space was somewhat softer than anticipated. This was due to absorption of previously deployed storage assets purchased earlier in the calendar year by some of our large customers. ", "Notwithstanding cyclicality within a given period, growth in the capacity enterprise sector will continue with a 35% CAGR and exabytes anticipated on an annualized basis through 2020. This is underpinned by the ongoing growth and data bank created and stored. ", "Looking to the PC market, we are continuing to see some signs of stabilization in demand, driven by innovation, refresh cycles and normalization of PC inventories. We believe we have the opportunity to improve our financial performance due to the integration synergies associated with the recent MOFCOM decision, coupled with our continued favorable mix of business. ", "Longer term, the acquisition of SanDisk and the investment by Unisplendour will help transform our company in to a storage technology leader with a broader set of products, deeper technology base, and an expanded addressable market. ", "Olivier will now provide a summary of our September quarter performance and our outlook. ", "Olivier Leonetti", "Thank you Steve. Our revenue for the September quarter was $3.4 billion. We shipped a total of 51.7 million hard disk drives at an average selling price of $60. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 28.9% and operating expenses totaled $567 million.", "Tax expense for the September quarter was $31 million or 8% of non-GAAP pre-tax income. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $366 million or $1.56 per share. In the September quarter, we generated $545 million in cash from operations, and our free cash flow totaled $394 million. Our CapEx totaled $151 million or 4% of revenue. ", "We repurchased 700,000 shares for $60 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $5.1 billion of which approximately $600 million was held in the US. ", "I will now provide our guidance for the December quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect gross margin percentage to be slightly up from the September quarter. Operating expenses of approximately $585 million, and accordingly we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.50 and $1.60. ", "Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. ", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "I have a question and a follow-up, just to start with, could you just talk about the benefit the MOFCOM approval have on your cash and rationability as you forward, and how do you think the timing of those benefits of flow and would be in sync with your P&L, and does MOFCOM help you get within the target of your cash conversion cycle of four to eight days. ", "Steve Milligan", "I\u2019ll take that and then Olivier can add a little bit of a color, and this is Steve. If you look at benefits that we expect from the revised MOFCOM ruling is that, first thing is that we expect to realize $400 million of annual operating expense savings and then we\u2019ve also commented that we\u2019ll have material cost synergies. We have not quantified what material means in terms of cost synergies. ", "Generally speaking, the 400 million of operating expense savings would be roughly equivalent to cash savings as our OpEx. The cost savings that we would realize, which have not been quantified would be a mixture of cash and depreciation, that sort of thing. So it\u2019d be kind of a mixture. ", "Olivier Leonetti", "Yeah let me add two comments; first of all most of the cash will be generated offshore. We commented on that 90% of the benefit would be generated outside US. And from a cash conversion cycle we believe we\u2019re going to have some improvements but I wouldn\u2019t bank on many days. ", "Steve Milligan", "I can comment on that because there\u2019s a little bit of perspective, the four to eight days we announced that I think it was back in September of 2002 or \u201903. It will help, sorry at this track of time, but you know shortly after the acquisition the composition of our business has changed dramatically since then particularly a lower percentage from a PC business which tended to have a higher cash conversion to more of an enterprise mix which has a slower cash conversion. So we\u2019re going to need to reset at some point what that cash conversion cycle from a business perspective should be for our company. ", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Got it, that\u2019s really helpful. Just as a follow-up could you talk about gross margin dynamic in the September quarter was up 60 basis points so you planned, mix looks like may be a part of it, but was there anything else especially from a pricing perspective that sort of impeded your gross margins. ", "Olivier Leonetti", "All of it was actually mix, higher mix of gaming and higher mix of notebook and branded products. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is now open. ", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus", "One question and one follow-up as well. Olivier, I think you had made a comment that your operating expense in the current quarter is expected to be 585. I just want to clarify that, and if that\u2019s true, just curious on what\u2019s the upper driver here in this current quarter, and again kind of going back to Amit\u2019s question, when can we start to actually see that OpEx come down as it relates to that MOFCOM. Is that over the next two or three quarters or is it further out? I think last week you had suggested that you should be through a lot of that by the time you get to that SanDisk closure. ", "Olivier Leonetti", "So different guidance for OpEx is a bit higher than our run rate due to incentive compensation. Following the December quarter, we would expect run rate OpEx to be in the range of 575 give or take before.", "Steve Milligan", "570.", "Olivier Leonetti", "575 give or take before MOFCOM synergies. Now in terms of MOFCOM synergies as indicated we will expect them to materialize between the next 12 and 24 months and would provide you an update on regular basis. ", "Steve Milligan", "The run rate OpEx free MOFCOM synergies is 570 million. ", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus", "But just to be fair, you are looking to drive that OpEx down and that\u2019s not going to happen. Should some of that start to happen before we even get to the 12 months, is what I am asking. ", "Steve Milligan", "The short answer is yes Aaron. What we haven\u2019t done which - let\u2019s keep in mind that prior to the revised ruling from MOFCOM we were precluded from doing any integration planning, and so we have begun detailed integration planning and all of that, and so we are not prepared at this point to indicate specifically a phasing or the timing of those OpEx synergies other than to indicate they\u2019ll take place over the course of the next 12 to 24 months. But clearly we\u2019re going to be looking at how we can bring those in as much as possible from a financial perspective while minimizing impact to our business. Okay. ", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus", "And then as a follow-up I\u2019m just curious on the capacity shipment trends. You talked a little bit about, it looks like you were down about 2% year-over-year in terms of total capacity shipped. Can you help us bridge what that capacity ship looks like between the PC business relative to your enterprise business and what\u2019s that [stranded] like. ", "Steve Milligan", " I am not sure I follow that question Aaron.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus", "I guess relative to the 35% compound annual growth rate that you reference on the enterprise side going forward, just curious of how that growth looks like over the past few quarters within the total capacity ship number that you report. ", "Steve Milligan", "I got it. So Mike\u2019s going to take that question. ", "Mike Cordano", "Hi Aaron, so I think the way to think about it, we still think the calendar year is tracking to the 35% number may be slightly higher. We saw a little bit of front loading in the calendar year of that, and so that\u2019s being absorbed in the comments that Steve made earlier as we get in to the second half. So I think that trend we\u2019re confident in that, and that\u2019s specifically around the capacity enterprise segment. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rich Kugele from Needham. Your line is now open. ", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "A couple of questions, first on the capacity enterprise side, obviously that spans more than cloud service providers. Can you just talk about to the capacity enterprise cloud service provider part of your exabyte shipments, and how you would expect to trend over the next 6 to 12 month as you move especially to 10 terabyte? ", "Steve Milligan", "So Rich I\u2019ll take that question. As you know, we try to stay away from talking about specific either customers or types of customers. Obviously cloud service providers are a meaningful part of exabytes shipped on our part. But the absorption that I eluded to in my prepared remarks was a mixture of both traditional enterprise customers, if you want to call it that, as well as cloud service providers. ", "Rich Kugele - Needham & Company", "Okay, interesting. And then post SanDisk now, is there anything that you were contemplating on the Hitachi integration that now needs to be altered because of the SanDisk integration. Are there like facilities that perhaps now you need to keep or does it change, what could have happened in any way. ", "Steve Milligan", "Well I think the first thing to keep in mind Rich is that, given the complimentary nature of the SanDisk and Western Digital transaction, it\u2019s a different kind of an integration in that regard. That\u2019s an important thing to contemplate. ", "Simplistically, the answer to your question is, no it doesn\u2019t really alter anything. There are some additional things that we\u2019ll have to think about that add a bit more complexity, for example, systems integrations and things like that. So we\u2019ll have to look at not only the pre-existing WD and HGST systems, but also what platform is SanDisk on and how do we kind of manage that process. ", "But other than a few items like that, we intend to more or less perceive full steam in terms of the integration on the WD/HGST side. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open. ", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Steve on your comments about absorption on the capacity side, can you help us think through either how much do you think incremental demand half core, half migrated in to the first half versus second half for the calendar year because of those purchases or alternatively how much of the absorption do you think we are through and what innings are we in in that, and I have a follow-up.", "Steve Milligan", "Well let me comment on it this way, one of the things that we talked about in our last earnings call and also I believe our largest competitor also commented on it is typically the, I\u2019ll call it the mix exabytes that gets shipped. You have about 40% that typically gets shipped in the first half of the year and 60% in the back half of the year. And if you look back, and that\u2019s calendar year, right, not our fiscal year. ", "And that percentages held kind of pretty consistent over a number of years. This year roughly speaking, we are looking at something that\u2019s more like 45 and 55. So that will help kind of dimension a bit. And we would expect that that absorption of capacity or exabyte shipped, that absorption will continue through the balance of this calendar year, and begin to, if you want to call it abate as we begin next calendar year. ", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "And then on the Nearline side, clearly you took some share over there. As you had some customers migrate to the 8 terabyte drivers, can you talk about what happened with the pricing on a like-for-like basis for the 4 and 6 terabyte and did that influence margins, thanks. ", "Steve Milligan", "Well the short answer is that, that\u2019s not something that we call that as a particular driver of our margin performance. I mean Olivier commented on the decline that we saw on our gross margin was driven entirely by mix, and that being a stronger mix of lower margin products namely drives the gaming console as well as 2.5 drives that go in notebooks, consistently have been below the corporate average. ", "That\u2019s what impacted our margin, and whether or not other thing impacted, we are not calling anything else specifically. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rod Hall with JP Morgan. Your line is open. ", "Rod Hall - JP Morgan", "I just wanted to ask about the regional trends particularly Europe but may be also the US. The European year-over-year growth deteriorating quite a bit in the quarter to minus 15% from minus 8 last quarter; so I wondered if you guys could give us a little color on what\u2019s going on there, is that just consumer demand deteriorating or there are other things happening. ", "And then same for the North American region, down 6% after being up 16.5. Is that just datacenter or cloud oriented stuff or can you give us a little bit of color on those regional trends. Thanks.", "Steve Milligan", "I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything particularly to call out other than Europe has been weak from call it a broader macroeconomic perspective. It\u2019s always difficult to draw conclusions from our geographic data because so much of our product is manufactured in Asia or is passed on to customers that manufacture in Asia, so it doesn\u2019t really speak to the end market, but we have seen some as you know and the macroeconomic situation in Europe has kind of impacted some of our more retail oriented business, but I am not sure I would call out anything specific beyond that. ", "Rod Hall - JP Morgan", "And the European drives I guess are more Europe linked is that correct? Whereas elsewhere you get more especially in Asia it leaks out in to other regions or is that the wrong way to see things. ", "Steve Milligan", "Well probably in Europe you\u2019re right, because there isn\u2019t a lot of manufacturing done in Europe, right. North American you get a little bit of a mix because there are some manufacturing our systems that may go elsewhere and certainly in Asia. But Europe\u2019s a little bit more of a true number. But Europe\u2019s been from a broader perspective weak for a while.", "Mike Cordano", "Yeah, you\u2019re not the only ones. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open. ", "Steven Fox - Cross Research", "Can you hear me okay?", "Steve Milligan", "Sure. ", "Steven Fox - Cross Research", "But not that great. Just one question just switching gears, could you talk about your solid-state drive business a little bit? I think you mentioned a little bit of capacity issues or rather competitive issues are increasing during the quarter and then relative to average capacities and some of the trends you mention in the enterprise, how do those relate to what\u2019s going on in SSDs, utility and to the rest of the calendar year. And that\u2019s all I had, thanks. ", "Steve Milligan", "We\u2019ve enjoyed through strong product execution etcetera a pretty strong market position in an enterprise SSD business. It\u2019s a very competitive market as I eluded to in my comments and quite simply, not for anyone particular issue or another other than just increased competition and we gave back a little bit of our share on in this past quarter.", "Steven Fox - Cross Research", "And just in terms of average capacities or how the business trends through the rest of the year?", "Steve Milligan", "Overall or enterprise SSD, specifically.", "Steven Fox - Cross Research", "Just enterprise SSDs.", "Steve Milligan", "That\u2019s nothing surprising we continue to see as product generation gets announced, we continue to see an upward trend in average capacity shipment. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from James Kisner with Jeffries. Your line is open.", "James Kisner - Jeffries", "So my question is just regarding seasonality, I believe on the June quarter call you guys talked about seasonality being abnormal because of just the depressed nature of client demand primarily. But just wanted to get update your thoughts, I\u2019d like you to comment ideally sort of effects MOFCOM just the seasonality of earnings in this fiscal after having a couple more quarters or at least another quarter under your belt. ", "Steve Milligan", "I don\u2019t know if I call it. If you look at seasonality, if you look at the client\u2019s business, client plus gaming which really drove most of the increase in TAM from calendar Q2 to calendar Q3, the seasonal uptick in that regard was pretty consistent with what we normally see. It\u2019s normally up anywhere from 6%, 7%, 8%, something in that kind of range, and that\u2019s kind of what we saw in those segments of the market. ", "The other things that\u2019s happened is that, while we used to see further increase in volumes in calendar Q4, that\u2019s kind of dissipated or gone away as our customers generally build earlier in the year and then they will put those on boats or longer transport kind of things to save transportation cost. ", "So the seasonality from calendar Q3 to Q4 which has been going on for a while is much more muted, hence our view of a flattish TAM going in to calendar Q4. ", "James Kisner - Jeffries", "I guess sort of still wondering here, you are obviously massively under shipping and market demand, and I think units are down 30% on the client side. I am just wondering if there is hope at all here to see more recovery to closer to end market demand. ", "Steve Milligan", "Well we\u2019ll have to see. We\u2019ve said this before, although we\u2019ve seen some signs of stabilization in the PC market, I would not necessarily characterize us as being particularly bullish on that segment. And we have seen, there was inventory draw down through the whole kind of supply chain that\u2019s impacted our business a little bit in terms of where we may be at a sync a bit in terms of what you\u2019re seeing from an overall PC unit perspective.", "And then additionally, we continue to see penetration of client SSDs in those systems, consistent with our expectations though by the way, but that further disconnects us from the overall unit numbers that you might see from a PC perspective. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. ", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "Hi guys this is Keith here, sorry if there\u2019s any background noise. But my question I want to focus back on the SanDisk still because I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to ask a question. More specifically I am still struggling to see how the SanDisk deal is creating shareholder value. One of the ten multiple companies is buying a 30 multiple company. ", "And Steve the question I want to pose to you if I could, I want to understand what your fundamental assumption is about the SanDisk (inaudible) as you look out over the next two to three years and how do you reach that conclusion particularly with some thoughts surrounding what I think about is the retail business or the replacement and card and then I have a follow-up also related to SanDisk. ", "Steve Milligan", "The short answer to your question Keith is do we expect the SanDisk business to grow overtime? The answer to that is yes. And we see growth opportunities won and helping to expand our broader footprint in terms of the enterprise SSD area where we think that not normally is that an area that\u2019s outpacing overall market growth but also a higher value opportunity to us. ", "We also think that there\u2019s growth opportunities in terms of client SSDs as well, certainly as it relates to our base business, and additionally we think that there is growth opportunity in terms of embedded solution [investor] things, so you\u2019ve got tablets, cellphones etcetera (inaudible). ", "Yes, related to the removables or the retail segment, that\u2019s a great business but it\u2019s not a growing business. So we fully understand and acknowledge that. ", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. And may be if I could ask my follow-up then on the cost side, during the conference call last week I think you articulated broader synergies call it $500 million, and if I look at the cost structure of SanDisk alone, I would have thought there would have been more on OpEx, but maybe I did understand the characterization because you\u2019re combining, maybe I didn\u2019t understand the characterization of the 500 million opportunity, but I would have thought the companies there\u2019d be frankly more opportunities to reduce costs over the next couple of years beyond 500 million. But if you could just flush that out a little bit and then I\u2019ll cease the floor.", "Steve Milligan", "Sure. So a couple of comments on that. So when we talked about $500 million of synergies related to the SanDisk acquisition, we were specifically talking about, that was within 18 months of the close of the transaction. We did not indicate that that was the total synergies. In other words we do think that those there are additional opportunities. We have not quantified those or publicly talked about those at this point. ", "The additional thing is that regarding that $500 million of synergies the lion share of that is related to the advantage that we would get by being vertically integrated as it relates principally to our enterprise SSD business. And there are some OpEx synergies but we have not quantified that breakout specifically. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. ", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Steve I think you said you thought of the TAM and the fourth calendar quarter would be roughly flat. I was hoping if you could provide some detail on the different markets you mentioned that the PC market appears to be stabilizing. Can you give us some sort of directional commentary on the different end market for HDDs.", "Steve Milligan", "Yeah, I\u2019ll give a little bit of color on that. So we would expect and these are pretty small changes though by the way. We would expect that we\u2019ll see some softening in terms of gaming demand as well as in notebook demand offset by a little bit better enterprise demand. Again these are subtle changes that drives some of our margin improvement because we\u2019ll get a little bit - when things play out the way we expect we\u2019ll get a little bit of the mix benefit as a consequence of that. ", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "And then I think you also mentioned in your commentary that the active archive system is expected to drive meaningful revenue next year. Can you help us understand what type of TAM you think that product has, what\u2019s the revenue opportunity for that product. Thank you. ", "Steve Milligan", "So as we define that the active archive TAM we see that is a multi-billion dollar total addressable market for that solution. There\u2019s both sort of currently defined version of that as well as we think a new green field opportunities to create market with that solution given its value propositions. So I would look at it as a multi-billion dollar market and growing at a fairly fast clip.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open. ", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities", "Steve question on SanDisk acquisition, running a dry business is quite different than running a leading edge memory technology business. So maybe could you talk about the plan to retain SanDisk (inaudible) R&D team, and any execution risk in the integration you see. ", "Steve Milligan", "So Monika, SanDisk has got some great people. We look forward to welcoming them to the team and we certainly intend to retain the talent that exists there, and certainly that talent that relates to those parts of the business that we don\u2019t necessarily have the same experience, and then that\u2019s certainly the semiconductor business. So we look forward to bringing them onboard. ", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities", "Do you see any execution risk in the integration?", "Steve Milligan", "Well there is execution risk in everything to be perfect, and the thing that I always focus the most on and investors will ask me often what do you worry about? I want to make sure that we everyday as a company dot I\u2019s and cross T\u2019s, and that\u2019s what we do better than any company on the planet and that\u2019s what we intend to do as we look to not only execute the WD/HGST trend integration but also as it relates to future integration of SanDisk. And so absolutely are there risks and we are going to manage that carefully and I am going to keep our teams intensely focused on that. ", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities", "And then given that Unis is entrusting 15% stake in WD, do you think it could add any regulatory risk for getting approval for the SanDisk acquisition?", "Steve Milligan", "Well we are proceeding with our application, in fact our application regarding [macifious] process that is in and has been expected. We were very careful as to how we structured that transaction and Unis\u2019s representation on our Board, and we feel pretty good about that and we\u2019re proceeding with regulatory review at this point, and we\u2019ll keep you posted as things progress.

But let me make this comment, our 10 terabyte drive which we haven\u2019t announced exactly when that will be available, its PMR based solution. And that\u2019s depending upon how you encounter our third or fourth generation helium drive.", "There have been a lot of learnings along the way, and that we have developed and so when you got a three or four generation lead on your competition that\u2019s fairly material lead. Now that being said, we fully respect our competition and we are not going to rest on our laurels, and we are going to keep marching forward. ", "Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley", "And then a question on inventory, you commented on PC channel inventory coming down. Obviously we can see your balance sheet inventory that came down, but where do you think the industry is in terms of both channel inventory which has historically been quite low in recent quarters and also OEM inventory their manufacturing hubs.

And as a follow-up to that, do you see a change in your driver especially SanDisk selling more of a hybrid product as a way to scale a rather niche segment of the market.", "Steve Milligan", "So let me comment on that, I think we see 3D as the next generation underlying media. We have plans to address products that are built on that in the future. So that will be part of our competitive profile and there are both of course economic benefit of that, but there are also product performance benefits in that architecture.

Just interesting in getting your view on if you\u2019ve seen this yet, if it\u2019s impacted unit placement in anyway and if you expect it to potentially have an impact going forward and that\u2019s it. ", "Steve Milligan", "You\u2019re referring to PC/OEM pricing?", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital", "Yeah on the SSD side, yeah PC related. ", "Steve Milligan", "I would just comment that I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen anything notable from our perspective.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Christian Schwab with Craig- Hallum Capital. Your line is open.", "Christian Schwab - Craig- Hallum Capital", "Steve I\u2019m just wondering just back to SanDisk if you can explain the big question we get is whether this is defensive strategy or an offensive strategy. In other word, is buying SanDisk your absolute best strategy for you to take on given your decline in industry or is more an offensive strategy in the fact that you believe exabyte growth is going to continue to grow and HDDs and solid-state drives will co-exist for an extended period of time, and therefore you are best suited to serve a customer that\u2019s also consolidating.", "Steve Milligan", "Yeah, so one comment and not to take offense to whether the question is phrased, but I don\u2019t know if I necessarily like the characterizing that is either offensive or defensive. This is a strategy that we\u2019ve thought about quite a bit. We think it is going to be good for our shareholders, good for our customers and it\u2019s going to allow our company and our business to grow. So if you want to characterize that as offensive then feel free to do so. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig- Hallum Capital", "Okay, that\u2019s fair. And then as you look at just the disk drive business Steve is my follow-up question, as we look out at a TAM that kind of follows a flat to low-single digit, given the mix and complexity of enterprise drives as well as bigger capacity branded drives being shipped, we\u2019ve made great progress on non-PC revenue as a mix of our business and actually over the last four years its modestly grown. Three or four years from now, do you believe that is the lion share of the percentage of revenue?", "Steve Milligan", "Yes. Now what percentage we\u2019ll have to see, and we certainly haven\u2019t called anything out publicly. But clearly the mix of our business in the traditional hard drive space is improving. And as it improves and as the PC related part becomes a frankly smaller and smaller part of our business, sooner or later there\u2019s going to be an inflexion point, it will begin to show improvement in revenues and in terms of the overall hard drive market as well as a better margin posture as it relates to that underlying business. So the hard drive business remains a great business, it\u2019s just a mix of shifting, right in a favorable way. ", "Christian Schwab - Craig- Hallum Capital", "I think several investors may be missing that. I appreciate you answering that. Thanks Steve.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs", "First question is on the strategy of the company in China going forward and post all that you\u2019ve announced should we expect any changes in how WD plans to do business or any other types of partnerships you may be lucky to form especially given that (inaudible) has other - as we make another investment in collaboration with US technology.", "Steve Milligan", "Yeah, nothing to talk about at this point. Obviously we are going to continue to evaluate and think through our go-to-market strategy in China. China as a market first up it\u2019s a huge market, it\u2019s a growing market, its evolving market. As you see some of the hyper scale guys there grow or telecom companies\u2019 etcetera, etcetera, we\u2019re going to have to look at ways that we evolve our go-to-market capabilities in that market, but nothing specifically to talk about now. ", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs", "Question on the gross margin, certainly when some of the preliminaries all started to come out from HDD companies with more of margins, there\u2019s a lot of concern in the market that there was an increase in pricing pressure. I know you commented that the decline at the WD was due to mix. ", "I was actually wondering if you could just talk about pricing trend within some of the segments can you translate on a quarter-to-quarter basis (inaudible) some pricing increases on some of the categories and also you talked about in the past being sell products especially Helium products on a [CCO] basis. So any color you could provide on pricing within segments would be helpful.", "Steve Milligan", "So relative to what we saw, again our margin decline on a quarter-on-quarter basis was purely driven and mix related. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything unusual from our perspective to call out on the pricing front. ", "Operator", "Our last question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Your line is open.", "Nehal Chokshi - Maxim Group", "Just a moderate question, days inventory that has been elevated for three quarters on a year-over-year basis, are we expecting that to continue to be the case?", "Olivier Leonetti", "Yes, we are managing our cash flow tightly and we would expect the flow not to have been achieved. So we think we can improve further on this metric. ", "Nehal Chokshi - Maxim Group", "And then this has been addressed to a certain extent, but I\u2019d like to try tease it out a little bit more. The $500 million of OpEx synergies with SanDisk, from my understanding there is three main bucket - I am sorry not OpEx synergies overall synergies. There are three main buckets from where this is going to come from PC express sales overlap, branded distribution, and interphase engineering. And if there\u2019s anything else I\u2019m missing please let me know, but can you rank order what you believe each of these are going to be in terms of magnitude.", "Steve Milligan", "Well the first thing is just to clarify we haven\u2019t called any of that out in terms of what you\u2019re talking about. I am not going to comment specifically on that. What we have said is that the lion share of that $500 million will be the benefit that we will get by being vertically integrated in our SSD business or existing SSD business.", "And there will be some OpEx synergies but we have not quantified that. And by the way the other thing is that we\u2019ve indicated the 500 million will be 18 months after the close of the transaction, which basically means that there will be further synergies beyond that 18 months period that we have to quantify publicly. ", "Operator", "We have one more question from Joe Wittine with Longbow Research. Your line is open. ", "Joe Wittine - Longbow Research", "I want to go off on the same topic. So the 500 million in synergies it seems like you\u2019re describing Steve as these are benefits from owning the raw material in-house. So is that really a synergy I guess or is that just kind of recapturing the profit that SanDisk would have brought on otherwise. I guess my question is, when you add one plus one does it equal two plus 500 million, right if you could just clarify that one more time, I think it would help. ", "Steve Milligan", "Well it\u2019s exclusive of the benefits that we\u2019ll get from the existing SanDisk business. So its additive to whatever you might happen to estimate that the existing SanDisk business would be able to generate. So its additive. ", "Joe Wittine - Longbow Research", "And then just be crystal clear, this includes no OpEx at all, no elimination of public company expenses that sort of thing, it\u2019s a very conservative number. ", "Steve Milligan", "I don\u2019t know if I used the word conservative, but it does include an estimate of some OpEx synergies. But we haven\u2019t quantified specifically what the OpEx versus the vertical integration benefits. We haven\u2019t quantified that difference. But we\u2019ve also indicated that we would expect that number to increase overtime beyond that 18 month period. ", "Operator", "At this time, we no longer have questions on queue. ", "Steve Milligan", "So thank you again for joining us today. In closing I want to thank all of our employees and suppliers for their commitment and outstanding execution, and our customers for their continued business. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. So that concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for participating, you may now disconnect.

Baruah - Brean Capital LLC", "Operator", "Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Financial Results for the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2016. Presently, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.", "Robert Blair - Investor Relations, Founder and Co-Principal", "Thank you, and good afternoon. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Such forward-looking statements are based upon management's current expectations and include known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which Western Digital is unable to predict or control, that may cause our actual results, performance or game plan or plans to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.", "This conference call does not constitute an offer to purchase, or the solicitation of an offer to sell, any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval in connection with the pending merger with SanDisk. Western Digital filed a Form-S4 Registration Statement with the SEC that includes proxy statements of SanDisk and Western Digital and a prospectus of Western Digital regarding the merger. After the joint proxy statement prospectus is declared effective, Western Digital and SanDisk will mail the definitive joint proxy statement prospectus to their respective stockholders. Investors and shareholders should read the joint proxy statements and prospectus carefully when it becomes available, because it contains important information about the merger.", "In addition, Western Digital, SanDisk, and their respective directors, executive officers, and certain other members of management and employees may be soliciting proxies from their respective shareholders in favor of the proposed transaction. You can find the information about Western Digital directors and executive officers in Western Digital's most recent proxy statement, and about SanDisk's directors and executive officers in SanDisk's most recent proxy statement. You may obtain a copy of these documents through the SEC's website or the Western Digital and SanDisk websites.", "Further references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the Quarterly Fact Sheet posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. I also want to highlight that the information provided during this call today regarding the savings realized as a result of the integration of our WD and HGST subsidiaries and the expected costs to achieve such savings are included in the Quarterly Fact Sheet posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "We ask that participants limit their comments to a single question and one follow-up question today. I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investors section sometime later after this call.", "And now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve Milligan, Chief Executive Officer.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me today are Mike Cordano, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Olivier Leonetti, our Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Olivier will give additional commentary on our December quarter performance and our outlook for the March quarter. He will also provide an update on the expected integration savings resulting from the lift of almost all of the restrictions MOFCOM had placed on our business.", "We continue to execute well as we manage our business within an increasingly challenging global economic environment. We reported revenue of $3.3 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 28.5%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.60. We also had strong free cash flow performance of $449 million, and our storage shipments for the December quarter grew to 69.1 exabytes. The HDD TAM in the December quarter came in somewhat below our expectations. The gaming sector was weaker and enterprise volumes were a bit lighter than expected.", "We anticipate weak demand in the March quarter, resulting in a hard drive TAM of approximately 100 million units. The main factors behind this forecast are the expected combination of seasonal and secular trends as well as increased caution among customers and end markets relative to challenging global economic conditions. Being able to integrate our HGST and WD subsidiaries and transform into one company affords us the opportunity to optimize our business model for both the near and long-term.", "We're taking a number of important steps in this context. We're reducing our cost base through a series of planned actions, including the elimination of redundancy in functions, products, and facilities. Olivier will provide additional detail in the magnitude and timing of the integration related savings, but let me cite a few examples.", "Last week, we announced the closure of our head wafer manufacturing facility in Otawara, Japan, one of our three head wafer facilities. We are streamlining our product roadmap by focusing our efforts to eliminate redundancy and optimize the products we offer, resulting in the elimination of a minimum of six programs. And we recently set our new leadership team with a plan to complete our new company-wide organizational structure in the June quarter. We believe this aggressive approach to reduce our cost structure will maintain and extend our cost leadership in the hard drive industry.", "Turning to the longer term, we remain focused on transforming Western Digital into one of the world's leading companies in the large, rapidly changing, and high-growth storage industry. We continue to believe in the innovated growth and the creation of data, in the amount of data being stored, and in our ability to create long-term value for our customers and shareholders.", "We continue to diversify our revenue base into higher growth areas aligned with cloud storage and the third platform of computing. This includes building on our track record of innovation in capacity enterprise, most recently with our leadership in Helium seal drives. Our Helium drives shipments totaled a record 1.5 million in the December quarter, including initial shipments of our 10 terabyte drive, our third generation Helium drive. First shipped by Western Digital in 2013, we are pleased with the success and wider adoption of Helium technology and enterprise IT, as it marks a shift for hard drive makers to deliver value-added storage solutions to customers, based on a value proposition of better total cost of ownership.", "Our enterprise SSD revenue grew to $270 million in the December quarter. While we continue to believe enterprise SSD will be one of our main growth drivers, we expect to see a pause in our growth in the March quarter, given typical seasonal factors in enterprise IT spending, and as we proceed through a SAS product transition. And we continue to see good traction in our Active Archive Systems business, with several wins in tier 2 cloud infrastructure, backup and archive applications, and other vertical markets.", "Regarding the SanDisk acquisition, we are pleased with the progress we're making in obtaining required regulatory approvals. It has always been our goal to close the acquisition as soon as possible. And as noted in our Form 8-K filing earlier this month, we have completed the FTC review in the U.S. I would also note that the FTC completed its review without issuing a second request, which we see as confirmation of our view that this transaction is pro-competitive. We've also received recent approvals from antitrust agencies in Singapore and Japan. Based on our work with other agencies around the world, we currently anticipate that the acquisition will close in the June quarter.", "I would like to emphasize the importance of the acquisition of SanDisk to our overall strategic plan. Once we close the acquisition, we will have the broadest set of products to offer our customers, a deep technology base across non-volatile memory and rotating magnetic media, and an expanded addressable market.", "On the Unisplendour investment, we and Unisplendour continue to work with CFIUS, as they review the proposed investment in Western Digital. CFIUS has not yet reached a decision on whether the investment is a covered transaction. We continue to believe that we have structured this investment carefully in order to avoid that result. Given CFIUS's heavy case load towards the end of last year, we asked to withdraw and re-file our notice in order to provide additional time for us to engage with them on our case. CFIUS agreed to our request and we re-filed in January. We now expect a decision from CFIUS sometime in February.", "Our strategic joint venture with Unisplendour to sell our storage systems in Japan is proceeding as planned. We successfully negotiated its terms, including operational and governance plans in late 2015. And with those complete, we are now in the process of satisfying certain closing conditions while simultaneously recruiting and staffing the JV. I'm very excited about the company's future and our ability to create long-term value for our customers, shareholders, and employees.", "Olivier will now provide his commentary before we take your questions.", "Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Steve. Our revenue for the December quarter was $3.3 billion. We shipped a total of 49.7 million hard drives at an average selling price of $61. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 28.5%, and operating expenses totaled $542 million.", "Non-GAAP tax expense for the December quarter was $21 million, or 5% of non-GAAP pre-tax income. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $374 million, or $1.60 per share. In the December quarter, we generated $598 million in cash from operations, and our free cash flow totaled $449 million. Our CapEx totaled $149 million, or 4% of revenue. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $5.4 billion, of which approximately $500 million was held in the U.S.", "I will now provide an update regarding the cost savings we expect to realize as a result of the integration of our WD and HGST subsidiaries. All of my references in the following commentary are based on calendar years. To remind everyone, we previously indicated that we would realize $400 million of operating expense savings. We also said we would achieve additional meaningful savings from reductions in cost of goods sold. Finally, we indicated the savings will be attained over a one-year to two years period. There are three main components in realizing these savings, including asset and footprint reduction, product roadmap consolidation and organization rationalization.", "During our last earnings call, we also mentioned that the quarterly baseline for operating expenses is $570 million, from which these cost savings should be calculated. Following our initial integration planning, we continue to expect to realize $400 million of operating expense reduction per year on the run rate basis by the end of 2017.", "For cost of goods sold, we expect to realize $250 million of synergy per year on the run rate basis by the end of 2017. This would give us the opportunity to consistently operate in the top half of our existing gross margin model of 27% to 32%. We expect to achieve 50% of the synergy run rate by the end of 2016, and the balance by the end of 2017. We currently estimate cash costs to achieve these savings to be approximately $800 million. This estimate will continue to be refined as we finalize our cost reduction efforts. Finally, we expect about 75% of these costs to be incurred in 2016, and the balance in 2017.", "Moving onto our guidance for the March quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect gross margin percentage to be up from our December quarter, operating expenses of approximately $500 million. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.20 and $1.30.", "Operator, we're now ready to open the call for questions.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Operator, before we get to questions, I just wanted to correct, I had a misreading of my script. The strategic joint venture with Unisplendour will sell our storage systems in China. I believe I misread that as Japan. So I just want to clarify that.", "We'll take people's questions now. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question here comes from Jayson Noland with Robert W. Baird. Your line's now open.", "Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you, and appreciate the detail, Steve and Olivier, on the cost-cutting. I wanted to ask, on the timing, 50% in 2016 and 50% in 2017, how does that roll out through the year, Olivier?", "Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "It will be equally stepping up. I think it's fair to expect that by the end of calendar year 2016. OpEx should be around $520 million, and at the end of calendar year 2017, about $470 million.", "Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then a follow-up on exabytes shipped. Some softness at the end of the year. Do you have much visibility? And what should we expect for the year from a seasonality perspective? Thank you.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Let me take that question. So I think relative to exabytes shipped, particularly in capacity enterprise, we did see it come in a little bit beneath our estimate of 35% growth year-on-year, came in around 32%. We would expect we would normalize back towards 35% this year. We do have some visibility in terms of capital investments of our large customers. We'd expect the seasonality to move back towards something more typical where we would see something in the range of 55% to 60% in the second half of the calendar year, the balance in the first half.", "Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. The line is now open.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group", "Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Steve, I think everybody wants to hear what you have to say about \u2013 in case the Unis deal doesn't happen. In other words, if CFIUS approval is not obtained by the end of February, then the SanDisk acquisition requires the Western Digital shareholder approval and given the fact you seem comfortable that SanDisk is going to close in the June quarter, what gives you confidence that your shareholders are going to approve this?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So there's kind of several questions in there. Let me clarify a couple of things. The first thing is that the closing of the SanDisk acquisition is not contingent upon the closing of the Unis transaction. What will be affected, if for one reason or another, the Unis transaction were not to close, would be that incremental shares would be issued to the SanDisk shareholders in that sort of a scenario. Under either event, we will be seeking shareholder vote on the transaction and the only question is will the number of shares exceed 20% of our outstanding shares. And so there is a scenario where we would seek a shareholder vote, but it may not require the issuance of 20% of our shareholders. But either way, we will be conducting a proxy solicitation on behalf of our shareholders.", "Regarding our confidence level in terms of shareholder \u2013 our strong belief is and very strong belief and strong conviction is that this is the appropriate move for us to make for long-term shareholder value creation and we're confident in our ability to be able to get the necessary approvals from our shareholders to proceed with the transaction.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group", "Great. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up. Your December quarter had enterprise SSD revenue of $270 million, up 44% year-over-year. How should we think about that trending into calendar year 2016?", "Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah. So I think we noted in our comments there'll be some dynamics happening in the first part of the year where we'd expect a pause in that growth. And that's due to two factors. One is, would be typical IT spending being on a more cyclical basis or a seasonal basis. And we do see additional competition in that space, which we would expect to have a effect on our trajectory.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That being said, one of the things that we've said consistently is that we believe with our product portfolio and execution, we have the opportunity to continue to grow our enterprise SSD revenue at a multiple of the market growth, and we continue to believe that that will be the case moving forward.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group", "Would you elaborate on the market growth?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I believe \u2013 what's the longer-term CAGR been estimated at?", "Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "We have been assuming about 25% to 30% CAGR over the next five years, and that's a revenue statement.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group", "Great. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.", "Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Good afternoon. Which segments are driving the below seasonal decline in the TAM in March? And then I have a follow-up.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So it's primarily PC and gaming being the biggest impact to that effect.", "Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "And then you mentioned some visibility in the CapEx plans of large customers. I imagine you're commenting about cloud. Facebook gave aggressive guidance last night, so that makes sense. Would you expect WD's outside share of those large purchases among the cloud service providers to remain? And do you even think that you could grow your share of those purchases this year?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. We think our value proposition to these customers with our product portfolio as well as the services we wrap around them allow us to maintain our share position over time. Obviously, we have continued to execute well as we move forward, as we ramp to 10 terabyte product, et cetera. But we don't see anything that would particularly affect our aggregate share. Over time, we do expect some normalizing of the capacity point share.", "Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from Rich Kugele from Needham & Company.", "Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen. A couple questions. First, we get a lot of inbound questions about interest rates relative to the deal. Can you just talk a little bit about relative to your original expectations to fund the SanDisk transaction now and your ability to go and pay that debt level as the acquisition closes?", "And then, secondly, in terms of the overall TAM, Mike, would you believe that the TAM hits a trough here in the March quarter? Or do you think that there's potential further weakness in the June quarter? Thank you.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, Rich, this is Steve, let me address the first part of that question. One of the things I think that is important to emphasize is that when we evaluated the merits of doing the SanDisk transaction, there's a number of things that we looked at. One is that we did \u2013 we looked at various different scenarios from a business performance level. And we expected and anticipated that there could be some increased volatility from a market perspective, both from a macro perspective as well as volatility as it relates to supply/demand dynamics in the NAND market. So we had stress cases, we have base case scenarios, we also had bull case scenarios. And in all those scenarios, the transaction proved to be value-creating for our shareholders longer term. So we're very confident in that regard.", "Additionally, as we approached the end of the year, we all know that we were looking at the potential for an increasing rate environment here in the U.S. So we factored in some expectation of rate increases in terms of that portion of our financing that would be affected by rate increases. And again, those rate increases today have been within our expectations and we're confident that that will remain the case.", "Additionally, the other thing that we've talked about is \u2013 and there's additional detail to some degree in our S4 filing, is that we expect to quickly deleverage our debt to the tune of specifically $3 billion within a short period of time after the closing of the transaction. That deleveraging will incur in those areas of the market where we are more exposed to interest rate exposure. And so for those various reasons, I would emphasize that we continue to be very confident with regards to our ability to service the debt post close of the SanDisk transaction. So I'll ask Mike to comment on the TAM.", "Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Sure. Yeah, so to answer your question, Rich, I think we would see this as the low point of the year. I'll give you a little additional color on it. Of the sequential decline that we're projecting, we would chalk up roughly two-thirds of that to typical seasonality as well as the secular changes in the market, the balance of that attributed to macro conditions. And I think we would also say that given the environment around us, we're seeing a normal planning bias from the markets to be more conservative around build expectations as well as around inventory position, and all that's factored into our outlook.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "The other thing, Rich, that I'd like to add to that is that we think that barring there being some other macroeconomic event that none of us can predict, that it appears that the calendar first quarter will be the low point from a TAM perspective as it relates to calendar 2016.", "Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC", "Excellent. Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is now open.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah, thanks for taking the questions. I want to go to the reported results. I think this quarter revenue was at the low end of your expectation, but gross margin, I think, you had initially guided to be up a little bit sequentially. So I'm curious of what the underlying drivers were to the relative shortfall in the gross margin line, and I do have a follow-up.", "Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So the relative shortfall in margin was due to two factors. One was product mix, which was the majority of the shortfall, and the balance was lower volume impacting our absorption cost.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. And, Aaron, the mix comment is really due to slightly lower enterprise volumes.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then sticking on the gross margin line as a follow-up, as you look at driving the synergy expectations that you expect of $250 million a year, and we look out to calendar 2017, relative to the mix change happening in the overall hard disk drive industry, should we not be thinking that the gross margin line is at the high end of the 27% to 32%? And if not, why not?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I'm not so sure I would go to that point at this stage, and there's a lot of moving parts in terms of what happens with gross margin. The one thing that \u2013 the biggest drag in terms of near-term on our gross margins, if you want to call it that, I mean, let's be honest, we still continue to have strong gross margin performance, but it's been weaker enterprise volumes. And it really has to do with what Mike was talking about in that the first half of calendar year 2015 had a higher mix of enterprise volumes and then there was an absorption of that \u2013 those drives in the back half. We will see that kind of flip and go to normal seasonality in calendar year 2016.", "So all things remaining equal, we should see our margins begin to benefit from that higher gross margin level as we exit calendar year 2016. But, of course, there can be other factors including pricing which can impact things, there can be total volumes. And so I don't know if I want to be specific at this point as to when we'll end up closer to that high end of that range. But we're certainly going to do everything in our power to make it happen from an execution and from a product perspective.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Yeah, thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I have two questions as well. One, appreciate all the color on the MOFCOM centric savings that you guys are providing. I'm curious, how do you think about cash conversion cycle and CapEx numbers trending, given the fact that you're able to integrate these assets? And what's the right way to think of those factors?", "Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So on the cash conversion cycle, we expect the impact to be minimum. We are going to have some impact on inventory, for example, but we wouldn't factor a (31:37) major improvement. In CapEx, being at the low end of our range, even in the range of 4% is not a bad assumption.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Perfect. And then, I guess, if I just follow up on some of the discussions before, Steve, what's the comfort level you have today to the best you can talk about that the Unis investment comes in the way it was initially structured and doesn't really change? And I want to clarify, you guys are going to seek a shareholder vote on the SanDisk transaction even if you don't need it, i.e., even if you don't have to issue 20% equity, right?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes, that's correct. We will be seeking shareholder vote in any scenario. Yes, you're correct. Regarding our confidence level in terms of CFIUS ruling this to be a non-covered transaction, let me make a couple of comments on that. First thing is, which we've said repeatedly, is that we were very careful with regards to how we structured the transaction. And based upon that, we do not believe it's a covered transaction. Now, that being said, this is up to the CFIUS committee and the U.S. government to decide. And, frankly, that's very difficult at this stage to handicap. So I'm not sure that I want to go there in terms of trying to predict that. We want to certainly respect the decision-making process that the government goes through. We'll continue to engage with them and work with them. But clearly, we were very careful with how we structured the transaction.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Perfect. Thank you and best luck, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Monika Garg with Pacific Crest.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Olivier, could you maybe help us provide more financing detail for the debt you're planning to raise, especially given that SanDisk pays 31% \u2013 32% tax rate, any tax savings synergies from tax if you could share with us? Thanks.", "Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So we believe and we have \u2013 we believe we can optimize the tax structure of SanDisk. We haven't provided much more details than that. And on the debt, if you want to look at the details of the debt, I will refer to our S4 filing, which has all the details of the debt, including the various instruments we'd be using, Monika.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities", "All right, thanks. Then, Steve, maybe could you talk about when do you plan to start using SanDisk NAND in your enterprise SSDs so you could see the margin benefit?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, the short answer is as soon as we can, as soon as we possibly can, but obviously we've got to close the transaction and begin more formally the integration process, et cetera, et cetera so that \u2013 we don't have a specific time on that. But clearly, from a financial and from a product perspective, we're highly motivated to make that happen as quickly as we can from a product development and lifecycle perspective.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities", "Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Rob Cihra with Sterne Agee CRT.", "Rob Cihra - Sterne Agee CRT", "Hi. Thanks very much. On cost cutting, I'm curious if I could ask two questions if I'm allowed. One is just on the guide for the gross margin in the March quarter being up sequentially. Is that already because you're starting to actually get HGST COGS savings? In other words, would it have otherwise been probably down as would normally be the case?", "Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So it would be a mix of both, better mix, slightly, but also starting to realize some of the synergies.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Small amount, Rob.", "Rob Cihra - Sterne Agee CRT", "Yeah, okay. So actually there is some mix benefit there, I guess. And then second question I guess is just with \u2013 I appreciate that the $400 million in OpEx cuts you guys have been talking about all along, so that makes sense. But frankly, if you look at the TAM now, it's structurally lower than it was a year or so ago. So would it not actually be fair to think that something beyond the $400 million would actually make really more sense at this stage? Or is it just the fact you'd rather leave that as a separate \u2013 that's like a separate item, your HGST overlapping and you've got something else? Thanks.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Well, Rob, it's an interesting question because you're right, the $400 million we've been talking about for frankly three-and-a-half years, four years, if my memory is correct. But one thing that I would comment on is that subsequent to that period, as individual entities, there have been a number of OpEx reduction efforts that have occurred since that time. And so the actual reduction in our operating expenses from the close of the HGST, WD transaction is actually much greater than an annual run rate of $400 million. For example, if you remember, the WD sub was engaged in the performance enterprise market. We have exited \u2013 on the WD side, that business was exited, the OpEx savings were saved there. And so net, kind of apples-to-apples, we've actually reduced our OpEx more than that original $400 million that we talked about three-and-a-half years ago.", "Robert Blair - Investor Relations, Founder and Co-Principal", "Next question please.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Stan Kovler with Citi Research.", "Stan Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you. I'm with Citi. As far as the cost savings goes, I was wondering if you could elaborate on cost savings beyond the HGST savings. At what point does the TAM get low enough where you would consider core capacity reductions to some degree? My first question. I have a follow-up.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. That's a fair question. We constantly look at that, constantly look at that. And again, kind of going back to the comment that I made to Rob Cihra's question is that we have been \u2013 as the TAM has come down over the last few years, we have been continuing to rationalize our business to a lower volume base. So it's something that we dynamically and consistently evaluate and we'll continue to do so as we move forward.", "Stan Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks. And just on the transaction, if I could. What's your sense of the Unis investment going through, if in the case that CFIUS does deem it a covered transaction, could that still be something that they're interested in to go through that process and continue with their investment? And on the flipside, if they do wind up backing out for some reason or other considerations, is it possible to restructure the deal at this point to include more debt to lower the dilution in that second scenario of getting shareholder approval and buying SanDisk before the Unis transaction closes? Thank you.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Again, fair question. I'm not going to go there. At this point, our priority is working to satisfy the closing conditions as it relates to the Unis investment, including getting through the CFIUS process. To speculate at this point as to what happens if the U.S. government considers it to be a covered transaction, it's a little bit early to do that. So I'm not going to dare do that at this point.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rod Hall, JPMorgan.", "Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess my first question is regarding visibility. I wonder if you could just remind us what the lead times look like right now for drives. And what gives you confidence that you have visibility beyond March, given the market seems so unpredictable at this stage? And then I've got a follow-up.", "Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer", "So relative to the visibility of demand, we have some improving insight, actually, as these businesses mature to plans for data center build outs and what's going to be required to do that, and what our proportion of that might be. So we continue to refine our engagement with those customers such that we get a more insightful view into it.", "Relative to our drive lead times, it depends on the type of drive that we're talking about. Anywhere from sort of four weeks to eight weeks would be a good planning number, larger capacity being a bit longer and that's due to test time.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. And suffice it to say that given kind of the market volatility that we've seen, the anxiousness that's been out there, we are clearly taking a \u2013 as well as our customers are taking a very cautious view with regards to the demand outlook, particularly here in the near-term. We believe that's the prudent thing to do. But as always in terms of the way that we manage our business, if demand happens to be higher than what we would expect, we'll be there to meet that opportunity.", "Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then my follow-up was just \u2013 I don't know if you guys are able to estimate this, but do you have any idea where inventory levels stand on the consumer side right now, in weeks or some sort of a duration sort of an estimate? And I guess, on enterprise, the same question, although I suppose that's much harder to estimate.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, we don't necessarily have any specific data on that other than to indicate we think that inventory levels are pretty healthy. And what I mean by healthy is relatively lean and in pretty good shape. In other words, we don't think that there is any, call it, excess inventory. We had seen that through calendar year 2015, particularly with some of the \u2013 in the PC market. We believe that that's worked its way through the system. And so in that regard \u2013 I mean, this is a positive statement. We don't believe that there's an inventory overhang that we or the broader industry need to deal with.", "Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "I guess I was thinking on the other side of it, it seems like inventory ought to be getting very lean out there. And I just wondered how stretched is the inventory level?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I don't have a good sense for that. I mean, I don't think we have a call on that right now. So I hope you're right, I'll put it that way.", "Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yeah. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe Wittine with Longbow Research.", "Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC", "Hi. Thanks. Steve, there's talk of Toshiba potentially exiting hard drives. Not to ask you to directly comment on the rumor mill, but instead if it did take place, curious on your view at what would happen to those assets from an industry point of view.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That I'm not going to speculate on. I mean, I don't really know. I don't know what Toshiba's plans are. I mean, that's obviously a question for them and what would they do, would they sell them? I don't know. That's not a question that I'm going to speculate on.", "Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC", "All right, fair enough. Maybe as a quick follow-up, could you just clarify on the enterprise SSD commentary? Growth will pause, did you actually expect to decline year-over-year? That seems a little aggressive just based on a product transition. And along with that, when \u2013 do you expect to show that 25% to 30% growth for calendar 2016 still?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So I mean if you look at, we had $270 million of revenue last quarter. I believe a year ago we had about $230 million of revenue. So we've got a tough compare. Obviously, we're still in the midst of the quarter, but it's possible that we might see our year-on-year revenue down a bit, going into calendar Q1. And as far as the fiscal year, we would prefer not to be short-term focused in terms of that. But it's really, when we talk about exceeding industry growth rates, it's over a longer period of time. It's a little bit too early to say whether or not our growth this year will accelerate or decelerate versus that. So it's not really an indication one way or the other, but I'd prefer not to comment on that specifically.", "Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Miller with Benchmark.", "Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC", "Just looking at your enterprise sales from the first two quarters of this fiscal year, they're significantly below what they were a year ago. In fact, your sales this quarter I think were the lowest since first quarter of fiscal 2013. Just wondering, with the anticipated growth of the cloud, that's somewhat surprising to me. And how much of this is macro? And is there anything else going on with that number?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, Mark, just to clarify, you must be looking at units, right?", "Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC", "Yes.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So I think one of the things that we need to continue to focus on is the petabyte growth as opposed to the unit growth. Obviously, as we ship higher capacity points, we're going to ship, all things remaining equal, fewer units. So as Mike indicated, we continue to see strong petabyte growth. The number that we're estimating is 32% which is \u2013 well, longer term, 35%. This past year for us was 32%, which is pretty consistent with our expectation.", "Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC", "And just final, if you could just explain, in terms of the conversion, whether Unis goes through, I think if Unis doesn't go through it's like 0.24 shares of Western Digital for each SanDisk share. Is the price set on that? Or would you have to give more shares because the price has come down?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "The exchange ratio and the price has been fixed.", "Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC", "And are you at liberty to say what the price \u2013 the fixed price is?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I believe it was $79.50.", "Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Yes. Thanks very much for taking the questions. The first question is on your prepared remarks, Steve, you mentioned a combination of both cyclical and secular factors were causing the weaker outlook. Can you talk more on some of the secular changes that you're seeing and to what extent any secular pressure from flash versus hard drive has accelerated? And in particular I'd be interested in any changes you're seeing in the enterprise segment.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So let me take client first. We see that continuing trend toward client SSDs, particularly in commercial class notebooks. It still remains within our planning guideline. So we don't see it accelerating beyond our expectation, but it is steadily increasing and it's certainly factored into that outlook.", "Relative to the enterprise, we do see, as evidenced by our own SAS enterprise SSD strategy, we do see the beginnings of the incursion of enterprise SSD into what is traditionally performance enterprise. And a way to think about that is it starts at the top first with 15,000 RPM drives as being the first area for that conversion to begin, and then later on it will be others. But we do see incursion in both those segments, all of which is happening within the rate of \u2013 that we have planned in our outlook. So that would be the color I can give you.", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. That's helpful. And then a clarification question on some of the prior SanDisk comments. I know you said you used a range of planning assumptions, but clearly there's a lot of NAND market weakness and also interest rates and other factors. Is the comment that you made on the last \u2013 or on the SanDisk call about 10% accretion, is that still the right number for us to be thinking about, or has that changed?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "It's still the correct number.", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital.", "Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC", "Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Appreciate it. Just two if I could. One is \u2013 the first one is, one of the most frequent questions that we've gotten over the last few months with regards to the SanDisk deal is around Toshiba's ability, or I guess sort of Toshiba's positioning currently on 3D NAND IP development. So, Steve, was just wondering if you could remind us, in that regard, of the due diligence that you guys did in leading up to the announcement of the deal, and your comfort in that regard, with regards to 3D NAND. That would be awesome. And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. So just to remind everybody, as part of our due diligence, as it relates to the SanDisk acquisition is that we did extensive technical due diligence related to where SanDisk/Toshiba was with regards to the 3D NAND transition. That, we were very comfortable with where they were at and continue to be very comfortable with where they're at with their transition, and are particularly encouraged by the recent announcements that they made in conjunction with their earnings announcement, which indicates that they are now commercially shipping their 48 layer 3D NAND product into the marketplace.", "Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC", "Thanks. And then I guess my follow-up is, commensurate with your TAM comments with September \u2013 I'm sorry, March, being the calendar year low, could you share with us what your PC view is this year? And to what extent, if any, we may be able to see some enterprise refresh or commercial refresh as we get to the second half of this year? Thanks.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So relative to \u2013 I'll let Mike address the enterprise refresh. But in terms of PCs, we have not been bullish on the PC market for a while. And we would see, generally speaking, the rate of decline in the PC market to be a bit less than what it's been this past calendar year. And maybe something in 6%, 5%, something like that kind of range on a full-year basis. But as I indicated, we continue to be not particularly optimistic from an overall perspective regarding what's happening in the PC market, and our financial plans and future plans are not highly contingent on that. Mike? Enterprise outlook?", "Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah. So I think on an enterprise outlook basis, I sort of referenced it, on the capacity enterprise segment, we see that continuing to progress. We see an increasing adoption of Helium flash drives as the people deploying infrastructure realize the benefits of the TCO that that technology offers. We articulated that growth rate we would expect across that total segment.", "Relative to the performance category, I just talked a little bit about that. We do see the continuing penetration of flash-based products into that marketplace. We see that continuing through the balance of the year, as evidenced by a number of people in their systems announcements most recently. We would expect that to benefit from that obviously with our strategy of being media agnostic as we move forward with the completion of the SanDisk acquisition.", "Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC", "Thanks a lot. Very helpful.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you for joining us today. In summary, we continue to execute well in a challenging environment and we're taking proactive steps to maintain and extend our cost leadership in the HDD industry. We're also pleased with our progress on our strategic efforts to diversify and strengthen the company for the long term, including the acquisition of SanDisk. We look forward to keeping you informed of our progress on all fronts. Thank you for joining us.", "Operator", "That concludes today's conference call.

Welcome to Western Digital's Financial Results for the Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2016. Presently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.

Western Digital filed the Form S-4 registration statement with the SEC which was declared effective by the SEC on February 5, 2016 and Western Digital filed the definitive proxy statement/prospectus on February 5, 2016, which was mailed to Western Digital and SanDisk stockholders on or about that day.", "Investors and shareholders should read the joint proxy statement/prospectus carefully, because it contains important information about the acquisition. Further, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures.

I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the IR section of our website following the conclusion of this call.", "And I'll now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer, Steve Milligan.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me today are Mike Cordano, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Olivier Leonetti, our Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Olivier will give additional commentary on our March quarter performance and our outlook for the June quarter. He will also provide an update on savings associated with the integration of our HGST and WD subsidiaries.", "I am pleased to report that our plan to close the SanDisk acquisition in the June quarter is on track, having received shareholder approval in March, and having obtained the committed debt financing associated with the transaction earlier this month. We continue to work constructively with China's Ministry of Commerce on its review of the acquisition, the last remaining regulatory approval required to close the SanDisk acquisition.", "Subject to gaining MOFCOM approval and closing the acquisition shortly thereafter, we plan to provide the investment community with an update to the standalone guidance we're providing today, to reflect the partial period of ownership of the SanDisk business in the June quarter.", "Aggregate demand for hard drives in the March quarter was generally consistent with our expectations. We anticipate that hard drive demand in the June quarter will be slightly down from the March quarter, given continued softer PC demand and weaker than expected demand in performance enterprise.", "We believe we have the ability to increase our gross margins sequentially in the June quarter, by continuing to take costs out of the business through our ongoing and unique integration activities of the HGST and WD subsidiaries and through our focus on optimizing our market position and product portfolio mix.", "We continue to manage our business effectively in a dynamic storage demand environment. Computer usage continues to shift from PCs to mobile devices, storage technologies and PCs continue to evolve and enterprise workloads are moving increasingly to cloud-based architectures.", "It's worth noting that as companies evaluate the shift to cloud computing, they are carefully managing their IT spending, affecting both client and enterprise-related purchases in the near term. In the meantime, the creation of data and the amount of it being stored continues to grow, underpinning a promising long-term growth opportunity in the storage industry. Our strategy to become a broad-based provider of media-agnostic storage solutions anticipates these and other trends.", "After we complete the acquisition of SanDisk, we will be better positioned to address and capitalize on these changes and opportunities with the industry's broadest set of storage solutions, a rich technology portfolio and an experienced team in both rotating magnetic and non-volatile memory.", "Olivier will now provide details on our third quarter performance and outlook for the June quarter. Olivier?", "Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Steve. Our revenue for the March quarter was $2.8 billion. We shipped a total of 43.1 million hard drives at an average selling price of $60. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 28.1% and operating expenses totaled $477 million.", "Non-GAAP tax (6:43) expense for the March quarter was $26 million, or 8% of non-GAAP pre-tax income. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $283 million or $1.21 per share. In the March quarter, we generated $485 million in cash from operations, and our free cash flow totaled $352 million. Our CapEx totaled $133 million or 5% of revenue. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $5.9 billion, of which approximately $400 million was held in the U.S.", "I will now provide an update on cost savings initiatives as a result of the integration of our WD and HGST subsidiaries. This information is also provided in our quarterly factsheet posted on our website. All my references in the following commentary are based on calendar years. As a reminder, we provided our initial estimates of the savings on our last earnings conference call in late January.", "Based on our ongoing integration activity, we are revising our associated savings and cost estimates. We now expect to achieve total savings of $800 million on an annualized run rate basis by the end of 2017 versus the $650 million estimated previously. Specifically, savings from operating expenses are now expected to be $450 million on an annualized run rate basis, of which two-third will occur by the end of 2016 and the balance by the end of 2017.", "This would result in a new OpEx run rate of $460 million per quarter exiting 2017. This compares with our earlier estimate of $400 million OpEx savings with 50/50 split between the two years and a run rate of $470 million per quarter exiting 2017.", "For cost of goods sold, we now expect to achieve $350 million of savings on an annualized run rate basis, of which 50% will occur by the end of 2016 and the balance by the end of 2017. This compares with our earlier estimate of $250 million of annualized run rate savings by the end of 2017 with a 50/50 split between the two years. As a reminder, these savings would provide us with the opportunity to consistently operate in the top half of our existing gross margin model of 27% to 32%.", "We continue to estimate cash expense to achieve these sayings to be approximately $800 million. We now expect 60% of these expenses to be incurred in 2016 and the balance in 2017. This timing compares with our earlier estimate of 75% being incurred in 2016 and the balance in 2017.", "Moving on to our guidance for the June quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect gross margin percentage to be up from our March quarter, operating expenses of approximately $475 million. Excluding the impact due to the interest expense from debt financing related to the SanDisk acquisition, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.00 and $1.10. As Steve mentioned, we look forward to providing you with an update of today's standalone guidance to reflect the anticipated partial period of ownership of SanDisk in the June quarter.", "Operator, we're now ready to open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's call. One moment please for the first question. Our first question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi, Olivier. I wanted to clarify on your OpEx savings. I think you said OpEx would now be at a run rate of $460 million. Is that what you said going forward after these savings from MOFCOM? And then, just thinking about the savings, where are these coming from? Why do you think you're able to get so much more savings from the synergies between Western Digital and Hitachi? Thanks.", "Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So the saving to be achieved after two years will reach an amount of $450 million. That's an annual number. To help you in your modeling, we will expect, as a result, at the end of calendar year 2016 quarterly OpEx of being $495 million and at the end of 2017, an amount in Q4 of $460 million.", "Those savings come from a range of activities ranging from rationalization in R&D, in G&A mainly for OpEx.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sherri, we're basically eliminating redundancies where we've got redundant functions between the two entities. And also just why has the number changed? Obviously, when a large part of the hold separate was lifted, we had estimates of what those savings would look like. And as we progress through the integration process, we're able to refine those estimates and have more specific numbers to provide not only for ourselves, but for the investment community.", "Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And then just clarifying on the debt, when do you close the debt to buy SanDisk and how should we think about that as an interest rate, because it looks like it's impacting EPS a little bit more than I would have thought? So it seems like you'll close that before the deal happens. Thanks.", "Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So all the financing is complete. So the $18.1 billion we needed to raise has been raised and it's either committed by banks or sold to investors. So we expect to come back to you with all the details associated with the interest and time of reimbursement and so on, as we close the transaction which will be, as we said, during Steve prepared remarks in the June quarter.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. And Sherri, just to clarify, the EPS estimate that we provided does not include the impact of interest expense associated with the acquisition.", "Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So when we give updated financial views, we didn't want to do, I'll call it a half a loaf, right? So when we closed the transaction or shortly thereafter, we will provide an updated view for the sub period for our fiscal Q4, which will include the impact of SanDisk's business on us, any purchase accounting impacts and interest expense. So it will be a full-on view for calendar Q2.", "Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "One additional comment on the debt, obviously, the cost of the debt for secured bond and unsecured bond is public. But we wanted to say that the average rate for the total debt will be significantly lower than the rate of the bonds and will come back to you in short order.", "Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thank you. That clarifies. Thank you very much.", "Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.", "Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Good afternoon. A few questions. If you could just talk first, Steve, you did start to touch on the weakness in PCs and enterprise, but if you could just elaborate on both the demand and pricing trends by category and then I have a follow-up.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. I'll comment on it, and then, Mike Cordano may want to add a little bit as well as we go through. From a demand perspective, as I indicated, from an aggregate demand perspective, things came in pretty much the way that we had expected, right? We had called 100 million unit TAM and came in at whatever, 99.8, that's our estimate, right? We haven't seen Toshiba's numbers yet.", "And within that, I would say that the PC market, obviously, remains weak and a bit weaker than what we expected. Now, that being said, I'm going to sound like I'm contradicting myself, we had hedged that a little bit, because we've been pretty bearish on the PC market for a while. But clearly, the PC market remains a bit weaker than what we expected.", "I would say that from a demand perspective, the area of, if you want to call it, biggest surprise was that performance enterprise was weaker than we expected. Mike can comment a little bit on what we're seeing there, after I kind of give a view on what we saw from a pricing perspective. And then, there were some other areas that were maybe kind of slightly better than what we expected where, in aggregate, it came out to kind of 100 million unit TAM number.", "Now, from a pricing perspective, kind of a mixed bag there. On the positive side, we were able to increase our pricing in the 2.5-inch market, both oriented towards notebook as well as in gaming. So we were able to increase our prices and those price increases have stuck and are reflected in our go forward estimates as it relates to our financials.", "On the negative side is that we saw steeper than anticipated price declines in the enterprise market, both in performance enterprise and, even more specifically, in capacity enterprise. And to be even more specific on that, in the 4 terabyte, 8 terabyte capacity points. And you can see that if you look at our margins where they were short of our expectations, and we were down quarter-on-quarter, that is directly correlated to what we saw from a pricing perspective. And oh, by the way, further to that, we actually lost share in the enterprise market as we chose not to participate in some of those more steeper declines from a pricing perspective.", "Now, what we're doing as a consequence of that is that we're taking the action from our standpoint, because we want to make sure that we've got sufficient dollars to reinvest back into our business to continue to innovate and provide compelling products for our customers, we are making selective price increases in certain enterprise markets. And at this point, we're not sure if they're going to stick, but we're certainly hoping that they do.", "And with that, I'll ask Mike to comment a bit on performance enterprise demand dynamics.", "Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah. Hi, Rich. So I think it's important to start delineating the performance enterprise marketplace. And if you think about it as those performance enterprise drives that sell into the storage system marketplaces versus the server marketplace, what we have seen for some time is a decline in 15,000 RPM that continues \u2013 that trend down continues. We are now seeing some more trending down happening in the 10,000 RPM market quarter-over-quarter.", "But the pronounced reduction we see is really in the storage segment of the marketplace. I think that's reflected in what we see people doing with all-flash arrays and whatnot. So going forward, we think we'll see accelerating trends, downward trends within the storage segment, but a more stable profile within the server segment and we'll be, as Steve said, looking at the way that portfolio shapes up and positioning ourselves appropriately.", "Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC", "Okay, that's helpful. And then lastly, Olivier, I know it's early, but in light of recent actions by the Treasury Department on, initially I guess tax inversions, but it could potentially have broader impacts on broad cross-border transfers and other things. Do you see any impact at this point on the way you wanted to normalize the tax rate between the two companies over time?", "Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So, Rich, obviously this recent action is a draft which is currently being open for comments. And while it's premature for us to provide more details at this stage, we feel comfortable with the structure of our transactions. So no change at this stage, Rich.", "Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is now open.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah, thank you. A couple questions also, if I can. First of all, as we look at the capacity shipment growth for the industry, it's continued to be relatively slow. I was curious if you could help us understand or delineate between what you've seen capacity shipment growth-wise in the PC market as well as CE. And then, relative to the overall enterprise market. And then in the context of the pricing environment, I'm curious of how you would frame the discussion around the gross margin differential between those segments.", "Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Okay. Let me touch on that capacity growth. So we continue to see, again, looking on an annualized basis, considering the calendar year, capacity enterprise continues to trend at this 35% run rate. Last year looks like, and the data is preliminary, that it came in around 34%. We would expect this year also to be tracking to that number, maybe slightly greater. We'll see how the year pans out.", "Now, the one thing I should point out, we discussed this last time, is carrier 2015 was inverted relative to seasonality, stronger in the first half, weaker in the second half. This year is more traditional seasonality where we expect strength in the back end of the year. And that's further supported by what a number of the hyperscale companies have talked about relative to expected CapEx. So that growth remains as expected. The softness in capacity shipments really is across the other markets, led by the PC market as well as this new news that we discussed today on performance enterprise.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Any comments on the relative margin differential between the segments?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Aaron, I'm not sure there's any new commentary. Obviously, the higher margin segments for us is in the enterprise area, capacity enterprise and performance. And then all still at attractive margins, the low end of that would be client-related activity as well as in gaming. And so there's really no change in terms of our margin hierarchy that we've talked about previously.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I have a question and a follow-up as well. If you could just start with for the June quarter, you guys I think are looking at the TAM or at least revenues decline by about 6%. Is that entirely going to come from units or is there a pricing dynamic as well? And any segment information you could provide in terms of what's getting incrementally softer in June would be helpful.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, so we would say that TAM, to be more specific, would be about 95 million units for the June quarter. And the primary reason for that is continued weakness in terms of the PC market. And not only that, but, frankly, from our standpoint and as well as our customers, a very cautious view with regards to that market. Not a lot of bullish views out there on the PC market. As well as continued softness in terms of the performance enterprise.", "Those are the only ones that I think are really kind of worthy of calling out. We've got some other puts and takes in terms of normal seasonal trends that we see from a Q1 to Q2. But the primary reason for that decline is really those two factors that I called out.", "The other thing that I would add to that is that if you go back to our prior conference call, we had anticipated that the March quarter would be the low point of the year from a TAM perspective. Obviously, that has not borne itself out assuming that the TAM turns out to be 95 million units. And the primary reason for that is, again, because of weaker PC sales and softer demand for traditional performance enterprise hard drives.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks. And if I just follow-up on the enterprise SSD side, revenues were down I think 11% versus year-over-year. And you guys talked about it being down last quarter somewhat, but it seems a little bit more severe than I would have thought and what some of your peers have been talking about. So I'm just wondering if you could just talk about what's happening within that segment and how do you see that transpire for the rest of the year? Thank you.", "Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah, I think we had talked about a product transition underway. Certainly, we are seeing increased competitiveness there. But for us, we're in the midst of a product transition, which we will get through as we progress through the year. So that largely accounts for the difference you're talking about.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, and by the way, just to give you some insight to that. We had obviously expected and we messaged and telegraphed a decrease in terms of that revenue. And the decrease was more or less consistent with what we expected. And not only that, we we did a little bit better than we thought. So it's not concerning for us. It's something that we expected. And it just has to do with the normal product transition that we're working through on our end with our customers.", "Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Right. And I'll add a little more color. I think relative to strategic engagements, they remain very well intact. And we think we'll get through this in the normal course of things. So no ongoing impact that we expect once we get through the transition.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Perfect. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. Your line is open.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Yes, Steve, it seems like the characterization of your customer and trend and their buying behavior is changing. The traditional enterprises haven't been as active over the past few years and that has been replaced by the cloud guys, and the cloud guys are pushing for more of a array procurement. In that context, do you see the change in your customer characterization having an impact on how you define different segments of the market?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Go ahead, Mike.", "Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah. So I think we absolutely see a transition between our customers, but that's really reflected mostly by moving from platform to traditional client server markets to cloud-based architectures as we talked about in our prepared remarks. So that architectural shift is happening, and with that, the ratio of business is trending towards more of the cloud-based architectures when we talk about enterprise.", "So as we look at the customers, certainly, is that the relative revenue is changing the way we look at them, engage them is also changing and that's all contemplated within our business and our modeling going forward. So yes, to your question, both from a customer transition as well as a \u2013 which architectures are we shipping into and how workloads are migrating.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Which makes it lumpier. And a follow-up has to do with the NAND. Have you already started the product qualification as you go through the integration of SanDisk? And how should we think about the timing associated, because as you go through the qualification for your own \u2013 for the existing SSD products, as well as consolidating enterprise SSDs once SanDisk is integrated, I imagine there would be a time or a lagging effect how you get your arms around it. Is that going to \u2013 do we need to wait till July conference call to get more clarification or how should we think about this timing? Any color you can provide will be appreciated.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, a few comments there. I mean the first thing is, no, we have not begun any qualification or integration-related activities for our products. And I think it's important to note that, obviously, we continue to operate as two separate companies. And so that would be inappropriate for us to be engaging in that kind of activity at this point.", "Now, relative to the timing, let me make a few comments on that. From a financial perspective, when we talked about the financial synergies that we expected to realize, there was some timing that was wrapped around that. There is no change in terms of the expectation as it relates to that timing. So that remains consistent.", "Obviously, we'll update the investment community as we move forward on how that timing may change, et cetera. But there are multiple considerations that we have to think about. Obviously, the most important thing is that we want to execute the transition in a way that makes the most sense for our partners. And so, that's our customers, as well as our relationship with Intel. We've enjoyed a very strong relationship with Intel over a period of time. And we want to make sure that we're doing this in a way that makes the most sense for all the parties involved. So that will take some time, and we do believe that when we talked about the financial synergies that we would realize that we factored in appropriately those time considerations in our thinking.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yes, thank you. I know the acquisition is not closed yet, the SanDisk acquisition, but how are you viewing the relative progress of the 3D NAND roadmap at SanDisk, especially in the context of other industry investments? And what timeframe do you expect the SanDisk acquisition to be accretive given the moving pieces? And I have a follow-up.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, so I'm going to speak to it in general, because we don't have perfect visibility into that, but we continued to be encouraged. I mean, obviously, we did extensive due diligence just to kind of back up on where we believe that SanDisk was at from a 3D NAND transition perspective. And we have monitored their progress, as time has gone on, and as you saw in their earnings release, they continue to make good progress.", "So we're actually very pleased with where they are at on their 3D NAND transition. We're not in a position to be updating our financial view on the transaction. I mean the numbers that we put out there remain intact. And obviously, there are a lot of moving parts. There are a lot of variables that can change, but in general, we continue to believe that the financial assumptions that we have looked at remain solid as it relates to the acquisition of SanDisk.", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, Steve. And as a follow-up, can you talk about the potential to raise prices more broadly across the portfolio? And what impact on the flip side do you think that raising prices could have on the rate of SSD adoption? Did you see some of that already?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I mean the ability to raise prices, that's always a difficult question to answer. I mean what we're trying to do is we're trying to provide value to our customers. And there's a lot of different ways you can provide value to the customers. And we have to have price competitive products, but we also need to make sure that we've got sufficient returns on those products that we're selling that allows us to reinvest in our technology and our products such that those products continue to remain compelling.", "And so, as we indicated, we have taken some efforts and seen price increases stick in the 2.5-inch market. We saw steeper declines in the enterprise market. We chose not to participate in some of those areas. We're now in the process of instituting some selective price increases in the enterprise market. And it's too early to tell at this point to what extent they're going to stick. And so, we'll have to see, because there are other market participants and we're just trying to run on our own plays and see how it all works out.", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. I want to build off of the last question in terms of just trying to understand what have been your assumptions around the kind of the vector, if you will, in terms of HDD versus SSD penetration in terms of how much of PCs, server and storage capacity currently is served by HDD versus SSD, and where does that kind of trend over the next two years, three years, that give you confidence to be, one, pursuing SanDisk, but also, two, to becoming this agnostic media provider.", "Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Mark, I'll have Mike take a stab at that.", "Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer", "You need to think about it differently for each segment. In the case of PC, it's a unit replacement. So you think about a PC, it has \u2013 most often, it has a single storage device, and there's going to be a selection made between a HDD or an SSD.", "So the trends there relative to SSD penetration, we've been tracking them for some time. In the SSD versus PC outlook, we're in the mid-30%s in terms of penetration. That's continuing to track in a way that we've anticipated. So we don't see anything unusual there happening with that, although we do believe the trend will continue.", "Within the enterprise segment, it's a very different dynamic. It's really based on workload and it's based on where cost is driven on a cost per I/O basis. Flash becomes a more attractive option. I talked earlier about where the displacement is happening with performance enterprise. It's primarily in two spots. One is when you put it into an array form, so the traditional storage systems area. And that's where you can get a more efficient cost per I/O across total infrastructure, system infrastructure.", "So it's not really based upon a storage capacity metric. It's based on looking at the workloads, looking at where we need to optimize I/O versus storage. So it's a different set of calculus. It's not a one-for-one replacement either, given these dynamics. So we do see that trend happening in a different way in the storage systems area.", "Moving into servers. It follows something closer to the PC model, where you have low-end and mid-range servers that tend to have a number of storage devices and it tends to be price-point related. So you match the CPU, the memory and the storage performance in a way to deliver a price and value proposition. So that marketplace will more closely follow the way the PC marketplace is going and, frankly, it will go at a slower trajectory. So we don't see the impact in the server marketplace relative to SSD replacement that we see in the storage systems market.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, and I think, Mark, just to add to that, it's a little bit of a financial overlay to it. The trends that we're seeing are consistent with our expectations. And I think that's an important thing.", "But as you know, sometimes the difficult thing is not so much to predict what the trend is going to be, but the rate and pace. And so the rate and pace is kind of difficult to estimate. But what's important relative to what we're doing and it really speaks to the importance of having this integration opportunity as it relates to WD and HGST as well as with the acquisition of SanDisk, is that you have the optionality or the ability to maneuver around the rate and pace issues that sometimes present themselves to, for example, take cost out faster than you need to in legacy businesses and also shift over to newer technologies quicker.", "And so with the changes that we're making and the options that we have, we'll be able to modulate not only those trends, but the rate and pace issue, which is more difficult to predict as we move forward. So we think it's very important to recognize that in terms of our ability to be able to deal with those changes.", "Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah, and one last comment just to append what Steve said. So although the pieces underneath are moving around on us, as we've described, the aggregate spend in enterprise on storage when you combine SSD and HDD continues to grow at a rate that's consistent with our expectation.", "Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. I appreciate that. It sounds like it's a pretty frenetic environment, but it sounds like at this point you will be in a position to optimize the combined company and not have to be playing catch-up relative to some of these dynamics.", "I guess I have just one follow-up though, if I could. Are you seeing anything different in terms of the cloud providers versus the on-premise? Are they acting a little differently with respect to flash versus disk?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No. So, the cloud guys have been on a capacity enterprise plus flash model for some time. They have not been a big consumer of performance enterprise. That really goes to our legacy systems businesses. So that trend continues within the cloud world.", "Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from James Kisner with Jefferies.", "James Kisner - Jefferies LLC", "I just want to clarify your comments on MOFCOM. So there was a news source that was reporting that the NDRC is getting involved and that in the MOFCOM approval process, seen some complaints from suppliers around this deal. And just wondering if you can comment whether there have been complaints and has that slowed the approval process at all and when do you think you might get approval?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, so just as I said, we have a very strong relationship with MOFCOM. We have a very constructive dialogue with them. I'm not going to comment and chase rumors around, but I'm very pleased with the progress that we're making and we expect to close the transaction here in the second quarter. So no issues from that perspective.", "James Kisner - Jefferies LLC", "Okay, thanks. And just as a follow-up. This quarter, I think you spent less on CapEx in absolute terms than you have in a very long time. And just wondering how we should think about the capital intensity of Western Digital's business sort of ex-SanDisk going forward over the next few quarters as well as the next couple of years. Thanks.", "Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Obviously, as we are rationalizing the footprint of our organization that will have an impact on CapEx, obviously, we're looking at maximizing the use of cash. To answer specifically to your question, 4% of revenue going forward is probably \u2013 CapEx is probably a good number to use.", "James Kisner - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital.", "Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC", "Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just two, if I could. The first one, Steve, is just to sort of follow on your comments about rate and pace. How do you guys philosophically think about the interplay in the enterprise between what's going on with flash and then the traditional enterprise portfolio?", "And I know you can't comment sort of probably specifically about the SanDisk product, but just from what attracted you in that regard to their portfolio, just a bigger picture, do you \u2013 if you see the shift may be taking place a little bit more quickly, the enterprise to flash from \u2013 sort of from performance HDD.", "Do you think that there can be a relatively, I guess, smooth transition from a revenue dollar perspective relative to the WD P&L? It seems like it was a \u2013 I think you're implying is a little bit more disruptive this quarter than you thought it might have been. So we'd love to get your thoughts on at least the high or low, how we might think about that interplay as we go forward. And then I had just one quick follow-up. Thanks.", "Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah, let me try to answer that. So I think relative to a post- acquisition close situation, we will be able to participate in all segments of the enterprise SSD marketplace. So once we've accomplished that, the comment I made earlier relative to the growth within enterprise devices, SSD plus HDD being largely as expected, is really the movement within. So we really need the broad portfolio to do that. We are obviously excited to get to the point where we have in that. So we think we have the diverse tools we need to manage that transition.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. And we were \u2013 by the way, I mean we were very pleased with the enterprise SSD numbers that SanDisk posted yesterday. So that's encouraging as well.", "Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC", "That's very helpful context. And then, just quickly, Steve, what are your TAM views for the remainder of the year given that kind of June Q feels a little bit softer than you thought it would be 90 days ago. Thanks.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Well, in that, it's difficult to predict at this point to be honest, because it is \u2013 we got a weak macroeconomic environment. So I don't need to go through all of the reasons why demand is a little bit more suppressed than what we'd hoped. But what we expect to see is a normal seasonal bump in terms of demand in Q3 and Q4. The question is how much. And frankly, I'm going to have to kind of skirt that question, because I think that it's still a little bit too far out to be able to predict that, but we would expect to see some sort of seasonal increase in demand in calendar Q3 and Q4.", "To where we should have a TAM? This is not going to really help you, but we clearly should have a TAM that will be in excess of 400 million units, right?", "Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC", "Got it. Appreciate it. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Roy with UBS. Your line is now open.", "John M. A. Roy - UBS Securities LLC", "Thank you. A real quick question on the gross margin. I mean, I know we've been looking at this a long time. Do you think you're running at a new normal? I know you guided to the top half of your range, but what gives you confidence that the gross margin won't stay down in the lower half given what we see in the last few quarters?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, there's two factors to consider. One is that we have these cost savings that will be realizing as a consequence of the WD HGST integration, which will obviously assist us in improving our gross margins. The other thing is, which Mike talked about is, over the last really three quarters, ourselves and as an industry have been dealing with a bit of a suppressed demand environment in the capacity enterprise market.", "And so, as that works its way back up to a more normalized demand environment, say, starting in the second half of this year which is back on that 35% kind of exabyte consumption model, that will aid us from a gross margin perspective. And then, additionally, as I mentioned earlier, we have taken some actions to selectively increase our prices which we also believe, assuming that they stick, will provide a benefit to our gross margins.", "John M. A. Roy - UBS Securities LLC", "Could you characterize the Hitachi stuff, what's going to \u2013 what do you feel like \u2013 is that most of it or is that half of it or a third? I don't know.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I would prefer not to try to dimension it that way. I think you're just going to have to do your own modeling to try to estimate that.", "John M. A. Roy - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird. Your line is now open.", "Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Thank you. The pressure on performance enterprise seems real versus AFA as discussed on the call. Are we getting close to a point where, in your enterprise segment, you're shipping more capacity enterprise than performance enterprise?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I don't think that we have talked about that, Jayson. So you're going to have to \u2013 I feel like a broken record. You're going to have to do your best to try to guesstimate that on your own.", "Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Fair enough. Just a follow-up on visibility into capacity enterprise. Your language is the same or similar, at least, to last quarter on strength in the second half. Has visibility improved from that segment over the last few months? And is it \u2013 it's more of a second half of the calendar year than it is a June quarter event?", "Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah. So I think we talked earlier that it was going to be a stronger second half of the calendar year last time. I would say our resolution continues to tighten as we get closer, so we have basically confirmation of what we thought last time. So that's been largely echoed in what we hear relative to CapEx plans from some large consumers of these units.", "Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Thank you.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Jayson. Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to keeping you informed of our progress on all fronts.

Welcome to Western Digital's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2016 Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.", "Robert Blair - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thank you, and good afternoon everyone. This conference call will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws including statements concerning our expected financial performance for our first fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2016, our market positioning, expectations regarding our transformation, growth opportunities, near-term priorities, long-term business model, and strategy execution, integration activities and achievement of synergy goals, demand and market trends, our product portfolio, product development efforts, and customer acceptance of our products, data growth and its drivers and our wafer capacity.", "These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q with the SEC on May 9, 2016. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events.", "Further, references will be made during this call to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable historical GAAP financial measures are included in the quarterly fact sheet posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. We have not reconciled our non-GAAP financial measures guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because material items that impact these measures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort.", "I also want to call to your attention the quarterly fact sheet posted on our Investor Relations section of our website has been updated to reflect enhancements to our reporting, including the breakout of revenues and exabytes shipped to three end markets: data center devices and solutions, client devices and client solutions. The definitions of these three end market categories can be found in the quarterly fact sheet.", "In the question-and-answer part of today's call, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question to allow as many callers as possible to ask their questions. Thank you in advance for your cooperation. And with that, I will turn the call over to our CEO, Steve Milligan.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; Olivier Leonetti, Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Long, Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Strategy Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights. Olivier will cover the fiscal fourth quarter financials, and Mark will wrap up with our guidance for the first fiscal quarter.", "Earlier this afternoon, we reported revenue and non-GAAP EPS for our fiscal fourth quarter that were better than the preliminary results announced earlier this month. We are reporting revenue of $3.5 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 31%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.79.", "Fiscal 2016 was a transformative year for our company. We took significant steps to continue our evolution into the leading storage solutions company and to return to growth with global scale and extensive product and technology assets. Given unabated growth in data and the increasing role technology plays in the lives of individuals and organizations large and small, we believe Western Digital is uniquely positioned to address the broadest range of storage opportunities in the", "marketplace.", "We embarked on a journey several years ago with a vision to provide a full spectrum of storage solutions. With the various acquisitions we have made so far, along with organically growing our capabilities, we are much further along today on that mission to help the market determine which solutions work best for a given application. We are a market and customer driven organization, and we believe this strategy will deliver long-term value for our customers, shareholders, and employees.", "With our long-term strategy clear, we are focused on execution. I am pleased to report that our integration activities associated with our acquisitions are going well. We are on target to achieve our synergy goals as a unified entity, focused on addressing the tremendous growth of data and the evolving needs of our customers.", "Additionally, our near-term priorities include our transition to 3D NAND and the deleveraging of our balance sheet. We have achieved several recent milestones associated with these initiatives. We have completed the rationalization and alignment of our product and technology roadmaps involving legacy WD, HGST, and SanDisk products, and we have shared this with our customers. We celebrated the opening of the New Fab 2 wafer manufacturing facility in Japan with Toshiba, underscoring the continued strength of our 16-year partnership.", "We announced our next generation 3D NAND technology, BiCS3, with an industry leading 64 layers of vertical storage capability, pilot production of BiCS3 has commenced, and we expect meaningful commercial volumes in the first half of calendar 2017.", "And we repaid in full the $3 billion bridge loan associated with the financing of the SanDisk acquisition. We also remain focused on innovating and investing in our business to ensure that we continue to remain agile and addressing changing market needs. At this important time in our company's history, I am inspired by the enthusiasm and positive spirit of our employees and the favorable response to our enhanced value proposition by our customers.", "I will now ask Mike Cordano to provide his comments on the business operations.", "Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon everyone. I'd like to echo Steve's excitement on what we have seen in the company in the last 77 days since the close of the SanDisk acquisition. We are excited about the possibilities created by the combination for our customers, employees and shareholders. Western Digital now has a broadened portfolio of solutions for the data center, client device, and client solution markets. We have been combining our HGST and WD subsidiaries since last October in compliance with the Chinese Ministry of Commerce decision.", "Following the close of the SanDisk acquisition on May 12, we have made substantial progress in integrating all of our assets in the new Western Digital. The team has done a phenomenal job in reconciling and aligning the various product roadmaps, a complicated task executed well on a compressed time line. We have identified key leaders for our various functions, and we are rapidly aligning the capabilities and talents of our employees.", "Coupled with a series of restructuring actions, we have taken over the last two years against the backdrop of a declining HDD TAM, we have further streamlined our manufacturing footprint in recent months with the closure of two facilities in Japan and Malaysia and the announced closure of a facility in Singapore. Relative to our legacy Western Digital business, we have reduced our overall facilities footprint by almost one fifth and our head count by almost one quarter over the last two fiscal years.", "Turning to the specifics of our fourth quarter results, in HDDs we achieved overall exabyte growth of 12% on a year on year basis, primarily driven by shipments of our capacity enterprise HDDs to data center customers. Exabyte growth in our capacity enterprise product line was 47% on a year on year basis, faster than the market growth rate thanks to the ongoing success of our Helium platform. We believe this trend will continue in the second half of this calendar year as we ramp our 10 terabyte product to high volume, our third generation helium drive. This product is a key differentiator for the company as it provides us a generational advantage and has already created significant marketplace momentum.", "In enterprise SSDs, we saw strength in sales in both enterprise and cloud customers. From a client devices perspective, we are benefiting from the growing attach rate of SSDs to PCs in both the commercial and consumer categories even as client HDD unit shipments decline year-over-year.", "In our other flash-related businesses, we saw a broad-based strength across several key markets and our operational execution was strong across the board. Our industry leading 15 nanometer technology remained the workhorse and that accounted for the vast majority of our total supply. Manufacturing yields on 15 nanometer technologies set another record and our sustained leadership in 2D NAND has continued to position us well in the key markets we serve.", "Earlier this week, we were pleased to announce our next generation 3D NAND technology called BiCS3. With 64 layers of vertical storage, BiCS3 will primarily feature our three bit per cell, or X3 architecture, delivering the industry's smallest 256 gigabit chip. The combination of X3 and manufacturing innovations will allow us to extend our cost reduction capabilities beyond our 15 nanometer node. Consequently, we have decided to allocate a greater portion of our planned 3D NAND capacity conversion to BiCS3 instead of BiCS2. And this will allow us to rapidly convert to our next generation 3D NAND technology in 2017. Additionally, we expect our 2D NAND technology to have a long tail, as we will continue to utilize it for certain markets.", "From a wafer fab standpoint, in the June quarter, we completed the planned 5% wafer capacity expansion for 2016, and this will provide us slightly more than 3 million wafers of captive output by the end of calendar 2016. Given the planned mix of 2D and 3D NAND technologies, for the rest of the year we expect our bit supply growth to be approximately 30% in calendar 2016, somewhat below our estimate for total industry bit supply growth, as we had previously indicated.", "However, as we look to 2017, the planned rate of conversion of our 2D NAND capacity to BiCS3 will enable a mix of our 3D NAND wafer capacity to approach 40% of the total capacity by the end of 2017. This will place both our mix of 3D NAND capacity and our overall bit growth rate in line with the industry.", "Switching to the near term, we believe the overall demand environment is better than it has been in recent quarters driven by the following, new product cycles in mobile devices and PCs are tailwinds for our client business along with seasonality. Additionally, SSDs are continuing to penetrate further into PCs, even as PC unit volumes shrink. We are seeing a tight supply of NAND as the industry transitions from 2D to 3D NAND technology. And we are experiencing stronger demand in non-SSD flash markets such as mobile, and there is demand pull from hyperscale customers in our cloud-related data center business.", "Offsetting these factors, we have seen share driven price dynamics in certain pockets of the HDD market. These include the low end of the 2.5 inch HDD market and the 8 terabyte capacity point in capacity enterprise. Consequently, we have moderated our participation in those areas. Our fiscal Q4 performance and forwarded guidance for fiscal Q1 takes these variables into account.", "To wrap up my comments, Western Digital is very unique in our industry. A combination of WD, HGST, and SanDisk has allowed us to methodically augment our capabilities to become a truly broad-based storage solutions provider. We look forward to giving you ongoing updates on our business.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier to review our Q4 financial results.", "Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Mike. Our revenue for the June quarter was $3.5 billion. Including the partial payout of SanDisk ownership, our non-GAAP gross margin was 31% and operating expenses totaled $691 million. Interest and other expense for the quarter included $181 million of interest expense related to the debt for the SanDisk acquisition.", "Non-GAAP tax benefit for the June quarter was $24 million due to the impact of interest expense related to the SanDisk acquisition. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $208 million or $0.79 per share. In the June quarter, we generated $355 million in cash from operations and our free cash flow totaled $114 million.", "Our net CapEx totaled $241 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share. We closed the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $8.2 billion, of which approximately $1.3 billion was held in the US. After the close of the June quarter and, as Steve mentioned earlier, we utilized $3 billion to pay off the bridge loan.", "Finally, I would like to thank Steve and the rest of the leadership team at Western Digital, our employees, and the investment community for your partnership and support over the last two years during my tenure as CFO. As I leave Western Digital to pursue other opportunities, I am confident in Mark's leadership to guide the finance and strategy organization and the company through the transformation that we have undertaken. Mark?", "Mark P. Long - Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Strategy Officer", "Thank you, Olivier. It is an exciting time for me to be leading the company in this new role, and I look forward to meeting you in the weeks and months ahead. While I will be new to the CFO role at Western Digital, I have been with the company and in the industry for many years. Before providing our September quarter guidance, let me say a few words about how we are evolving our reporting of the company moving forward.", "With the close of the SanDisk acquisition, we are moving further into the execution phase of our value creation strategy, extending our platform across all segments of the storage landscape. We believe that we have a compelling long-term business model due to our comprehensive product offering and significant exposure to key growth sectors. As a result, we have an industry-leading business with above industry average margins and a balanced cash flow risk profile that leverages our diversified portfolio of storage technologies.", "Today we have begun to evolve our reporting and disclosures in our commentaries and quarterly fact sheet, consistent with our value creation strategy. We will report our business in terms of three primary end markets: one, data center devices and solutions; two, client devices; and three, client solutions. Our quarterly fact sheet describes which specific product and solution types are included in each of these three end markets.", "Within these categories, our reporting will focus on the drivers of value including revenue and exabytes shipped. We will also be providing qualitative gross margin commentary associated with our bit allocation and mix-up strategies for our NAND and HDD products respectively.", "We have discontinued providing the following information in the quarterly fact sheet: revenue from top ten customers, enterprise SSDs, and non-PC applications. We believe these metrics are less relevant today given the diversification of our business. As we continue to evaluate the best way for us to disclose the drivers of our business, we will evolve our reporting in the coming quarters. This may result in the addition or deletion of some of the information provided today.", "In the coming quarters, we will also provide additional commentary on key operating activities, including achievement of our synergy and cost reduction objectives and key technology milestones. We believe these reporting modifications provide the best balance considering an evolving market for value creation drivers and our historical reporting practices. Over the near term, we will continue to make certain legacy disclosures available to allow for a transition between our historical and new reporting. We expect to make a full transition by the end of this fiscal year.", "At our Investor Day on December 6, we will provide a deeper dive into our overall strategy. At that time, we will discuss our long-term strategy and target financial and business model, which should provide further clarity on what we expect to deliver across key financial metrics including gross margin, OpEx, operating margin, CapEx, tax and cash flow for the new Western Digital. Our overall objective as it relates to our disclosures and communication is to provide an appropriate level of transparency while balancing competitive considerations and still allowing for a deep understanding and discussion of our business.", "I would like to comment on a couple of items relating to the acquisition of SanDisk and the related financing that will impact our future non-GAAP and GAAP results. First, relating to debt financing of the SanDisk acquisition, we will be amortizing the debt discount and issuance costs over the term of the debt, and this will result in charges that we will include in interest expense of $23 million in fiscal Q1 and approximately $18 million each quarter thereafter over the next five years. These debt discount and issuance costs are incremental to the cash interest payments we will make.", "Second, due to purchase accounting rules, we had to reset the SanDisk Japanese yen hedges for inventory purchases, eliminating approximately $51 million in unrealized gains that we would have reduced cost of sales by approximately $26 million in fiscal Q1 and $17 million in fiscal Q2. We will still receive the cash related to these yen hedges", "With that, I will now provide our guidance for the September quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect gross margin of approximately 32%, operating expenses of approximately $875 million, interest and other expense of approximately $245 million, tax expense of approximately $50 million, share count of approximately 290 million, and we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share between $0.85 and $0.90.", "I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's call. And our first question comes from the line of Sherry Scribner with Deutsche Bank Securities. Your line is now open.", "Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi. Thank you. I just was a little confused about the yen commentary that you made about the hedges. Can you maybe explain where that's going to sit and why that changed? And can you also help us understand what the impact of the yen will be going forward and how we should think about that for earnings. Thank you.", "Mark P. Long - Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Strategy Officer", "Sure, Sherry. So all we were describing in the commentary was the fact that the purchase accounting rules forced us or required us to eliminate certain benefits we would have otherwise had from the financial statements going forward by mark-to-market rules for the hedge instruments. So the impact, as we mentioned, is a total of $51 million in unrealized gains. Those gains would have been spread out over the next few quarters. And in fiscal Q1, we would have had a benefit of $26 million, and in fiscal Q2, we would have had a benefit of $17 million. The remainder would have applied in future quarters. So that accounts for the change in reporting due to purchase accounting.", "With respect to how we deal with the yen going forward, I think it's important to realize that our current combined company dependence on the yen is now significantly diminished. For SanDisk, their COGS were approximately 45% related to the yen. For the combined company, that dependence will drop to 15%. Nonetheless, we will continue our active hedging program to ensure that we are able to manage the volatility of the currency during the fiscal quarter and throughout the fiscal year through our hedging mechanisms.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And, Sherry, just this is Steve. Just to add one comment to that. I think that it's important to note, and we've gone through this in terms of our legacy hard drive business. There is always a number of different areas that create potential volatility in our business. It's our job from a management perspective to manage that volatility and to reduce its impact on our P&L, on our balance sheet, and corresponding impact on shareholders. So a fluctuation in the yen, just like changes in other variables that we deal with, our job is to manage that. By the way, absent the impact, I don't say absent, but even with the impact of purchase accounting, we're able to offset largely the impact in terms of the change in the value of the yen on our first quarter results. And I think it's important to emphasize that fact.", "Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. Your line is now open.", "Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC", "Thank you. A couple questions. I guess first when it comes to the OpEx, I assume that going forward you're just going to give a combined number for OpEx. Is there any sense you could give us today on the breakdown between the two business lines? And should we assume that from $875 million that it declines at some pace over the balance of fiscal 2017? Thanks.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So Rich, this is Steve. So the first thing is, is that we will only be providing total OpEx guidance going forward. We will not be providing, if you want to call it, separate legacy WDC or legacy SanDisk. As we move through the integration process, it will become kind of impossible to do that because we'll be combining \u2013 we're in the process of combining the companies. And then your assumption is correct that as we move through, one, through the tail end of calendar 2016 and into 2017 as we begin to realize synergies, we will see our OpEx begin to decline absent other investments that we need to make to continue to innovate in our business.", "Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC", "Okay. Then maybe this is best for Mike. Can you give us any sense on the high cap demand environment, in particular what the hyperscale build-out plans are over the next call it three to six months? Are you confident that the share, the overall share you've got should improve with the 10 terabyte as an example?", "Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah, I think that trend relative to overall share should be favorable with the adoption of the 10 terabyte. We also see the trend of petabyte growth moving to the high end of the range. So we would see the general demand situation in that group of customers as being steady and running at a slightly to the high end of the petabyte growth range, so approaching 40% is what you got to think about.", "Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC", "Okay, and thank you, Olivier, and congratulations, Mark.", "Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Mark P. Long - Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Strategy Officer", "Thanks, Rich.", "Operator", "Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks. Good afternoon. How should we think about the trajectory of gross margins from here, in not just the September quarter as the purchase accounting hit rolls off? It's a better pricing environment given the tighter NAND supply. And then how negative is the impact of ramping 3D NAND when you take those factors together? How should we just think from a high level about the trajectory of gross margins? Thank you.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, Katy. So to make a few comments. One thing just to, I'll call it, remind everybody is when we do the December 6 Investor Day, we'll obviously be providing updated margin range. We'll also be talking more qualitatively about the hierarchy of our margins between the three different, the slices of revenue that we're providing, data center as well as client devices, et cetera. And so we will be providing additional color going forward. Relative to the trajectory of our margins, it's a little bit early to make a call on that because there's obviously a lot of variables going on, which we sort of alluded to in Mike's commentary. So I don't want to get too over my skis in terms of forecasting of where we think our margins are going to trend. So I'll leave it at that.", "Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is now open.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah, thank you for taking the questions. The first question, and I have a follow-up real quick, you talked about the progression of the synergies and moving forward favorably on that front. I'm curious as you look specifically at the Hitachi integration and I think the target was exiting this year at $475 million of realized synergies, where did you come out this quarter with regard to realizing that level of synergies? And how do we think about the progression as we look through fiscal 2017?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So I'll take that and then Olivier or Mark can comment. First off, we are on track to achieving the synergy targets that we set for ourselves as well as outlined externally. We were not specific when we did that as to how that would reflect itself from a quarterly basis. We talked about where we would end up in terms of calendar 2016 as well as in calendar 2017. I believe that we suggested to the investment community that you use some sort of I'll call it straight-line projection in that regard. And I would say that generally speaking,", "that's about where we're at. But we're on track to our calendar year-end synergy targets.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then a real quick follow-up. Can you talk a little bit about the variables we should consider with regard to free cash flow generation as we move out over the next several quarters? What specifically CapEx trends we should think about?", "Mark P. Long - Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Strategy Officer", "So for the CapEx considerations, I think it's important to remember what the CapEx requirements were for each of the separate businesses and then we can think about them on a combined basis. So we were looking at 5% to 7% of revenue from the HDD business, although we were running a little below that. And then for cash CapEx for the SanDisk business, they were running in the 8% to 10% range. On a combined basis, I think it would be safe to look at something in the 6% to 8% range for planning purposes.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And then I would just add in terms of free cash flow, one of the things that we will be doing again in conjunction with the December Investor Day is resetting what we see as our cash conversion targets. We've got a bit more work to do on that as we increase our understanding and also look for optimization opportunities in terms of the combined business. And obviously with the profit ranges and in terms of margin, OpEx, et cetera, that will allow for a better modeling of where we think our free \u2013 operations cash flow will turn out. And then you would back off the CapEx from that to be able to estimate what our free cash flow would be going forward.", "Mark P. Long - Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Strategy Officer", "Right. And we tried to provide you with visibility into our cash interest expense by highlighting what we were amortizing in terms of the debt discount and issuance expenses. So I think you have the drivers of our free cash flow laid out.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital. Your line is now open.", "Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC", "Hey. Thanks, guys, for taking the questions. Congrats on a solid quarter. Olivier, we'll miss working with you. And, Mark, welcome. Two if I could, guys. I guess a little bit of an old school question. Steve, what's your TAM view for the second half of the year, calendar year now that the TAM was a little bit firmer than we all thought or at least you guys thought it might be entering the quarter? And then I have a follow-up as well. Thanks.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, so, Ananda, I would say that in terms of \u2013 I'm not going to make a call on the back half in terms of quantitatively, obviously. I'm going to give you a very dissatisfying answer. We would expect that the TAM will be higher in the second half than it was in the first half as a general statement. But more specifically as it relates to calendar Q3, our fiscal Q1, I would say that we would expect the hard drive TAM to be in the range of about 110 million units.", "Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC", "Okay. Okay. Great. No, that's actually very helpful in both regards. So and then the follow-up for me is just with regards to the near line commentary that you made, it sounds like you're expecting pretty solid near line demand in the second half of the year. I think the comment with regards to the 10 terabyte Helium ramping was you expect to, was it gain share as you go through that process? If you could clarify that.", "And then I guess a follow-on to that was I'd love your view on sort of where normalized share is on 8 terabyte since Seagate obviously seemed to get some meaningful volume back in the June quarter. Thanks.", "Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah, first is seasonality. We see it slightly higher, sort of a 48/52 on across the calendar year relative to petabyte linearity in the year. So heavier in the back half than the first. Yeah, I think my statements around 10 terabyte were interpreted correctly. I think we have ceded, as you might expect, some 8 terabyte share as our major competitor ramped. We think we're in a leading position on 10 terabyte, which will benefit us in the back half of the year.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And the other thing that I would add is we are not expecting to cede any more share.", "Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC", "That's very helpful. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now open.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group", "Thanks for taking my question. Looking at your guide and your commentary about a tight NAND supply, how should we think about the NAND ASP assumption that is dialed in? And is that a realistic assumption? Or if the tightness were to sustain, would there be a upside from a NAND ASP side? And I have a follow-up.", "Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah, I'll comment a little bit. Well, two things. One is we see the tightness through the end of the year, so that will have a benefit relative to bit price. We won't comment on the specifics of that. The way we also see it a little longer term, and this really relates to a new industry model, if you will, is the rate of bit cost decline is going to move into a regime that will center around a 20% or so per year we think. Barring supply/demand dynamics, that's the way the broader market should begin to look at the industry as we proceed into the 3D NAND era.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group", "Okay. Great. And since you mentioned next year and the mix of BiCS3 BIX 3, I'm just trying to better understand your strategy. And I do realize you're going to have an Analyst Day in December, but if the mix of BiCS3 is going to exceed your product expectation or going to have a higher mix of the 64 layer, do you foresee a scenario where you would better able to price your SSDs, or is that going to better help your raw NAND customer? How should we think about these mix shift and its impact to your product offering?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, my comment on part of this, but let me make one thing clear. Part of the strategy that SanDisk had and accordingly our strategy, which oh by the way, we concurred with, is that we want to manage technology transitions when it makes sense from a cost standpoint. So it, right now, we have the leading 2D planar technology from a cost standpoint. So we want to intersect 3D NAND technology when we think it is cost competitive to the incumbent 2D NAND technology. We believe that that will occur with our BiCS3 technology.", "And so, and we're pleased with the progress. We've still got a lot of work that we've got to do to go make that happen. And, but that's where we believe with 64 layers, that's where we believe that that cost crossover point will begin to occur, and we'll be ramping accordingly when that takes place through 2017. So I'll have Mike comment from kind of a product perspective.", "Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah, so in addition to sort of the general base of cost advantage that Steve just described, it really allows us to allocate sooner and a larger amount of 3D NAND into our broad product base. So we're going to apply it where it gives us most value first, which are our higher density applications or products. So you can imagine what those are, both classes of SSD and certain classes of off-embedded will benefit directly from that. So our ability to bring those products into the market sooner and at higher volume is the general way to think about that.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group", "Great. And I just wanted congratulate Olivier and best of luck in his next endeavor.", "Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Mehdi.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Steve and Mike, I was hoping you could maybe talk a little bit more about the underlying business patterns for both SSD and HDD. Especially, Steve, given your comment around the 110 million TAM for September. Can you talk about the puts and takes in terms of where maybe you're seeing some signs of life and renewal of the TAM (40:32) versus maybe some areas of challenge? And the same thing for the SSD piece.", "And then, Mark, I do appreciate the direction in the message in terms of around a more holistic reporting down the road, so we all look forward to that. I had a question though in terms of the gross margin. Could you talk a little about how we should think about the gross margin in the near to midterm? Is there any business that's going to be underperforming or out-earning before we get to the December Analyst Meeting on the margin side?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So you want to take it?", "Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So Mike can take the color on the 110 million TAM.", "Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah, so just thinking about it, I think the things to think about by segment, PC growth has moderated in terms of the declines. We've seen that flatten out. That's helpful as we enter into the second half as we see normal seasonality give us a little bit of a boost. I talked already about what our thoughts are around capacity enterprise. That will continue to be an area of growth within the hard drive segment. The other area to comment on is performance enterprise. We do see that continuing to have pressure from SSD. So there's been a downward trend in that market. We expect on a year over year basis something in the 25% range.", "And then lastly, gaming is up seasonally given the traditional holiday seasons, the current quarter is a high volume quarter for gaming. So that's a way to kind of dimension the HDD world. Within the broader solid state markets, I think I made reference to this in my comments. We're really seeing strong demand across all segments: embedded, client SSD, and ESSD or enterprise SSD. It's sort of as expected, but growth continues.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, and just a comment on our margins, then I'll ask Mark to add a comment about a little bit about the hierarchy of our margins. But I want to impress one point, that all of our margins by product continue to perform consistent with our expectations and what we would consider to be our own internal margin ranges. So no issues in terms of that, but I'll ask Mark to talk about kind of the hierarchy of our margins.", "Mark P. Long - Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Strategy Officer", "Sure. Mark. So basically when we look at the hierarchy of gross margin, the highest performing area for us is in the data center devices and solutions. Then that's followed by our client solutions, and then the third kind of level in the hierarchy is client devices. And as Steve pointed out, we are seeing the expected performance in each of those categories.", "Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks a lot. Thanks for taking my question, guys. Two for me as well.", "Robert Blair - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Hey, we can't hear you.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We can't hear you.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hopefully this is better.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes, it's better.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "I guess two questions. One, Mike, you talked about this 20% cost per bit decline as you go forward. Could you achieve that on the planer NAND side as well and would you have to go down half a node to get there in the next few quarters essentially or was that more a long-term comment you were making?", "Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer", "That's a long-term commentary and it's enabled by the 3D NAND transition in both initially and then subsequent generations.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Got it. And then I guess can you guys talk about the Samsung licensing revenues? Is the expectation that \u2013 SanDisk was getting that obviously \u2013 but is your expectation that that holds firm as you go forward and it gets renewed, or do you think that rolls off to a lower number at some point?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, a few clarifying comments. I mean first off, we nor SanDisk have historically disclosed the amount of the royalty from Samsung. The additional thing is, is that the current royalty arrangement is up for renewal and we're in discussions with Samsung regarding the terms of that renewal. I have nothing to report in terms of the status of that other than we're currently discussions with them. And then the additional point that I will make, which we talked about as part of the acquisition, is that when we did our forward modeling of the impact of that, we were I will call it relatively conservative in terms of our assumptions. And so we did not get overly aggressive as to what we thought, so we feel like we're sufficiently protected in terms of how that might turn out from a future financial modeling perspective.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Perfect. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Roy with UBS. Your line is now open.", "John M. A. Roy - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you. Hey, something a little mundane. Tax rate going forward, I know you guided to 20% to 25% for fiscal 2017 and 10% to 15% for fiscal 2018. Is that still what your thinking is, or can you narrow that range a little for us?", "Mark P. Long - Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Strategy Officer", "Well, as we pointed out, we will be providing a much more fulsome financial model at our Analyst Day in December. But I think it's safe to assume that the ranges we provided for the guidance will actually be slightly lower. And for fiscal 2017, we think it will be something in the range of 15% to 20%.", "John M. A. Roy - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stanley Kovler with Citi Research. Your line is now open.", "Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask you about your plans for production capacity going forward, especially in light of the TAM going up again next quarter. How should we think about where the industry capacity and specifically your capacity needs go particularly as we exit 2017 if there could be more pressure on PC units in particular? Are we thinking that may be going down to a 45 million sort of capacity level for you is something that could be additive to the cost synergies out there as well?", "And then again a related cost question, but on the SanDisk side. If we got the OpEx numbers right for WD standalone, it seems like the guidance for next quarter implies that the SanDisk OpEx is going up. I just wanted to see if you can provide a little bit more color on that. Thank you.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, so one of the things that \u2013 the first question has to do with HDD capacity, so just to comment on that. One of the things that Mike said, we have been very aggressive over a period of time of taking capacity out both in the form of brick and mortar as well as in terms of head count to react to the decline that we have seen in the hard drive market. And I want to emphasize those numbers. We've taken out 20% of our facilities and 25% of our head count over the course of the last two years. We also have, we have additional plans to reduce that further, up to one third and when you look at from two years ago. And so we will continue to be as proactive as we possibly can.", "Obviously our margins in terms of what we reported on the hard drive sides shows that we have done a pretty good job of managing the cost side of the equation in terms of our infrastructure and capacity. I have no doubt that we'll continue to do that going forward. In terms of your comment on OpEx, the one thing that I would like to emphasize is that our guidance for fiscal Q1 assumes a higher level of incentive compensation. So the increase is really a couple of different things. One, there is a full quarter of SanDisk OpEx, but also a higher level of short-term incentive compensation funding as compared to the prior for fiscal Q4. Next question?", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Joe Wittine with Longbow Research. Your line is now open.", "Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC", "Thank you. Is there anything you can offer on free cash expectations for 2017 after doing a little over $100 million last quarter? And with that, anything to offer as far as your thoughts behind the projected debt paydown schedule? Even qualitatively would be great. Thanks.", "Mark P. Long - Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Strategy Officer", "So in terms of free cash flow, we're going to provide updated guidance in December. So I think that's the soonest we'll give you more granularity.", "But in terms of our debt paydown schedule, I think it's safe to assume we're going to be aggressive where we can be to pay that down as quickly as we can. Our long-term commitment remains the three to five-year horizon getting to 1.5 times leverage. And as I mentioned, as we can find ways, whether it's our cash conversion cycle or other operational improvements that generate more free cash flow, we will look to use that to delever the balance sheet.", "Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC", "Got it. And then quickly on the legacy hard drive business, apologize if this was covered already, but the gap up in consumer units during the quarter, what drove that?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "The gap up. What do you mean by gap up?", "Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC", "I think it went from 7 million units to 10 million sequentially, big sequential move. I must have the wrong numbers.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I'm not sure what you're referring to.", "Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC", "Consumer HDD is 7.3 million in the March quarter, 10 million in the June quarter.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So that would be gaming.", "Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Gaming. It's all gaming.", "Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC", "Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ana Goshko with Bank of America. Your line is now open.", "Anastazia Goshko - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi. Thanks very much. First I wanted to clarify, on the CapEx guidance ranges that you gave, that includes incremental contributions into the flash JVs. Is that true?", "Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yes. Yes, it does. That's our cash CapEx range that we provided.", "Anastazia Goshko - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And then in the quarter, it looks like there was a $90 million contribution. What's the expectation on the SanDisk side for the CapEx that's at SanDisk proper? And how much do you expect to contribute into the JV going forward?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That would be implied in that 6% to 8%. Beyond that, we won't be providing specifics.", "Anastazia Goshko - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then secondly, I think the largest piece of the synergy case between the SanDisk/Western combination was the vertical integration on the NAND supply side. And I wanted to get an update on when you think you'll be able to start realizing that.", "Michael D. Cordano - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah, I think as we stated, we're going to do that through product life cycle adjustments. So we are not going to retroactively go back to existing products shipping to customers. So that's going to happen over the course of time. And really largely sort of 18 months and beyond we'll start to see that take more effect.", "Anastazia Goshko - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then this may be mundane, but I don't know if I caught a depreciation and amort projection for this coming quarter.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I don't believe that we provided one.", "Mark P. Long - Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Strategy Officer", "We did not.", "Anastazia Goshko - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Can I get one?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No.", "Anastazia Goshko - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Okay. Thank you, then.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with Benchmark. Your line is now open.", "Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC", "Anything on the long awaited transition to energy assisted magnetic recording? Is that 2017, or that keeps on getting pushed out?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I would say it's 2018, 2019 kind of dynamic.", "Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC", "Okay. So it's fallen out. Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Your line is now open. Please check your mute button, Vijay.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Yeah, hey. Sorry about that. Just on the OpEx level, where do you see the long-term OpEx level? I know it's $875 million here. Where do you see it longer term?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That's an additional item that we'll be providing more color on in December. We're still scrubbing through the details.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Okay. And on the gross margin line, what are the puts and takes as you look out? What drives it? Where do you see upside coming from as we look out couple of quarters here?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well that's a very general question. And so, again, we'll be providing more information in December in terms of our gross margin range. But obviously the puts and takes, it's going to be dependent upon the usual things, what happens with mix, what happens with pricing, what happens with demand. Obviously right now in terms of what Mike was alluding to, we've got a favorable supply/demand situation in terms of NAND. That's helping our margin profile from an overall perspective. And hard drive market is relatively stable, certainly from a demand perspective.", "But as Mike alluded to, we continue to see some share-based pricing behavior in certain parts of the market that's kind of offsetting maybe some of the more positive things that we're seeing in terms of mix and demand on the hard drive side. So there's various different puts and takes. But on balance, we see at least in the near term an upward trajectory from 31% to 32% in terms of our gross margin percentage.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "All right. And just last question here on the yen. I might have missed the first part of that, but were you mentioning the unrealized hedging gains in the yen? Do you expect that to \u2013 does that flow through the EPS line in coming quarters or how do you see that $35 million (sic) [$26 million] (56:01) and $17 million in [indiscernible] (56:07)?", "Mark P. Long - Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Strategy Officer", "So first of all, let me clarify. That is just purchase accounting. So it will not flow through the P&L for Q1 and Q2 and beyond for the instruments that we had at the time of the closing of the transaction. So all our new hedging instruments will flow through in the customary manner. Now, we still get the cash benefit of those instruments, but you will see effectively it's what would otherwise have been a decrease in the next few quarters as a result of that purchase accounting requirement.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Got it. Best of luck. Thank you.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Phipps with Citigroup. Your line is now open.", "David Phipps - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks for taking my question. Can I ask you about the operating expenses in the fourth quarter? Because combined, those were about $484 million. In the coming quarter, you've guided to $875 million. So what were the unusual charges or if any, within those two line items.", "Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Nothing unusual. And again, the complexity with the guide is you compare a full quarter with a quarter not including obviously SanDisk for the full period. And as we indicated earlier, the incentive compensation now will be fully funded, which wasn't the case before. So the reconciliation is a bit tricky. But nothing out of the ordinary.", "David Phipps - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "So the current quarter was $484 million of op expenses including $70 million of stock comp. And so the next quarter will be $875 million, and I guess we'll have a lower component of stock comp.", "Olivier Leonetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So stock-based compensation is excluded from all the numbers we are communicated.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "It's included. You'll have a full quarter, so it will actually be higher stock comp. We'll repeat the answer. The primary difference between F Q4 and F Q1 OpEx is having a full quarter of SanDisk OpEx plus a higher level of incentive compensation funding. That's the primary difference.", "David Phipps - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "But wouldn't that be \u2013 so that should be a bigger number than a smaller number. Isn't that? What am I missing?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We'll have to take this offline, okay?", "David Phipps - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Nehal Chokshi from Maxim Group. Your line is now open.", "Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC", "Thank you. The exabytes shipped, does that include the NAND flash component now?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Repeat that. I'm sorry.", "Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC", "The exabytes shipped, the 66.1 in the June quarter, does that include the NAND flash shipments as well?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes.", "Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC", "It does. Okay. So there was an acceleration on a year over year growth, so is that primarily attributable to the inclusion of NAND flash?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No. It would be primarily driven by capacity enterprise shipments.", "Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC", "Got it. Okay. And then my follow-up is that you had about $100 million upside relative to the original midpoint guidance. And given the ASP uptick, which I think is due to the mix shift to the capacity enterprise, it sounds like it was largely capacity enterprise that drove all this. And could you give some additional color as far as where that demand from capacity enterprise was? It sounds like it's hyperscale, but just want to make sure it's just hyperscale and there's no upside from the enterprise storage OEMs as well.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, just to make an overall comment, because remember we provided guidance prior to the acquisition of the SanDisk, which SanDisk which was obviously legacy WDC. Our financial results for F Q4 for legacy WDC came in largely consistent with our expectations. So primarily the upside that we saw was driven by if you want to call it legacy SanDisk or our new flash-based business over that stub period.", "Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC", "I see. Thank you.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. All right. So I want to thank you for joining us today. In closing, I want to thank Olivier Leonetti for his contributions as our Chief Financial Officer over the last two years. We greatly appreciate Olivier's dedication during this transformative time and wish him the best in the future.

All participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "I now will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair. You may begin.", "Robert Blair - Western Digital Corp.", "Thank you. And good afternoon, everyone. This conference call will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements concerning our expected financial performance for our second fiscal quarter ending December 30, 2016, our market positioning and growth opportunities, our strategic platform, integration activities and achievement of synergy goals, demand in market trends, the benefits of our short-term incentive compensation programs, our product portfolio, product features and their benefits, product transitions and other development efforts and customer acceptance of our products and manufacturing yields and cost improvements.", "These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on August 29, 2016.

Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort.", "In the question-answer session part of our call today, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up to allow as many callers as possible during our allotted time. I thank you in advance for that.", "And I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Steve Milligan.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights and Mark will cover the fiscal first quarter results and wrap-up with our guidance for the fiscal second quarter.", "I'm pleased with our performance in the September quarter, our first full quarter as an integrated company following the SanDisk acquisition in May. We reported revenue of $4.7 billion, non-GAAP gross margins of 34%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.18, exceeding our revised guidance in each category.", "We continued to experience strong demand throughout the September quarter for both hard drive and flash-based products from all categories of customers, largely driven by cloud and mobility based applications, as well as better than expected PC demand and our own outperformance in certain categories. These trends are expected to continue in the December quarter.", "We are delivering our financial performance through continued strong execution by the newly-combined Western Digital team, demonstrating the power of our broad-based and unique platform. The platform includes an unparalleled breadth of storage product offerings, expanded vertical integration and go-to-market capabilities, an increasing level of customer intimacy and a proven ability to innovate and sustain leadership across multiple storage technologies.", "We have made significant progress establishing this strategic platform by combining and leveraging the collective strengths and resources of legacy HGST, SanDisk and WD. Our platform is aligned with our vision of the continued rapid growth of data and its increasing importance in our everyday lives. The power and promise of data is undeniable. It is creating a world that's more predictive, more productive and more personal, enabling smarter decisions, breakthrough discoveries and deeper connections.", "The Western Digital platform is at the core of enabling the possibilities of data. It differentiates us from our competitors and we believe it will drive our company to a future of growth and long-term industry leadership. We are already seeing the benefits of the platform in our differentiated financial results and outlook. I am very pleased that we have achieved this financial performance, while, at the same time, successfully executing on two top priorities, namely, the integrations of HGST, SanDisk and WD, and the transition to next-generation NAND technology.", "Integration of the three companies is proceeding very well, and our synergy achievements are on track. I'm also pleased to note that our transition to 3D NAND technology continues to progress as planned and we will begin a significant commercial ramp of our second-generation 3D NAND with 64 layers in the first half of calendar 2017, as previously announced.", "Mike Cordano will now report on our business highlights in the September quarter.", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased with our operational execution and the resulting business performance for the September quarter. The industry supply/demand environment in both HDDs and flash was favorable. With a full quarter of the legacy SanDisk business results integrated into the company, our Q1 report reflects the strength of our broad portfolio addressing a similarly expanded market opportunity.", "As part of our mission to build a compelling Western Digital platform, we continue to make progress with integrating the HGST and SanDisk businesses and we are on pace with our plan to further streamline our product and technology base (7:06).", "Turning to our highlights in the quarter. In data center devices and solutions, we delivered solid year-over-year growth in total exabytes shipped, primarily driven by continued strength in cloud-related demand for our near-line capacity HDDs, with that product category alone driving almost 50% year-over-year growth in exabytes shipped.", "I'm very pleased to report that our industry-leading 10 terabyte helium drive gained further adoption at several of our major OEM and cloud customers, reflecting the compelling value proposition of this offering. Just two weeks ago, we achieved an important milestone for our HelioSeal platform, with cumulative shipments exceeding 10 million units, representing approximately 76 exabytes of storage capacity since the launch of this platform in late 2013.", "This technology, now in its third generation, enables even higher density HDDs specifically designed for data center applications and will be able to incorporate future magnetic recording technologies. In data center solutions, we are pleased with SoftBank's adoption of our InfiniFlash all-flash storage platform for their new software-defined storage solution.", "In client devices, we experienced strong demand for our HDDs and SSDs for PCs, as that market continued to show signs of stabilization and we outperformed in both product categories. Our 3 bits per cell based embedded NAND solutions saw increased adoption in mobile phones, as this technology offers a compelling value proposition compared to 2 bits per cell based alternatives. I am pleased to note that our embedded 3 bits per cell solutions are now qualified and shipping to the majority of the world's top mobile handset vendors.", "We are now deepening our participation in the automotive, connected home and industrial categories, reflecting our commitment to driving innovations beyond the traditional mobile application. These are important long-term growth opportunities with longer product cycles for both our embedded and removable offerings.", "Our performance in client solutions, which includes retail offerings from legacy HGST, SanDisk and WD, was strong during the September quarter, and our combined portfolio of flash and HDD products has generated excellent reception from customers. Following a successful back-to-school sales period, performance in our retail channel remains solid, reflecting strength in both demand trends as well as preference for our brands. We demonstrated continued innovation in our removable product categories with the announcement of the world's first 1 terabit SD card.", "From a NAND technology perspective, we have begun OEM sampling of our second generation of 3D NAND technology of 64 layers and we're on track to deliver volume shipments of removable product with this technology in the December quarter. Our previously discussed plan to begin a significant commercial ramp of 64-layer 3D NAND in the first half of calendar year 2017 remains on track. Our first generation of 3D NAND technology with 3 bits per cell in a 48-layer architecture is shipping in embedded mobile and removable products. We continue to ship products using our 15 nanometer 2D NAND technology, which is achieving new manufacturing milestones in terms of yields and cost improvements.", "In summary, I'm pleased with our first quarter performance and the execution by our team. The opportunities we are creating through integrating HGST, SanDisk and WD are significant and we are making good progress in setting up Western Digital for long-term growth and success. In the December quarter, we expect overall supply/demand conditions in both HDD and NAND to remain constrained resulting in favorable industry dynamics. The longer-term drivers of demand for storage are vibrant and we are focused on our offering industry-leading portfolio to drive the best results for our customers and shareholders.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussion.", "Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.", "Thank you, Mike. I'm encouraged by our financial performance this quarter. Our teams executed well in a solid market environment as we capitalized on our strong product offering, achieved targeted costs and efficiency improvements and reduced our cost of debt, primarily due to two re-pricing transactions. Our key financial metrics continued to improve following the revised guidance we provided on September 7 due to both favorable market dynamics and consistent execution by our team.", "Our revenue for the September quarter was $4.7 billion, driven by strong performance across each of our end-markets. Revenue in datacenter devices and solutions was $1.4 billion, client devices was $2.3 billion, and client solutions was $1 billion. Our datacenter revenue growth continues to be driven largely by cloud-related storage demand. As a result, we saw continued strength in capacity enterprise HDDs, stable demand for performance enterprise HDDs, as well as positive market dynamics for enterprise SSDs. Client devices benefited from seasonally strong demand for HDDs in gaming and PC applications as well as flash-based products in PCs and mobile handsets.", "In client solutions, our revenue grew as a function of seasonality and healthy demand for removable and other flash-based products. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 33.6%, which was up 260 basis points versus the June quarter. We were able to achieve this margin expansion through continued product cost improvements and better than anticipated pricing for certain HDD and flash products. Our product cost improvement resulted from increased volumes, consistent execution and ongoing progress with our integration activities. Gross margin also benefited from our first full quarter of flash revenue, which helped to offset the seasonal increase in lower margin HDD gaming revenue, the latter of which typically peaks in the September quarter.", "Turning to the discussion of operating expenses. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $952 million. We incurred higher short-term incentive compensation due to stronger business performance, which nonetheless was partially offset by continued progress towards our integration synergy target.", "Let me take a few moments to explain our short-term incentive compensation program. It is based on goals set on a semiannual basis. We believe this semiannual approach to incentive compensation allows us to effectively navigate changing market environments. To understand the underlying business performance, it is useful to normalize these payments across periods. For example, the payouts in the first six months of calendar 2016 were significantly below target, while the payouts for the second half are currently expected to be above target. As a result, the annualized payout would be at a roughly 100% target level.", "Non-GAAP interest and other expense for the quarter was $227 million. On August 17, we reduced our U.S. Term Loan B balance by $750 million through a voluntary prepayment and repriced the remaining $3 billion balance. On September 22, we repriced our euro-denominated Term Loan B with a balance of \u20ac885 million. The aggregate annual non-GAAP and cash interest savings from the two repricing transactions are approximately $150 million and $120 million, respectively, on a going forward basis. These transactions resulted in $267 million of debt extinguishment charges in our GAAP interest and other expenses, $227 million of which were non-cash charges.", "Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the September quarter was approximately 16%, within our expected range of 15% to 20% for this period. On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the September quarter was $341 million, or $1.18 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had a net loss of $366 million, or $1.28 per share. The GAAP net loss for the period includes charges associated with our recent acquisitions, debt extinguishment charges related to our repricing and repayment of outstanding debt.", "Essentially, the entire net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is a result of non-cash charges. In the September quarter, we generated $440 million of cash from operations, with $210 million spent on capital investments resulting in free cash flow of $230 million. We also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share.", "We closed the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 billion, compared to the June quarter end balance of $8.2 billion. The decrease was primarily driven by repayment of $4.2 billion of debt, consisting of the acquisition bridge loan, U.S. Term Loan B and SanDisk convertible debt.", "As Steve and Mike indicated, we have continued to make very good progress with respect to our integration. From a synergy standpoint, we remain on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017, and expect to exit the December quarter of this year having achieved more than $175 million of cost of revenue synergies and approximately $300 million of operating expense synergies each on an annual run rate basis.", "With respect to the SanDisk integration, we expect to exit the December quarter having realized synergies of approximately $130 million on an annual run rate basis toward our 18-month target of achieving $500 million of total run rate synergies on an annualized basis.", "Now, I would like to describe a change we are implementing in our non-GAAP reporting, beginning with our December quarter. To better reflect the performance of the underlying business operations in our results, and to be more consistent with the majority of our technology peers, we will be excluding stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP results. All future guidance, including today's for the December quarter, will be on this basis.", "The stock-based compensation portion of our total operating expenses is typically between $75 million and $85 million per quarter. If we had made this change in our September quarter, our non-GAAP operating expenses would have declined $89 million from $952 million to $863 million, our non-GAAP cost of revenue would have also decreased $15 million and our non-GAAP tax expense would have been reduced $3 million. The total stock-based compensation expense impact would have increased non-GAAP net income by $107 million to $448 million. Non-GAAP EPS would have increased from $1.18 to $1.54. We are posting this data with some historical comparisons on the Investor Relations section of our website for your information.", "With that, I will now provide our guidance for the December quarter on the new non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation expense. While the September quarter is typically the high point of our revenue due to seasonality, we expect our December quarter revenue to be equally strong due to the continuation of favorable industry dynamics and the success of our broadened product portfolio. As such, we now expect revenue in our December quarter to be approximately flat to the September quarter.", "On a non-GAAP basis, we expect gross margin to increase to approximately 35%, driven by improved product mix reflecting lower gaming volume and outperformance in other key areas. I would like to note that we have only included half a quarter of license and royalty revenue from our cross-license agreement with Samsung, which, as you know, expired on August 14 and under which revenue was recognized one quarter in arrear. We remain in constructive negotiations with Samsung, working toward a new agreement and will provide further updates as this situation changes.", "Turning to operating expenses. We expect those to total approximately $805 million, which includes higher variable compensation expense given our outperformance of the targets set for the first six months of our fiscal year. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $205 million, reflecting a full quarter benefit from our lower interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs from the debt repricing and paydown transactions.", "We expect an effective tax rate in the 14% to 16% range. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.85 and $1.95, with an estimated share count 293 million diluted shares. I would note, on our previous non-GAAP basis including stock-based compensation expense, the high end of our earnings per share guidance would have been approximately $1.60.", "At our Investor Day on December 6, we will provide a deeper dive into our strategy, business operations, technology capabilities and long-term financial model, which should give further clarity on what we expect to deliver across key financial metrics for the new Western Digital.", "I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's call. Our first question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hi. This is (23:19) on behalf of Rod. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is on your revenue beat. I see that your net revenue is 4% ahead of your pre-announcement, which only happened last month. So what kind of linearity trends you are seeing? Did the market trends accelerate towards the back half of the quarter?", "Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.", "Sure. So for the quarter, linearity was very strong. And we experienced strong demand and favorable pricing since the guidance we provided in early September.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "Yeah. So if you look at it, of our revenue over-achievement from our previous guidance of $4.5 billion to the $4.7 billion, about 80% of that over-achievement was due to higher than expected demand and the balance was a bit better pricing.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay. Great. As a follow-up, could you comment on your expectations for the NAND market bit growth as well as your bit growth? And then a bit on your expectations for pricing?", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "Yeah. So talking about the current calendar year, we would expect that bit growth to be around the mid-30%, about 35% for the industry. And in our case, we had previously talked about something in the low-30% induced to some very good work by our operational teams that will be closer to the industry rate exiting this year. We'd expect next year to be in the mid-40%s, approximately 45%, both for the industry and for ourselves as we transition as an industry and we transition to 3D NAND technology.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah. Thank you for taking the questions and congratulations on the quarter. As we think about building our models and you look at the variable compensation components that are included in the expectations, how should we think about variable comp going into the December quarter? And I think at one conference, you had recently noted that that will start to tail off as you realize some of the synergies from these integrations, particularly HGST.", "Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.", "So the variable comp that is really driving the deltas here is our short-term bonus that's paid over a six-month horizon, as I was indicating earlier. And so for Q4, calendar Q4, we'll still have some of that effect. But as you go into calendar Q1, our fiscal Q3, that effect will be eliminated as we reset the target. And our forecast would include a normalized 100% target achievement there.", "So the best way to think about this normalized OpEx is that, from a calendar Q1 standpoint through to really the end of fiscal 2017, you're going to see a steady trend downward. So, first, when we talk about normalizing, we exclude the stock-based compensation. And then we bring our short-term bonus to 100%.", "So for the first six months of the calendar year, as we said, you'll actually be adding back some of the bonus that we didn't pay because we were below that 100% target. And for the remainder of the calendar year 2016, you would be deducting that overage, and then for the first half of calendar 2017, you would not have that short-term bonus effect.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, I'm just curious on cloud pretty universally has been cited as strong across many different companies. I'm curious beyond the December quarter how you're currently thinking about cloud demand, near-line demand, in particular going into the first half of 2017?", "Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.", "Yeah. Let me just follow up and give you another data point because we're conscious of the challenges modeling some of the transitions here. But when you think about the first quarter of calendar 2017, I want to kind of give you a perspective on where the normalized OpEx should range. And a way to think about that for modeling purposes would be in the $770 million range. So, hopefully, that helped.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "So, we wanted to close off that, Aaron, and Mike can talk about cloud demand.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Perfect. Very helpful.", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "Sure. All right. Relative to the cloud demand capacity enterprise, specifically I noted in my prepared remarks, we saw a year-over-year increase of nearly 50%. We see this year in total running around 38% or above our long-term model of 35%. As we look into calendar 2017, we're not updating our long-term model at this point. But, we would suggest that things will run to sort of a bias up above that kind of consistent with what we're seeing this year.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thank you. Good luck.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "Mehdi Hosseini, thank you.", "David Ryzhik - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Yeah, actually it's not Mehdi, it's David Ryzhik for Mehdi Hosseini on the line. Thank you so much for taking the question. Can you guys talk about your HDD capacity in terms of units and/or exabytes? And what you've done in that regard and how that trend over the next quarters? And in that context, how we can think about capacity utilization? And I have a follow-up.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "Yeah. So, this is Steve, I'll take that. So I would say that, I mean, there's a lot of dynamics that are going on in terms of our hard drive capacity because as you know, over the last kind of several years, we've been going through a manufacturing rationalization process given declines that we've seen in the hard drive market. So, there are kind of different puts and takes when you look at various different products for various different factory locations. But on balance right now in terms of hard drive manufacturing, I would say that we are kind of reasonably balanced. In other words, we're able to largely meet overall customer demand. And again, we're going to continue to rationalize this as we move forward.", "The one thing that we're a little bit cautious about and keeping our eye on is that, obviously when you're talking about capacity enterprise products, which, as Mike indicated, the demand in that space has been reasonably robust. And that uses a lot of heads and disks because of the platter count. And we have less flexibility both in terms of lead time and capacity in terms of heads and disks.", "And so as we look at that and as we watch and work closely with our customers, if for one reason or another we would see, call it, a spike from a demand perspective, our ability to meet some of that upside might be more limited. So, that's one thing that we're a bit cautious on right now. But overall, we feel pretty good about where we're at from a utilization and capacity perspective on the HDD front.", "David Ryzhik - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Great. Thanks, Steve. And as a follow-up for Mark, how can we think about the cash conversion cycle, and more broadly speaking, like a normalized free cash flow rate as you've gotten your arms around the balance sheet and cash generation capability? Just any insight in how we can model that going forward. Thanks.", "Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.", "Sure. So from a cash conversion cycle standpoint, I think you can model basically where we've been over the last couple of quarters, but you'll have some changing dynamics. So what I would expect is inventory will likely trend up and this is really a function of us building strategic reserves as we restructure parts of our supply chain. And then eventually, you'll see the NAND parts of our business, the allocation will begin to soften and we'll begin to build more inventory. So, that will trend upwards a little bit, but you'll then I think see payables be extended from where they were in Q1. So, I think, overall, you'll see a cash conversion cycle in about the range that it's been.", "And in terms of the cash flow generation margin, we're actually going to have a little bit more noise in that equation for the next few quarters, primarily as a function of our restructuring and ongoing integration activities. But, one of the things we will be doing during Investor Day is providing more visibility into the dynamics of that as well as a way to think about our long-term financial modeling and the key metric around cash flow generation.", "David Ryzhik - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Great. Thanks, Mark.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Jeriel Ong - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hey, this is Jeriel on behalf of Amit. I just have a few questions here. Number one, can you just touch on what drove the gross margin upside? I think it was up about 60 basis points versus your positive pre and 160 basis points versus initial guide. Was this more HDD or NAND or cost integration, and some rank order would be valuable?", "Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.", "So I think as we mentioned, the favorable pricing was across both parts of our business, but primarily in the NAND area. And we did experience some additional benefits from mix, especially given the fact that we had the first full quarter of the flash product revenue.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "Yeah. And also the strong performance in terms of capacity enterprise as well.", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "And I mean, there's a lot of dynamics. The other thing I'd just add is that we continue to make progress in terms of our integration synergy goals. So, that continues to provide some headwind \u2013 or not headwind, tailwinds for us in terms of our margin performance. So, it was really kind of oversimplified, it was kind of a little bit of everything, kind of across the board.", "Jeriel Ong - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "All right. Thanks for that.", "Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.", "Yeah. Just to finish that thought, we would expect those same drivers to carry forward into the second fiscal quarter and that's driving the expansion of gross margin.", "Jeriel Ong - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thank you. And as a follow-up, I understand that you're only including about 45 days of that Samsung contribution, which makes sense. If or when you get a resolution with Samsung, would they back pay your payments from November 15 onwards or...", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "We would certainly hope so, yes, because the agreement expired on August 14. So when we put a new agreement in place, we would expect it to be retroactive to that date.", "Jeriel Ong - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "All right. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of James Kisner with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "James Kisner - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you very much. So I believe you said near-line demand was up 50% year-over-year in exabytes shipped. I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit on how that translates to revenue change year-over-year, and I guess, related to that, change in price per bit year-over-year. And I guess relatedly, have you seen a more rational competitive environment for near-line and what has happened to your share in near-line quarter-on-quarter? Thanks.", "Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.", "So from a translation to a revenue standpoint, it's about half that in terms of the increase in revenue.", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "Yeah. In terms of market dynamics, I think we think it's fairly balanced and as we expected. And I think relative to total bit participation, we think we've improved our position sequentially and we see a trend of that going forward really relative to our increasing sales of our 10 terabyte offering.", "James Kisner - Jefferies LLC", "All right. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC", "Thanks. Good afternoon. Just getting back to your revenue guidance for a second, I was wondering if there's any other puts and takes you can talk to in terms of how you get to the flat, either by the three business segments you've established or maybe even hopefully by some product categories as well? And then I had an enterprise follow-up question.", "Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.", "Sure. So let me talk about our end-markets. For datacenter devices, you can think about that whole category being roughly flat. When it comes to client devices, I think within that, while the whole category again will be roughly flat, you'll have some puts and takes. You'll see continued strength in client SSD, but we'll see gaming and, to some extent, notebook HDDs sort of come off that seasonal peak and then we'll see a little strength in desktop. When it comes to our client solutions, we actually see strength across both our HDD and flash-based products. So I think on balance, it's flat to slightly up for each of the three categories.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "The largest single variable there is that seasonality of the gaming marketplace, so that peaks, as Mark said, in calendar Q3. So that's the largest single variable within that.", "Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC", "Great. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, as you mentioned, you have a unique view into enterprise storage now. I was wondering if you could just compare average capacity trends between HDDs and SSDs into some of the cloud data centers that you have projects in and how the growth rates compare and contrast. Thank you very much.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "Yeah, on a growth rate basis, the capacity growth rate for flash exceeds that of disk. And so that trend continues. That's been ongoing for some time and that's really specifically related to hyperscale deployments.", "Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Good afternoon. Just one question for me, tagging onto that last question. So Micron, for example, has been touting its 15 terabyte drive. And I'm just interested in, may be best from Mike, how do you see the next few years playing out on the highest capacity points between hard drives and SSDs? How do you position these two? And does WD get to a point where it just is indifferent to whatever people select for cloud hyperscale environments? Thanks.", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "Yeah. So I think, Rich, it still begins with the workload and then the cost per bit that optimally supports that workload. So going forward, we don't see a convergence to an all-flash world anytime soon, frankly, anytime in our planning horizon. So what we do see is continued growth of capacity enterprise that we articulated. That's going be long into the future, although flash revenue and flash bits on a proportionate basis is growing faster. So from that standpoint, that's the trend we would point you to.", "And they have very different purposes in the hierarchy. So we continue to obviously work closely with those and are innovating around data center architectures and we intend to deploy our technology and our products in an optimal way to those trends.", "Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC", "How much of a price differential is there today between the SSD version and a comparable capacity hard drive?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "It varies depending on performance requirements, et cetera, but it would run between 5X and 10X.", "Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. I apologize if the questions have been asked. I've been jumping between a couple calls. The first question is, can you talk a little more about next year if demand improvement in both flash and disk drives continue from an end market perspective, could we see any capacity cuts driving a shortage or a constraint issue next year from one or both segments?", "And the other question is around the exclusion of stock options. Can you talk a little more about the philosophy there, just given that we were aware of SanDisk and the overhang there previously, why the change now and what's the impetus? That would be great. Thank you.", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "Okay. Let me talk about the supply/demand environment. We said publicly and we'll reiterate here that we see constrained supply in the NAND side of our business through calendar year 2017. And that's primarily driven by two things, end market demand for that class of technology and the rate and pace of the industry's conversion to 3D NAND. Relative to the hard drive market, I think at this point we would see that as a normal or balanced environment.", "Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.", "And then, Mark, with respect to the decision to exclude stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP results, we really had two primary drivers. One was just the way we run the business. And our stock-based compensation expense actually has some elements of it that are either short term in nature or are variable. And as a result, it injects some variability that undermines our ability to demonstrate or track the improvements we're making from a synergy realization standpoint. So that's the first driver.", "The second driver is that we are more and more focused on our cash flow generation and looking at our results from a cash standpoint, particularly given our balance sheet. And by excluding the stock-based compensation, we are better able to highlight and track the cash flow impact of our operating decision.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "Now, one thing, Mark, that I will add to that. This is Steve. Is that we fully recognize the fact that there is an impact in the form of dilution from stock-based compensation and we remain not only aware of that, but sensitive of that. And if you look at our proxy statement in terms of compensation philosophies and that sort of thing, there's no change in that regard in terms of what we're doing. It's more a matter of excluding those figures to provide more meaningful analytical information, if you want to call it that, to the financial community. But I don't want people to think that we don't recognize the fact that there is a dilution component as it relates to our existing shareholders.", "Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.", "And Mark, I think as you know, part of the calculus was looking at the comparable peers. And what they do to try to provide an easier basis for comparison, so.", "Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I know it's difficult to guide NAND gross margins since ASPs are beyond your control. But do you think your cost improvement will be above or below your long-term expectations of 20% in 2016 as you ramp 3D? And maybe, what's your expectation in 2017, calendar 2017, as 3D becomes a larger part of your mix? And I have a follow up, please.", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "Okay. So we've talked about sort of the cost reduction domain of kind of three generations \u2013 or three periods in the NAND industry. Very early on, it was running at around a 50% annualized rate. The next period was running at about a 30% rate. Frankly, that's now ending as we come to the conclusion of plainer NAND. As we move fully as an industry into 3D, once we're through the transition, we expect around a 20% per year cost reduction capability. So, that's the way we would guide you to think about that. Obviously, there are some perturbations as we transition from 2D to 3D, but that's the way to think about it from a long-term modeling perspective.", "Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Got it. I can appreciate that. And then in the context of your bit growth outlook for calendar 2017 that you just gave and also your past comments that 3D NAND will be 40% of your overall bit output by the end of next calendar year, should we expect the majority of your 3D outlook to be 64-layer or will it be more weighted toward 48-layer?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "It will be 64-layer. And I think we have \u2013 what's the right number for exit rate in 2017?", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "It's around 40%, but its wafers out.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "Oh. Okay. So not bit output, it's just wafers out? Okay. So the 40% is wafers out.", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "Correct. And the other comment I'll make, just to clarify, 48-layer, we've talked about, is really a learning node for us. So, to just reiterate what Steve said, the volume as we exit next calendar year will be predominantly the 64-layer.", "Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC", "Hi, guys. Hey, congratulations and thanks for taking the question. One and then a quick follow up. Steve, would love your, I guess, your context on given that on the hard drive side of things, the capacity in the industry is pretty well rationalized, and I guess, has the potential based on cloud growth going into next year to maybe be, it sounds fantastic, but close to 100% by midyear. What implications, if any, does that then have on, I guess, the context, the tenor of your relationships with customers, your conversations with customers, business practices with customers in any regard? Would love to get your sense there and then I have a quick follow up on a different topic.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "Well, yeah, and Mike can help me with this as well, but I think that one of the things that has really happened over a period of time, because as the hyperscale guys grow, and they get bigger, and as they need to add capacity and their growth is accelerating. And so you just get into, call it, the law of large numbers. We have to do a much better job working with the hyperscale guys on longer-term capacity planning.", "And so, we believe we've done a good job on that because we don't \u2013 they don't want to ask us for product and us not have it. And then, clearly, we don't want to gap out on them. And so, it's driven in effect a much more close-knit planning process, longer-term planning process, which the good side of that is that it allows for a little bit more predictability in terms of what's going on in that side of the business, because there was a time \u2013 well, it can still happen.", "But there's been conversations about the lumpiness of the business and that can still occur. But because of the dynamics that we're seeing, we're actually getting into a little bit more longer-term planning and a little bit more predictability in terms of what's happening from a demand perspective. Mike can kind of add to that.", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "Yeah, and I'll just sort of reiterate some of the reasons this is. So, we've talked about this long-term growth rate of 35%. We've been, as an industry, achieving that with a number of efficiency factors flowing through. We've highlighted in the past both technological as well as operational. So, technologically, things like erasure coding are widely deployed now in that infrastructure. So, the sort of efficiency gains technologically, although we expect some in the future, the largest magnitude of that has sort of run its course.", "The other one is operational efficiency and that underpins what Steve said. They're maturing as operational units, their ability to sort of do things like manage inventory and repurpose and reutilize their fleet. Those processes are maturing. So, really, what we now see and perhaps one of the reasons we're seeing a bias up on the exabyte growth rate is we're kind of working through those things and we're starting to approach a more natural storage deploy requirement. So that's something we'll continue to monitor and see how that trends. At this point, we'll kind of stick with 35%, but as I said, I think our bias would be up from there going forward.", "Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC", "And Steve and Mike, was sort of working more closely with those folks, would that include anything in the context of contractual alterations? Could a long-term \u2013 I'm just coming up off the top of my head, long-term contracts play into it in any context, maybe capital sharing play into it in any context, anything with financial implications?", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "Well, I'll say this. I think the general view of us now as we put together this broader set of assets is we're more relevant, we're more strategically important, and our engagement is changing with the broader marketplace. So, things along those lines and other strategic things are all sort of more possible now.", "Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC", "Got it. Thanks so much.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "Thank you. So, I want to thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day on December 6.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "Now, I would turn the call over to Mr. Jay Iyer. You may begin.", "Jay Iyer - Western Digital Corp.", "Thank you, Latif. And good afternoon, everyone. This conference call will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws including statements concerning our expected future financial performance, our market positioning, expectations regarding growth opportunities, our financial and business strategies and execution, integration activities and achievements of synergy goals, demand and market trends, our product portfolio, product features, development efforts and expansion into new data storage markets by evolving relationships with customers, and our joint venture partnership and business ventures with Toshiba.", "These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 8, 2017.", "Any applicable forward-looking commentary is exclusive of one-time transactions and does not reflect the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures or other transactions that may be announced after July 27, 2017.

Accordingly, a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort.", "In the question-answer part of today's call, we ask you that you limit yourself to one question to allow as many callers as possible to ask a question. Thank you in advance for your cooperation.", "With that, I will turn the call over to our CEO, Steve Milligan.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer.", "After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal fourth quarter and full-year financials and wrap up with our guidance for the fiscal first quarter before we take your questions.", "We reported strong financial performance in the June quarter to complete an outstanding fiscal 2017. Our unique platform of diverse storage technologies and value-added products helped drive this performance, as we addressed a broader set of markets following the SanDisk acquisition.", "On a pro forma basis, we operated near the top of our revenue growth model with 7% year-over-year top-line growth, and we delivered very healthy margins. As a result of our unique platform, relationships with our customers are more strategic in recognition of our changing role and the data storage ecosystem.", "For the June quarter, we reported revenue of $4.8 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 41% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.93. We generated strong operating cash flow reflecting continued healthy demand in many of our end markets.", "Our financial performance in fiscal 2017 demonstrates the differentiated value we can deliver as a comprehensive data storage solutions leader. With industry-leading technologies and demonstrated ability to quickly productize them, we have been able to strategically fulfill the market's growing storage requirements.", "Our flexible business model also allows us to realize differentiated financial performance in varied market conditions, giving us greater capability to navigate a range of market conditions than what our legacy companies could achieve on a standalone basis.", "In addition to our strong financial performance, our team continues to execute very well on the ramp of 3D NAND technology and on the integration of HGST, SanDisk and WD, each of which Mike and Mark will elaborate on.", "I would also like to provide a brief update on our ongoing discussions with Toshiba. Our goal has always been to protect and preserve the health and future of our successful joint ventures. We and our subsidiaries have operated the JVs with Toshiba for the last 17 years. It is a partnership that has been highly successful for both parties and for Japan. As you may have seen in media reports, Mark and I were in Japan last week to continue our dialog with Toshiba and its stakeholders. Our discussions were constructive, and we will continue to work to seek a solution that is in the best interest of all parties.", "Beyond that, we will not get into more detail on this matter until we have a material update to share with you. We know this is an important topic for the investment community and we are committed to keeping you apprised. Rest assured, this has the full attention of our team as we are committed to the continued success of the joint ventures.", "In closing, I want to thank our employees for all that we have done and accomplished over the course of the last several years. We are building a great company with a strong foundation for our future as a differentiated leader in the storage industry.", "I will now turn the call over to Mike to provide business highlights in the June quarter.", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. To build on Steve's remarks, I'm very pleased with a strong finish to our fiscal 2017. With several milestones achieved across the various areas of our business, all of our reported revenue categories grew both sequentially and year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Results from our NAND flash products were strong in the midst of a continued constrained supply environment, and HDD results were largely within our expectations. We made further progress towards our 3D NAND technology transition objectives, and our operational advancements remained on track.", "Most importantly, our results since the close of the SanDisk acquisition last year illustrate the power of our platform. Our client devices business grew by 36% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, despite the PC market being slightly weaker than expected in the quarter. This growth was driven by our progress in diversifying our customer base, and continued expansion of our product portfolio with the gains being most pronounced in mobility and client SSD.", "Combined revenue from emerging growth applications such as connected home, gaming and industrial also delivered strong sequential growth. We have begun multiple sampling activities for embedded products designed for the automotive market, a compelling long-term growth opportunity.", "In client solutions, the strength of our WD, HGST and SanDisk brands, combined with our global distribution capabilities, allowed us to deliver strong performance in what has historically been our relatively weaker period in retail. This enabled us to achieve a 14% year-over-year revenue growth in the June quarter on a pro forma basis. The ability to serve customers with the broadest array of products and solutions is a key element of our strategy.", "Turning to data center devices and solutions. Shipments of our 10 terabyte helium drives increased significantly on a sequential basis as our industry-leading product made further inroads in hyperscale data centers. The storage and efficiency requirements of data center customers are driving a sustained shift to the 10 terabyte capacity point, and we believe we further increased our market presence in this category.", "On a cumulative basis, since the launch of our helium platform four years ago, we have shipped more than 18 million helium drives. Qualification activities for our 12 terabyte helium drives began at key hyperscale and OEM customers in the June quarter. With the success of our 10 terabyte platform and our expectation to continue our generational lead with the 12 terabyte platform, we are well positioned to maintain product leadership over the next several years.", "For the nearline drive market, our expectation for the long-term industry exabyte growth at the 40% annual rate remains unchanged. Given certain industry-wide component shortages, we now estimate the industry exabyte growth to be approximately 30% for calendar 2017. However, we expect our own growth rate will be approximately 40% given the strong adoption of our nearline offerings.", "In our JV fab operations, we continued the strong ramp on our 64-layer 3D NAND BiCS3 technology during the quarter with a significant portion of our product shipments now using this industry-leading technology. Manufacturing yields of BiCS3 continue to meet our expectations, and we are maintaining our projection for the combined JV output of 64-layer 3D NAND to be the highest in the industry in calendar 2017. Development work on BiCS4, our recently -announced 96-layer 3D NAND technology, is ongoing and we expect to begin sampling in calendar 2017 with meaningful production volumes in calendar 2018.", "In addition to the solid progress on our BiCS portfolio, we are delivering innovative new technology capabilities such as the recently announced 4-bits-per-cell 3D NAND. From a future fab perspective, we intend to participate in the JV's Fab 6 to provide additional clean room space to support the further conversion of our existing 2D NAND capacity to 3D NAND. We expect production output from the new clean room facility to begin in calendar 2018.", "From a NAND industry supply standpoint, our estimate for bit growth rate for calendar 2017 remains at the low end of our long-term industry outlook of 35% to 45%, and for calendar 2018, somewhat higher than in 2017. Combined with the secular growth drivers for NAND flash, we continue to believe that the favorable NAND industry conditions will persist at least through the first half of calendar 2018.", "In closing, our strong fiscal 2017 results highlight the power of our platform. The various ingredients that make up this platform including technologies, products, go-to-market capabilities, and our team are helping us better serve our diversified customer base and manage our business to the best strategic and financial outcomes.", "I will turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussion.", "Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.", "Thank you, Mike. I'm very pleased with our financial performance in the June quarter. Our team executed well across a broad array of markets as we capitalized on our diversified product portfolio, increased gross margins and achieved cost and expense targets, all of which resulted in significant earnings growth. We also finished the fiscal year with an improved liquidity position as a result of our continued robust cash flow generation.", "Our revenue for the June quarter was $4.8 billion, driven by strong performance in each of our end markets. Revenue in data center devices and solutions was $1.4 billion, client devices was $2.4 billion, and client solutions was $1 billion. Our revenue for the June quarter was up 4% from our March quarter, and increased 21% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. All of my year-over-year comparisons cited today are on a pro forma basis.", "Our data center business continues to be fueled largely by cloud-related storage demand. Our June quarter revenue for data center devices and solutions increased 7% year-over-year. We saw a sustained strength in capacity enterprise hard drives and enterprise SSDs, offset by a decline in performance enterprise hard drives. Client devices revenue for the June quarter increased 36% year-over-year, primarily driven by significant growth in mobility and client SSDs.", "Client solutions revenue for the June quarter increased 14% year-over-year driven mostly by our valuable global retail brands in removable and other flash-based products. The execution of our strategy and strength of our broad platform enabled us to achieve 7% year-over-year total revenue growth for our full-year fiscal 2017.", "Our non-GAAP gross margin was 41.3%, up 200 basis points quarter-over-quarter and up 950 basis points year-over-year. This gross margin expansion resulted from a favorable supply-demand environment for flash-based products, product cost improvements, a higher mix of flash-based revenue, and the strength of our capacity enterprise HDD lineup.", "Turning to operating expenses. Our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $812 million. We continue to make progress toward our integration synergy targets, while also making ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities and IT projects as part of our transformation to enable future growth. Our non-GAAP interest and other expense for the June quarter was $197 million, inclusive of $201 million of interest expense. Our interest expense decreased from the previous quarter driven by the March repricings and was partially offset by the increase in LIBOR rates during the period.", "Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the June quarter was approximately 11%. On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the June quarter was $881 million or $2.93 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $280 million or $0.93 per share. The GAAP income for the period includes intangible amortization, charges-related integration activities and stock-based compensation. Therefore, the net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is primarily a result of non-cash charges.", "In the June quarter, we generated $939 million in operating cash flow, with $178 million spent on capital investments resulting in free cash flow of $761 million. We also had good working capital performance contributing to our significant operating cash flows in the quarter. We paid the previously declared cash dividend totaled $146 million during the quarter and also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share.", "We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $6.5 billion, resulting in approximately $7.5 billion of liquidity available to us, including our $1 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, our net debt has decreased approximately $2.1 billion to $6.9 billion at the end of the fiscal year, mostly driven by cash flow generated by the business. We remain committed to our long-term deleveraging plans while also assessing value-creating strategic investment opportunities as they arise.", "We remain on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar 2017. As of the end of our fiscal fourth quarter this year, we achieved approximately $350 million of cost of revenue synergies and approximately $350 million of operating expense synergies, each on an annual run rate basis. With respect to the SanDisk integration, as of the end of our fiscal fourth quarter, we have realized synergies of approximately $200 million on an annual run rate basis toward our 18-month target of achieving $500 million total run rate synergies on an annualized basis.", "I will now provide our guidance for the first quarter of 2018 on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue for our September quarter to be approximately $5.1 billion, which would represent approximately 8% year-over-year growth. We expect gross margin to be approximately 41%.", "Turning to operating expenses. We expect those to be similar to our June quarter results. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $208 million. We expect an effective tax rate in the 7% to 9% range.", "Our diluted shares are expected to be approximately $307 million, an increase from the June quarter driven mostly by a new accounting standard. As a result, we expect earnings per share between $3.25 and $3.35.", "We believe our integrated product and technology platform is a key differentiator that will enable strong long-term growth and profitability. Based on our current business outlook and capital structure, we now see the opportunity to achieve non-GAAP earnings per share that exceeds our prior guidance of $12 per share for the full calendar year 2017.", "I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's call. Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I guess I'll start off with \u2013 and I realize you guys don't break out your HDD financials in detail, but could you perhaps provide some color to help us differentiate your performance in sort of the classic Western Digital performance versus what your competitors saw in the June quarter and especially how that trends as you go forward in the nearline market, please?", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "Sure. So let me start with a bigger picture. I think for some time, we've been adjusting both our product roadmap and our product investment to try to get that optimized versus how we see the market evolving over time. That is one dimension. The other dimension is how we're working on our cost basis and our factory footprint. So we've been taking actions for some time to put ourselves in an optimal position given our broader strategy.", "But if we bring it down to some more sort of specific elements, we obviously feel very good about where we are with our 10 terabyte. We had significant quarter-over-quarter growth in terms of our output and our volume and our revenue. And we think we're in a very good position, as I stated in my prepared remarks, to continue to gain momentum through the back half of the year and that's from 10 terabyte to 12 terabyte.", "So to give you a little more color, I think one thing we've seen is the sort of top line of our hard drive business is showing more favorable flat to slightly up dimensions. And just to give you a bit of a reference point (23:53) our legacy hard drive only model, we're operating somewhere near the higher end of that model, to give you a little more flavor.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Perfect. That's extremely helpful. And I guess let me just follow up, on a broader basis when you look at the portfolio you have today with NAND and HDD and both sides seem to be doing well, is there an opportunity or are you seeing traction and able to get some revenue synergies in terms of perhaps into a enterprise customer who needs NAND, which is in tight supply, and trying to get higher allocations and drives, as well, or vice versa where you can have better NAND business and you can get more HDD market share. Is that an opportunity, is that something that you're going after right now?", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "Yeah. I think the way you should think about that is, customers see us in a very strategic fashion. It comes down to the breadth of our portfolio and their view of us as a long-term relevant partner. And so that translates to a more strategic engagement, which ultimately turns into a better commercial engagement over time.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Perfect. Thanks and congrats on the quarter, guys.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "Thanks, Amit.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question come from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Your line is now open.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group", "Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Just as a follow-up to the revenue mix, if you could give us an update on how you're tracking with the data center solution. Last December, you talked about the TAM of $23 billion by 2020, and I want to see where you are and what are the key milestones in the next 6 to 12 months, and I have a follow-up.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "It's PCS, yeah.", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "Yeah. So I think the market size opportunity, we would see, is relatively the same and unchanged. We certainly see unstructured data and object storage, as the most optimum way to pursue that is a strategically viable path. We remain committed and convicted to that. As we've also said we're in a nascent phase of our business. I think we're making good progress. You saw that we brought Phil Bullinger into the company to continue to evolve our capabilities in this area. I would say we're satisfied with progress, but it's a little too early to talk about the specifics.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group", "Okay. And then as a follow-up, just as we're trying to better assess the risk or think of the scenarios, what happens if you're not able to secure NAND wafer from the JV? What are the contingency plans?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "Well, right now, one of the things that I would emphasize, Mehdi, is that we continue to secure wafer output. We expect to continue to secure wafer output, and from a manufacturing and operations perspective, the JV remains very healthy.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group", "And what about the what-if scenario?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "I don't think that that's a reasonable scenario to be considered. I would find that to be \u2013 and I'm not sure how to characterize it, but just highly unrealistic assumption to assume that.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group", "Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is open.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions, and I have two as well. Appreciating that you guys don't split out the HDD versus the flash business, I still believe a lot of investors will look at \u2013 kind of thinking about the dynamics between the two, in particular around gross margin. And so my question is as we kind of progress \u2013 and last quarter, you talked about hitting a crossover on a cost perspective with 64 layer, how are we to think about that dynamic relative to what might be left and continued upside drivers to your flash business from a margin perspective?", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "Yeah. So let me just talk about that. Our guidance does not assume any continued upward movement in bit cost. So what we've assumed is that we're in a fairly stable period on a go-forward basis. So obviously, as we \u2013 to the extent that remains ongoing, we would expect our margins in our flash business to stay at the current level.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "Absent changes in mix and that sort of thing, or customers.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then back to kind of the synergies, I mean when you look at it, you've got still quite a decent amount of synergies to flow through the model. How are we thinking about, let's call it, that remaining $300 million of annualized synergies to be realized exiting calendar 2017 relative to the reinvestment of those synergies into the model?", "Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.", "Well, two things. First, the synergies that we're providing are \u2013 those are net synergies, with respect to what we're doing specifically for the SanDisk integration. And as you know, those synergies are both at the expense level as well as at the revenue level. So we see continued opportunity to achieve that $500 million a year run rate by the end of \u2013 it's really also the same time period, right? Eighteen months after the deal is about the end of this calendar year.", "So we feel very good about that. And as we've said, one of the areas that we've had very good success from a revenue synergy standpoint is in the ability to drive greater revenue in the client SSD space, as an example, by leveraging our strength in the client HDD market. So that's been very successful.", "Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi. Thank you. We've heard a lot from a couple of companies about lower demand levels in enterprise based on higher NAND costs and higher DRAM costs. Clearly, your business benefited from the trends to higher costs, but are you seeing lower demand? You mentioned performance was weaker, and I know you guys have been deemphasizing that. But are you seeing lower demand from customers because prices are elevated? Or are you not seeing that?", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "Yeah. So I think particularly as we think about the nearline or capacity enterprise market, as I stated, we've revised down our outlook for exabyte growth this year. The reason for that is really twofold. It is component supply shortages and then correspondingly in some instances the cost of components. So those two things are demand headwinds for us in the hyperscale market or for the industry.", "As I also stated, we think we will grow at the predicted 40% rate, and that's really based on our product portfolio and the advantage we have there. To some extent, we also would say it's a similar trend in PCs. We saw PCs being a little softer, maybe down 2%. We think the same thing is in effect there. Both cost and availability is really creating some headwinds for PC makers.", "Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. That's very helpful. And then just to follow up on the gross margin line, you guys now have been above the gross margin targets for two quarters and guiding higher for next quarter. You've got significant cost savings to come. I guess the question is, is your long-term target the right target because it seems like it should be higher or do you have the view that as things sort of level off in the NAND market that we'll go back to the prior targets in the high 30s for the gross margins? Thanks.", "Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.", "Well, you're certainly right that we've been operating above our long-term model. And I think at this point, we do feel it's a prudent model, and it does allow us to make the right investments to scale appropriately, but as we get more data and as we continue to ramp our 3D NAND technologies, we will always review the model. But at this point, we do believe that's the right range. But it's not a ceiling, and we certainly do everything we can to ensure that we're operating at the right gross margin level, so that we're ensuring that the financial model is appropriately optimized for the environment, and that's what you're seeing right now.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "So, I think Sherri, just to add a little bit of color, this is Steve. I mean we're obviously pleased and will continue to do everything that we can to operate outside our gross margin model from an upside perspective. That being said, this is a factual comment and not meant to alarm anybody, the reality is that subsequent to when we acquired SanDisk, we have been dealing with very favorable market conditions as it relates to NAND. We all know that supply and demand will even out a bit more and it'll become less of a constrained environment.", "Or historically, when that happens, is that puts a little bit more downward pressure on your margins. As we go through, call it, that sort of a cycle, we'll have a better idea of what happens in that kind of an environment. We'll use that information and then see if a revision of the margin ranges that we've indicated previously is appropriate. And believe me, as the CEO of the company, we'd be happy to raise those margin levels if we think that makes sense as we move through a bit more time.", "Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz of Barclays. Your line is open.", "Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you, and good afternoon. Continuing that thread, I just had a question, Steve or Mark. Have you guys entered into any strategic agreements with some of your bigger customers to ensure they have adequate supply of NAND? And as a result, do they have to give you volume commitments as part of those agreements? And then the follow-up question is how should we think about 2018? I think a lot of investors are quite appreciative of how you're executing and what the model has been generating. But can you still have a 40% or so gross margin from the balance of calendar 2018? Thank you.", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "Hey, Mark. This is Mike. Let me talk about the customer engagement. So I think for a number of reasons, customers have chosen to engage on a longer horizon. Some of it is technology access, some of it is supply assurance. And certainly, we are operating on a multi-quarter or, in some instances, well into 2018 basis with customers. And that's some of the reason we feel comfortable making the statement that we've made, that we believe the flash market will stay constrained through the first half of 2018. It's really the way the market and customers are prepared to engage us.", "Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.", "Right. And as it relates to financial forecast for 2018, we just haven't provided that level of granularity although, as Mike points out, we expect to have the first half of calendar 2018 benefit from the strong NAND environment, and we would expect gross margin to benefit accordingly.", "Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "Thanks, Mark.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hi. This is Atica (36:46) calling in for C.J. Can you talk a little bit more about your expected synergies from HGST and SanDisk and what still remains to be done there?", "Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.", "Sure. Well, what still remains to be done is to close the gap between what we stated as the Q4 results, so roughly the $700 million in HGST synergies on an annual run rate basis, that by the end of the year, we have a $800 million target, so we expect to close that. And as we always do, our plans are to exceed the goals. But at this point, it's the $100 million of incremental synergies that we need to close the gap to the goal.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "Which we have plans to execute on that, by the way.", "Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.", "We have plans. We're highly confident. And if you think about the COG side of the equation, we have largely reached our internal goal to hit the $800 million, and we are working to close the OpEx side of it, just to provide a little more visibility. On the Schrader side...", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "You mean SanDisk.", "Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.", "On the SanDisk side \u2013 sorry. That's our codename.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "You used the codename, just so you know.", "Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.", "On the SanDisk side, of the $300 million left to achieve the $500 million target, we're also very confident, we feel we have the plans in place and the momentum both on the revenue synergies that I talked about earlier and on the cost and more the OpEx synergies. So we feel very confident that we'll achieve the $500 million in SanDisk synergies as well.", "Unknown Speaker", "Thank you. And then for my follow-up, can you talk a little bit about your view on further reducing your debt?", "Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.", "Well, as we stated, we remain committed to our long-term deleveraging plan, and in addition to that, we will continue to review value creation opportunities as they arise. So long term, getting to the investment grade status is still our objective, and we will continue to look for the best way to deploy capital from a strategic standpoint in addition to our deleveraging.", "Unknown Speaker", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Your line is open.", "Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC", "Hey. Thanks, guys, for taking the questions, and congratulations on the strong results. Just one for me, just circling back again to the revenue synergy conversation, Steve and Mike \u2013 I think I've asked about it sort of a few quarters ago \u2013 revenue synergy potential. It seems like it's coming up as a point of topic already just a few quarters in. And so I guess my question is, without \u2013 kind of knowing you're not going to give a guide around it and then maybe you aren't even able to yet, why wouldn't \u2013 I guess asking this way, why wouldn't the revenue synergy opportunity, as you guys have described it today, not ultimately be significantly bigger than the cost synergy side of things, the $500 million?", "Just in general it would seem \u2013 not when we see this kind of combination, I just think over the years it seems like a very classic, even less strategic than this revenue synergy for companies could be at least 5% or 10% kind of revenue synergy. And the $500 million on the cost side is I think 2% of the combined company revenue. So I guess, long-winded, why wouldn't there be an opportunity longer term to amplify this to a much more significant degree, like the billions of dollars?", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "Yeah. So first of all, the $500 million mark reference is a combination of the two, and it's really timing relative to our original projections. So we would not disagree. We see revenue synergy as a very strong strategic opportunity. We're well on our pace to execute those synergies, and we see more in front of us. So I would not disagree in general with your statements. But the $500 million is a combination of the two, as well as the further out targets that we gave at the time of the acquisition.", "Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.", "Right. And just to clarify, so the end of this calendar year is where we have the $500 million annual run rate synergies for the SanDisk acquisition. And then in 2020 we have $1.1 billion of total synergies. So you're right, we continue to drive all the different synergies, the cost synergies, the OpEx synergies, as well as the revenue synergies...", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "Right.", "Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.", "...for the long term.", "Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC", "Appreciate the clarification. And just a quick follow-up, same topic. Where are you guys just in the process of engaging clients, holistically, enterprise clients and CSPs holistically with the portfolio? Where are you mechanically with that process, as in when do you think you'll sort of have that process complete?", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "So it depends on the particular CSP. Some of them were more advanced than others, and it really depends on their product requirements. As we've stated, our enterprise SSD portfolio, although we have some competitive products, is not all that we would expect it to be. That portfolio gets stronger in 2018, which will further enable that process. So that remains sort of a forward-looking positive lever for us as we engage, but we are well underway mechanically with all of them. It's really in some instances where we don't have all the product fits that we need.", "Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC", "Got it. Really helpful. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho. Your line is open.", "Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Just a couple of questions on the NAND side. How is the 64 layer progressing and what do you expect bit growth on the SanDisk side? And do you see any scenario where you could be blocked, or your supply of NAND could be blocked under any scenarios?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "Yeah. So I'll talk about that. We're making very good strong progress on 64-layer BiCS3 technology, and our yields are very strong, so it's consistent with Mike's prepared remarks. We're really pleased with the progress that we're making on BiCS3 as well as frankly the progress that we're making on our next generation, the 96-layer BiCS4. So very pleased and hats off to the team in terms of the progress that's being made.", "In terms of bit growth, we have indicated that the industry growth will be towards the lower end of our longer-term expectation of 35% to 45% and that's for calendar 2017. And we would anticipate that our specific bit growth will be a little bit higher than that. So we'll be slightly exceeding on the industry growth rate. And then, your comment or question with regards to, I guess, being cut off from a NAND supply perspective. It's similar to the question that we had earlier and that is a very unlikely scenario.", "Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Got it. On the hard disk side, 10 terabyte, you guys have done very well, especially last quarter. Do you think there is a sustainable moat there where you can sustain that market share on your 10 terabyte and 12 terabyte going forward? Thanks.", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "Yes, we do. So I think it begins with the helium platform maturity. It's a complex technology to get right, to deliver reliable product in the field, to ramp at high-volume, and that's just the base. We also have a pipeline of other technologies that we think are well-situated to allow us to continue to maintain and protect that lead. So we feel very good about the 10 terabyte, we feel good about the 12 terabyte, and frankly speaking, we feel good about products after that.", "Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Miller of The Benchmark Company. Your line is open.", "Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC", "Following up on the last question where you believe you'll sustain your leadership in the 10 terabyte and 12 terabyte helium drives, your competitor has kind of led in the shingled media. Do you see yourself pulling closer to them over the next year?", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "Yeah. So I think relative to SMR technology, it's about, from our standpoint, when we deploy that and to what market. I would acknowledge that our competitor went earlier in client and they had a lead on us. We're in the process of closing that. But our strategy has been from the beginning, deploy the technology where most value could be obtained from it and we see that happening frankly speaking at 14 terabytes and beyond and we'll be quite competitive at that point.", "Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC", "And you said the flash demand supply won't come back into balance until the middle of next year. Do you have any ways \u2013 or do you believe there was any double ordering in the marketplaces?", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "So there is always some of that in the world, but obviously, I referenced our engagement with customers and our ability to construct agreements with them that gives us confidence about our position into the first half of 2018. And normally customers, if they believe the supply circumstances would be different, they would not entertain such agreements. So it's an affirming point of view to our general market expectation.", "Mark Miller - The Benchmark Co. LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. I just wanted to start off, you made the comments about Fab 6 and availability of output next year. We thought that in some of the filings you guys had made you'd said that negotiations over Fab 6 and Fab 7 had stopped. So I wonder, have things progressed on that front? I mean is that \u2013 have there been developments since the filings on the positive on that? Could you just kind of update us on that? And then I have a follow-up.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "Sure, Rod. And as \u2013 well, as I've said in my prepared remarks, we remain in constructive dialog with Toshiba and our stakeholders in Japan and that includes conversations with regards to Fab 6.", "Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And just, I guess I'll follow up on the same question. And the thing is, Steve, you guys filed in core documents that negotiations had stopped and now you have a high level of confidence that output's coming in 2018. So it sounds like you're pretty confident on the situation there. So I just wonder, has there been positive development in terms of the discussion or is there no development, no change from the core documents I guess is the question?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "Yeah, Rod. In all honesty, I am not familiar with the details of all the particular filings that you're referring to, so I can't comment on that specific filing. Recognize that the discussions and various things that have been going on with Toshiba, there's been a lot of back and forth, and it's been a difficult situation for all of us including for Toshiba. And rather than talking about the history in terms of the back and forth that's occurred, I can assure you and our shareholders that last week and ongoing we're having discussions with Toshiba regarding Fab 6 and the discussions are constructive.", "Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. That's great. I appreciate that, Steve. And then I just \u2013 could you comment a little bit about the hard drive market expectations you have as we look into September? Do you guys expect the TAM to grow into September? Could you give us any idea, kind of color on what you think the overall market is going to look like?", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "Yeah. So just a little more color to my earlier comments around both hyperscale and PC. We would expect there will be some seasonal \u2013 normal seasonal growth in the back half, but both of those will be muted somewhat by those factors I talked about. We had previously been looking at about a flat PC market for the year. We now are projecting or planning for down about 2%, and then we also gave color or revision down on industry exabytes deployed in capacity enterprise, which we think will be around 30% which is down from the originally planned for 40%.", "Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "Sure.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "So we want to thank everybody for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you going forward.

Welcome to the Western Digital's First Quarter Fiscal 2018 Conference Call. Presently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "I would now turn the call over to Bob Blair. You may begin.", "Robert Blair - Western Digital Corp.", "Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This call will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements concerning our expected future financial performance, our market positioning, expectations regarding growth opportunities, our financial and business strategies and execution, our acquisitions, integration activities, and achievement of synergy goals; demand and market trends, our product portfolio, product development efforts and expansion into new data storage markets, deleveraging plans, our joint ventures with Toshiba and the outcome of related legal proceedings, investments in Fab 6, and supply of NAND flash memory.", "These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including those listed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on August 29, 2017.

Reconciliations of the differences between the non-GAAP measures we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures will be posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. We have not fully reconciled our non-GAAP financial measures guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, because material items that impact these measures are not in our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort.", "In the question-and-answer part of today's call, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question to allow as many callers as possible to ask their question. I thank you in advance for your cooperation.", "And now, I will turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Steve Milligan.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating officer; and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal first quarter and wrap up with our guidance. We will then take your questions.", "We reported continued strong financial performance in the September quarter, demonstrating the power of our platform and underscoring the differentiated value we can deliver, as a comprehensive data storage solutions leader.", "For the September quarter, we reported revenue of $5.2 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 42%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.56. We generated strong operating cash flow, reflecting continued healthy demand in our end markets, most notably in our flash-based businesses. With unabated growth in data creation leading to new challenges and opportunities for our customers, our transformation continues to resonate in the marketplace.", "I would now like to spend a few minutes reviewing where we are with Toshiba. There has been significant media coverage around this situation, and a lot of it is speculative. So, as a starting point, I want to emphasize that the JVs continue to operate efficiently and productively, which we intend to maintain. The JVs benefit from the best talent in the industry, and we are deeply appreciative of the professionalism, focus and dedication exhibited by the teams from Toshiba and SanDisk.", "From the beginning, our number one priority has been ensuring the longevity and continued success of the joint ventures. That is why we have invested so much time and energy into finding a resolution, one that respects our partnership, and resolves this matter so we can move forward in the spirit of collaboration and innovation that has been the hallmark of this 17-year relationship.", "Throughout the course of the negotiations, we made numerous allowances to meet the needs of Toshiba and other stakeholders, such as lenders, customers, suppliers and government agencies. Most notably, we withdrew from the INCJ-KKR consortium. This eliminated our participation in TMC equity ownership, thus minimizing regulatory risk and directly addressing key concerns of TMC's management.", "It also would have meant that TMC would remain under full control of Japanese stakeholders. While we believe we provided the best potential solution to Toshiba and their stakeholders, Toshiba announced the transaction with the consortium led by SK Hynix and Bain Capital. We have made our concerns regarding their consortium clear. It continues to be our position that the transaction is not permitted without our consent. That leads to where we are today.", "There are two potential paths for resolution. The stakeholders will either engage in constructive dialogue in the near future, or this matter will be resolved through the objective arbitration process. With respect to arbitration, we are moving forward with strong momentum, following our successful track record in the California courts. On October 5, the International Court of Arbitration confirmed the three-member arbitration panel. Shortly thereafter, we informed the panel of our intention to seek injunctive relief to prevent Toshiba from transferring its JV interests to SK Hynix-Bain consortium without SanDisk's consent. The panel will set a hearing schedule soon, at which point, we will officially file our motion.", "SanDisk consent rights are clear and explicit, and we therefore feel confident in our request for injunctive relief. We expect a ruling in the first part of 2018 in advance of Toshiba's announced timeframe to close the proposed transaction. Just to be clear, we do not undertake litigation lightly. We are not litigious. And it should only be a last resort, especially in the context of this joint venture relationship.", "With respect to Fab 6, you may recall that, over the summer, during negotiations for the first investment tranche, Toshiba announced that it would unilaterally invest in Fab 6. This was a surprise to us. In fact, when Toshiba made its announcement, we had more meetings scheduled to further discuss our joint investment.", "This was the first time that SanDisk was prevented from participating in a new fab investment. To remind you, Toshiba's actions, associated with the first tranche, are already the subject of arbitration. The negotiations regarding the second investment tranche for Fab 6 are ongoing. Just as we did during the negotiations for the first investment tranche, we intend to jointly participate in the investment, and we are agreeing to all good-faith commercially reasonable terms proposed by Toshiba. However, we will not agree to terms such as SanDisk unilaterally waiving or negating its consent rights as a condition to participate, which is what Toshiba has proposed. Consequently, at this time, we are not confident that an agreement will be reached on this next investment tranche either.", "As we have noted, Toshiba's planned initial investment in Fab 6 is solely for its directly-owned capacity that is outside of the JVs. If Toshiba proceeds unilaterally with the second investment tranche, it would also be for Toshiba's directly-owned capacity, not joint venture capacity. It is also important to remember that the JVs are obligated to provide us our entitled share of flash supply through 2029. Based on the JV agreements, we remain confident in our planned supply bit growth rate of 35% to 45% for calendar 2018 and calendar 2019, irrespective of these initial investments in Fab 6.", "In closing, I want to emphasize the following; first, our board and management are focused on resolving our differences with Toshiba, whether that is through a negotiated agreement or the arbitration process. Second, we are steadfast in our commitment to protect our interests and those of Western Digital's stakeholders. We are confident in our fact-based legal positions and our right to injunctive relief.", "Third, as I mentioned earlier, there has been a great deal of misinformation provided into the marketplace through various channels. We expect this activity to persist, contributing to potential confusion about this situation and our legal rights. Western Digital will continue to communicate consistently and transparently, as we did with the recently filed FAQ, and through public forums like this call.", "And finally, I want to reiterate that our number one priority has been to ensure the longevity and continued success of the joint ventures. From day one, we have not changed this priority or our commitment to acting in the best interest of our stakeholders.", "I also want to thank the outstanding Western Digital team. You have maintained your focus and continued innovating and delivering for our customers in spectacular fashion.", "With that, I will ask Mike and Mark to share the highlights of our quarter.", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. Our September quarter results were better than expected, with demand for our products remaining strong. The joint venture fab operations in Yokkaichi continued as planned, and we made further progress in the ongoing conversion to 3D NAND technologies.", "In Client Devices, revenue grew nicely from the year-ago quarter, driven by increased demand for our embedded flash products and client SSDs. Our embedded flash products, such as iNAND, gained further adoption within the mobile OEM ecosystem, and our design win pipeline for these solutions deepened further for both current and emerging growth applications.", "Demand for our client SSDs grew due to increased adoption within our OEMs' product portfolios, coinciding with the expansion of our product offering. We began ramping our 64-layer based client SSDs for OEMs in the September quarter. And in the December quarter, we expect to launch our 64-layer eMMC solutions for the mobile and compute markets.", "Our Client Solutions revenue grew strongly from the prior year, driven by the diversity of our portfolio of HDD and flash-based products. During the quarter, we launched two new mobile lifestyle products, iXpand Base and My Cloud Home, as well as the world's highest-capacity microSD card at 400 gigabytes. The strength and appeal of our retail brands, along with a broadening product portfolio, is enabling us to continue to deliver differentiated value to the global consumer marketplace.", "In Data Center Devices and Solutions, our September quarter revenue was similar to the year-ago quarter, as combined revenue growth in enterprise SSDs and capacity enterprise hard drives was offset by the expected secular decline in performance enterprise hard drives.", "In capacity enterprise, as we previously commented, demand continues to be muted due to the ongoing industry-wide shortage of key components, principally DRAM, resulting in slower industry petabyte growth in calendar 2017. As we look into calendar 2018, which is increasingly informed by our joint planning with hyperscale customers, we expect the petabyte growth with reaccelerate to the 40% annual rate. This will be driven by planned market migration to higher capacities such as our 12-terabyte offering to handle the growth of varied workloads, and as the component shortages ease.", "In the September quarter, we saw a continued shift in capacity enterprise to 10-terabyte drives, gaining further traction with our third-generation helium offering. Customer qualification activities in our fourth-generation helium offering, our 12-terabyte drive, remained on track and we expect its commercial ramp will accelerate in the December quarter.", "We are pleased to note that we have shipped more than 20 million helium drives since our introduction of this platform in 2012. Just over two weeks ago, we hosted a very successful technology event to formally announce important breakthroughs we have achieved to make microwave-assisted magnetic recording, also known as MAMR, a commercial reality. We have been the leader in capacity enterprise with innovative solutions, the most recent being HelioSeal technology. The commercial availability of MAMR technology is a significant next step in maintaining this leadership. MAMR substantially leverages past investments in perpendicular magnetic recording technology, making the justification for choosing this next-generation drive technology even more compelling.", "Further, an additional advantage of MAMR is that it requires almost no ecosystem changes in both our internal manufacturing processes or in customer infrastructure. As we have previously stated, we are planning to take MAMR into production in calendar 2019. We believe the areal density advantages that MAMR can deliver will enable us to provide helium drives at 40 terabytes and higher capacities for this growing market in years ahead.", "In the September quarter, we completed the acquisition of Tegile Systems, a leading provider of flash storage systems for the enterprise data center applications. With Tegile's IntelliFlash products focusing on fast data and our active scale products addressing big data, the combined company is in a stronger position to fully address diverse customer workloads. The Tegile acquisition will also enable us to accelerate our efforts to move up the stack, provide increasingly differentiated value for our customers.", "In our flash joint ventures, during the September quarter, we achieved bit output crossover for 3D NAND versus 2D NAND. Manufacturing yields of BiCS3, our 64-layer 3D NAND, continued to improve and we met our ramp objectives of this industry-leading technology. We are also pleased to report that our entire retail portfolio has been enabled on BiCS3 already, and we are well underway in expanding the uses of this technology into our OEM offerings, positioning us to deliver the industry's richest mix of 64-layer base products in calendar 2017.", "From a flash industry standpoint, our estimate for bit growth for calendar 2017 remains at the low end of our long-term industry outlook of 35% to 45%. For calendar 2018, we expect overall industry bit growth to continue to be in that long-term range. Given that the secular growth drivers for flash remain strong, we continue to believe that the favorable industry conditions will persist through the first half of calendar 2018. Furthermore, as we previously indicated, our bit supply requirements for calendar 2018 are secure, and we are confident based on the JV agreements and our ability to achieve bit growth in calendar 2019 within our long-term range.", "In closing, our strong September quarter results continue to demonstrate the power of our platform. The various ingredients that make up this platform, including technologies, products, go-to-market capabilities and our team, are helping us better serve our diversified customer base and manage our business to the best strategic and financial outcomes. The combination of our strong competitive position with our capacity enterprise helium drives and the continued ramp of our BiCS3 products should provide a solid base to drive year-over-year revenue growth in our current fiscal year.", "I will now turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussion.", "Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.", "Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased with our financial performance in the September quarter. Our team executed well across our broad array of markets, as we capitalized on our diversified product portfolio, increased gross margins and achieved cost and expense targets, all of which resulted in significant earnings growth. We also finished the September quarter with an improved liquidity position as a result of our continued robust cash flow generation.", "It is important to note that our fiscal 2017 financial performance included SanDisk's operating results for the full fiscal year. So any year-over-year comparisons I reference today will be a direct comparison. Our revenue for the September quarter was $5.2 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in each of our end markets.", "Revenue in Data Center Devices and Solutions was $1.4 billion; Client Devices was $2.7 billion; and Client Solutions was $1.1 billion. Our data center business continues to be fueled largely by cloud-related storage demand. Our September quarter revenue for Data Center Devices and Solutions was flat year-over-year. We saw sustained strength from capacity enterprise hard drives and enterprise SSDs, offset by an expected decline in performance enterprise hard drives.", "Client Devices revenue for the September quarter increased 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by significant growth in mobility and client SSDs. Client Solutions revenue for the September quarter increased 16% year-over-year, mostly as a result of the strength of our valuable global retail brands in removable and other flash-based products.", "Our non-GAAP gross margin was 42.3%, up 840 basis points year-over-year. This gross margin expansion resulted from a favorable supply/demand environment for flash-based products, product cost improvements, a higher mix of flash-based revenue and the strength of our capacity enterprise HDD lineup.", "Turning to operating expense, our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $819 million. This included ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities, IT transformation projects and operating expenses related to our recently-acquired companies. We continue to make progress toward our integration synergy targets, while also making investments in our future capabilities.", "Or non-GAAP interest and other expense for the September quarter was $200 million, inclusive of $205 million of interest expense. Our interest expense decreased $31 million year-over-year, primarily from the repricing savings, which were partially offset by LIBOR increases. Or non-GAAP effective tax rate for the September quarter was approximately 7%.", "On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the September quarter was $1.1 billion or $3.56 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $681 million or $2.23 per share. The GAAP income for the period includes intangible amortization, charges related to integration activities and stock-based compensation. Therefore, the net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP net income is primarily a result of non-cash charges.", "In the September quarter, we generated $1.1 billion in operating cash flow, an increase of 158% year-over-year. We continue to reinvest in our businesses with $286 million spent on capital investments, resulting in free cash flow of $847 million. We also had good working capital performance contributing to our significant operating cash flows in the quarter. We paid the previously-declared cash dividend totaling $147 million during the quarter, and also declared a dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share.", "We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $7 billion, resulting in approximately $8 billion of liquidity available to us, including our $1 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, our net debt has decreased approximately $600 million to $6.3 billion at the end of the September quarter, mostly driven by cash flow generated by the business. We remain committed to our deleveraging plans, and will continue to optimize our cost of capital and capital structure, while retaining sufficient liquidity and flexibility.", "We remain on track to achieve our planned synergy targets from both the HGST and SanDisk integrations in the time commitments we previously established. The combined savings of the programs have contributed to our strong financial results and validated our strategy for the acquisitions.", "I will now provide our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue to be between $5.2 billion and $5.3 billion. We expect gross margin to be slightly higher than the prior quarter. Turning to operating expenses, we expect those to be approximately $830 million. Interest and other expense is expected to be approximately $205 million.", "We expect an effective tax rate in the 6% to 8% range. Our diluted shares are expected to be approximately 309 million. As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $3.60 and $3.70, resulting in EPS for the calendar year 2017 of approximately $12.50.", "We believe our integrated product and technology platform is a key differentiator that will enable strong, long-term growth and profitability. While we expect to see our normal seasonal decline in the second half of fiscal 2018, we see the opportunity to achieve revenue growth at the high end of our long-term model of 4% to 8% for fiscal 2018. Also, based on our current business outlook and capital structure, we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share will be approximately $13 for fiscal 2018.", "I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. I appreciate the details related to Toshiba. My only question here is really around the guidance here for 2018. Can you give us a sense here in terms of how you expect the mix of SSD versus HDD to play out? Will there be any sort of outsized change there? And do you actually get a benefit as NAND pricing does come down? Do you actually see the potential for pent-up demand for more NAND-based or SSD-based products for WD? Thank you.", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "So, Mark, let me give you some color on that. So, I think as we see ourselves progressing through this fiscal year, we feel fully comfortable with placement of our bit output in the various market segments. So, the demand is there sufficient to consume our bit output. Relative to the mix and penetration of SSD, I think that is somewhat slowed based upon NAND constraints at an industry basis. We would expect though the long-term penetration to kind of continue as planned, nothing sort of untoward.", "Robert Blair - Western Digital Corp.", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I guess the first question maybe to start with, on the Toshiba dynamic, if they do go forward with the transaction that they've proposed, I'm curious, and you don't need to give me the exact details, but do you think you have a viable plan B, C and D to secure bit capacity beyond the calendar 2019 you've talked about?", "And broadly, the cross-licensing agreement you guys both have mentioned, the SanDisk IP, does that apply for Toshiba, even if they decide to ramp up production unilaterally without Western Digital? Or does that cross-licensing only get held up while it's done together?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "Yeah. Amit, this is Steve. I'll take the second question first. I would prefer not to comment on that in terms of how the technology licensing arrangements work. And then the second thing is, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, the joint venture agreements require bit output to be provided to us over a period of time, out to 2029.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Got it. I guess if I could just maybe follow up on one thing, Intel, on their call, is just talking about signing a long-term NAND agreement and getting $2 billion of prepayment for that in 2017 and 2018. I'm curious, given the fact that NAND demand keeps outpacing the supply based on even what you guys are talking about, is there a potential for you guys to enter into strategic agreements with some of your bigger customers? And are you perhaps already doing that?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "Yes. I think those sort of long-term arrangements are can be part of our ongoing practice. So, yes, we do those sorts of things, and from time-to-time, prepayments would be one of the elements of those agreements.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Perfect. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is the open.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group", "Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Two follow-ups. In terms of NAND availability, how are you dealing with allocation? Right now, we are going through ramp-up by some of the smartphone OEM customers that you have. And, in that context, given the tightness, how should we think about allocation mix between enterprise SSD and embedded application? Do any of these customers have a long-term agreement, which would require you to fulfill? Or should we think about economics of each driving the allocation? And I have a follow-up.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "Yes. So, our allocation philosophy has two dimensions. Obviously, one of them you referenced, which is economic. The other is strategic. So we're looking at our goals of, sort of, optimizing between our current and mid-term financial results and our long-term objectives of growing and diversifying our customer base across multiple product segments. So, it's a complex formula, and it really is based on those two things. Obviously, based upon our results, we are growing in basically all of those segments and you can see the results of some of that activity.", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "Yes. And I think just to add to that, the diversity from a market, product, and customer perspective that we have, oh, by the way, is by design. And the other thing is that, it allows us \u2013 it provides more resilience from a financial perspective to our model. So I think that diversification concept is something that is very central to the way that we run and manage the business.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group", "Got it. And then looking longer term, especially with the nearline and higher density products, when should we expect MAMR samples to be out there? And I'm assuming that both HAMR and MAMR products are going to be out there. And for us from outside, we're trying to figure out when is the earliest that we could look into the market and figure out the differences and the cost benefit for each technology?", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "So, we said in our announcement that we would have samples out late in 2018 and production in 2019, which I just commented on. Relative to sort of our reasons for picking it, I stated in my comments obviously our view is the economic or commercial competitiveness of the technology made it a pretty obvious choice for us. Obviously, we needed to get some technology breakthroughs to get confident around our ability to achieve the areal density results required, but once that was done, it was a clear choice for us. One of the things I will point you to is really our internal manufacturing processes, and the ability for us to leverage the current perpendicular or PMR based manufacturing technologies and tooling we have in place.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group", "So, by late 2018, we should see field data that would help us compare the difference between the two?", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "No, we will ship customer samples in 2018, we will ramp production in 2019.", "Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Rob Cihra with Guggenheim. Your line is open.", "Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Hi. Great. Thanks very much. Mike, you talked about the high-cap capacity growth reaccelerating or picking back up in 2018, after being muted in part by DRAM in 2017. I mean, is that just a sort of a DRAM availability thing? Or is there also an indication in terms of you talking to customers, cloud builders, service providers? I mean are you seeing their demand looking better irrespective of component availability? Thanks.", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "Yeah. Let me back up a little bit. I think the demand has been there all along, right? So, what's happening in 2017 is not a reflection of the true demand environment, it's certainly been muted by external or temporary factors. And yes, our view of 2018 is based upon close planning work with our customer base both in hyperscale and outside of that.", "Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "And do you find from your OEM customers \u2013 I mean are they more traditional OEMs? Are they taking enough high cap to offset declines in mission critical? Or is it really just now at this stage, it depends on what the cloud service guys do? Thanks.", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "Well, yeah, so for us certainly the big consumers of capacity enterprise are the cloud providers, or hyperscalers. But the traditional storage OEMs still buy at a substantial rate relative to its impact on performance enterprise hard drives, it's really not capacity enterprise eroding that, it's SSD's and the new architectures and better cost performance you can get, displacing a new system design and new architectures that performance tier with flash based products.", "Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.", "Aaron Christopher Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities", "Thank you. Just curious, as you roll up your forecast for fiscal 2018 \u2013 I'm sorry, looking into calendar 2018 I should say, I'm just curious what assumptions \u2013 I know you talked about long-term supply growth in that 35% to 45% range. What assumption are you making in terms of your own capacity, ability to supply capacity growth? And in that context, what are you assuming as far as your cost, the price erosion and your ability to take cost down as you ramp 3D 64-layer and beyond?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "Yeah. Mike can take the first part, and then Mark can take the second part.", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "Yeah. Aaron, we talk about our expectation for bit growth rate, which is 35% to 45%. We would expect we will be growing in that same range, and we expect to be able to maintain the expected cost reductions that we've talked about, which are in that longer-range models 15% to 25%, as we continue to convert from 2D to 3D, it's sort of at the 15% to 20% at an industry level.", "Aaron Christopher Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. And kind of in that same context, as you look at the overall industry supply/demand dynamics, I know you talked about more or less a reiteration of favorable trends through the first half of the year, have you seen any indications at all, either positive or negative, as far as that potential even extending further or shortening?", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "Yes, I think at this point it's really too early to tell. Certainly, we don't have any indication strongly to one side or the other, at this point.", "Aaron Christopher Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yes. Thank you. Steve, it sounds like you're pretty confident in supply here in 2018, 2019 and beyond, but can you give us some sense of confidence that these JVs will keep up with future NAND development, so future output as the technology sort of progresses? And will you still have the supply, if arbitration proceedings potentially go against you? And I have a follow-up.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "Yeah, it's in both of our best interest that we continue to advance the capabilities of the joint ventures from a technology and from a manufacturing perspective. And so, we're confident that ourselves and our joint venture partner will continue to invest appropriately in that capability going forward. And that's independent, frankly speaking, of how the arbitration proceedings turn out.", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks, Steve. And can you comment on expectation sort of NAND pricing? How much was that up relative to your expectations of flat in September quarter? And what is sort of embedded in expectations in your December quarter guide? Thank you.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "I think we talked about last quarter that ASPs had flattened. That was our expectation coming into this quarter, and that's really our expectation as we sit today. So we don't see continued movement in a substantial way up, but it's being sustained at the current level.", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joe Wittine with Longbow Research. Your line is now open.", "Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC", "Hey. Thanks. Great quarter, and thanks for the discussion on the JV. Just one for Mark, on gross margin over the midterm, so obviously you expect supply demand fundamentals in NAND to stay favorable through the first half. Can you just address and even qualitatively, how you expect the GM line to trend after that point? And I ask mostly because the Street is still north of 40%, which is obviously solidly above the high end of your range. So any forward-looking GM commentary would be helpful.", "Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.", "Sure. And I think, certainly, as we look more near term, we are getting some benefit from the ramp of our BiCS3 technology, so that will give us some gross margin benefit, and that will continue into the first part of calendar 2018, which is a positive margin benefit. As we look out through and into 2018, that is our seasonally slower period in the first half for HDD, so we're going to have some offsetting declines in gross margin there. And I think net-net, we would expect still healthy gross margin through the rest of the fiscal year, but we wouldn't expect it to continue at the exact same level due to those seasonal factors and the mix with HDD.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen. Your line is now open.", "Karl Ackerman - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to circle back on the NAND technology roadmap questions that were addressed earlier today. I understand that the Bain-led consortium must fulfill your supply agreements in place through 2029, but do the master agreements stipulate that Toshiba and the Bain-led consortium must invest in 3D NAND technology for your existing fabs? Because if not, it would appear that your lack of a supply agreement with Fab 6 today, where I think the current plan is to build 96 layer 3D NAND, limits your technology roadmap beyond the 3D NAND tools that are installed in Fab 3, Fab 4 and Fab 5 today? Thank you.", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "As I indicated, we provided a lot of details in terms of my prepared remarks in addition to the 8-K. And as I noted, that our number one priority is the continued longevity and success of the joint venture, and some of the details that you're asking, I'd prefer not to get lost in the weeds in terms of some of those questions at this point.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.", "Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. When do you see data center solutions returning to growth? Could that happened as early as the calendar first quarter? And then, maybe, Mark, can you comment on where you see OpEx levels exiting the fiscal year?", "Mark P. Long - Western Digital Corp.", "Sure. I will take the OpEx question, and then Mike can talk about the Data Center Devices and Solutions. In terms of OpEx, one of the things we should keep in mind is that we tend to have, or we annually have, a small spike in calendar Q1 that has to do with the reset of payroll taxes. So we would otherwise expect OpEx to be relatively consistent through the rest of the fiscal year, other than this slight increase in calendar Q1.", "And I think the key point is we will be exiting the year roughly in a position that's consistent with our long-term model, plus or minus, and I think we're currently operating within our long-term model much earlier than we had anticipated. The long-term model being 14% to 16% of revenue. And so I think our continued efficiencies that we're gaining from our achieving the synergy targets and from other transformational projects that we have ongoing should allow us to continue operating in a healthy range consistent with our long-term model.", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "Relative to the Data Center Devices and Systems \u2013 or Solutions growth, I think two things, two factors, I talked about Exabyte (44:58) growth rate relative to capacity enterprise expected to reaccelerate as well as our continued and planned progress around enterprise SSD product offerings puts us in a good position, as we progress through 2018 calendar year to have growth as we go.", "Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Your line is now open.", "Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Hi, guys. Just on the hard disk drive side, I was wondering if you could give us some color on 10-terabyte, how it grew sequentially and how do you see the December quarter and looking out.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "Yeah, the color we'll give you is we did see significant quarter-to-quarter growth on 10 terabytes. We also saw the initial ramp on 12 terabytes, and we would expect that will accelerate into the current quarter. So, the continued movements of the market to the highest capacities in this case 10 terabytes and 12 terabytes is progressing very well. And we're very pleased with how that's moving in our business.", "Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Got it. And on the NAND side, when you look at the 64-layer NAND, where do you expect the mix of 64-layer by bit exiting this year? And let's say middle of next year, how do you see that? And with the Toshiba spat going on, do you see any disruption in that 64-layer ramp? Thanks.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "I don't think we provided any numbers for calendar 2018 at this point. But we are getting more fixed re-output (46:38) than the 2D NAND at this point, so we've realized that crossover point. And we've seen no impact of the situation with Toshiba that's changed that. No disruption to what our expectations and plans were previously, and we do not expect that into calendar 2018 either.", "Robert Blair - Western Digital Corp.", "We'll wrap up with this next questioner. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Stanley Kovler with Citi Research. Your line is now open.", "Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Thanks very much. I just wanted to continue the discussion about the outlook. As we think about the beginning of next year, clearly the PC market has held up a little bit better this year. What's your thinking about the first half of the year? You mentioned some seasonality in your business, is that the area where we should see the most seasonality? And implicitly with gross margins staying in that low 40% range, the seasonality in the first half, presumably when volumes return into maybe the second half of 2018, does that imply that we get some strength back in margins as well? Thanks very much.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "Yes, I think your perspective \u2013 one of the drivers for seasonality is PC, so, yes, you're on it. Also the consumer segments of our business also see a seasonal trends, that would include gaming, as an example. And yes, obviously, when we move into the second half of the calendar year, we do see some absorption benefits that help us on the margin.", "Michael D. Cordano - Western Digital Corp.", "Yeah. From an HDD standpoint, we'll see that. And then for the remainder of the calendar year, the flash margins will depend on the supply/demand environment.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "All right. So you've got a follow-up question quickly, please? I think we're done. Okay.", "Stephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.", "All right. I want to thank, everybody, for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you going forward. Have a great rest of the day.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

With me today are Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating officer; and Mark Long, Chief Financial Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide a summary of recent business highlights, and Mark will cover the fiscal first quarter and wrap up with our guidance. We will then take your questions.", "We demonstrated the power of our platform with record non-GAAP financial results in the December quarter. I am very pleased that we achieved a year-over-year revenue growth in each of our end market categories. We reported revenue of $5.3 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 43% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.95. We once again generated strong operating cash flow reflecting continued healthy demand in our end markets most notably for capacity enterprise hard drives and flash-based products.", "Entering the new calendar year, there are several noteworthy trends as we pursue our long-term value creation strategy. The global economic environment is healthy; the GDP growth rates in the U.S., China and the EU are positive, portending significant IT spending. Data has been created at a record pace worldwide and the value of data is increasing too driven by advancements in mobility, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things. The unabated growth in data is creating a global need for a larger and more capable storage infrastructure.", "The level of CapEx spending by cloud service providers to accommodate this growth is robust. As Michael addressed in more detail, the healthy pace of data center build out has resulted in a recent reacceleration of demand for a high capacity enterprise hard drives. Against this backdrop, we are well positioned with our powerful platform to enable our broad customer base to capture, preserve, access and transform an ever increasing diversity of data. The flash market is normalizing in a constructed manner as a diversified value-added storage solution provider with a wide breadth of serve markets; we will continue to demonstrate resilience of our model by delivering compelling financial results.", "I am very pleased with our progress in technology and product development. The deployment of our 64-layer 3D NAND technology continued across our product portfolio and we will be ramping our 96-layers technology later this calendar year. We continue to lead the industry with our high capacity helium platform and we remained on plan to sample our MAMR-based capacity enterprise hard drives in the second half of calendar 2018.", "It was gratifying at the end of the calendar year with a resolution of our negotiations with our JV partner Toshiba to extend and strengthen our relationship and ensure our long-term access to flash and I am happy to report that our JV operations continue to perform very well. I am very proud of our team driving and focus on execution and the results they have delivered.", "With that, I will ask Mike to share the business highlights.", "Mike Cordano", "Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased that we finished calendar 2017 with strong December quarter results. We executed well across our business with continued strength and demand for our products and solutions. As Steve indicated, we saw year-over-year growth in each of our end market categories, reflecting our power of our platform and addressing a broadening set of markets and customers.", "In Client Devices, revenue grew nicely from the year-ago quarter, driven most notably by demand for our embedded flash and client SSD products. We began shipments of our 3D flash-based embedded solutions with a mobile and compute market including our first USF offering allowing us to address our broader market opportunity beginning this calendar year. In addition, we saw continued strong demand for our products and growth areas, such as connected home, surveillance and industrial verticals.", "Solid year-over-year revenue increases in Client Solutions highlighted the continued preference for our G-tech, SanDisk and WD brands during the strong holiday season. We made further end roads in our engagement with leading brick-and-mortar and e-tail partners during the December quarter. At CES earlier this month, our products received half a dozen awards, underscoring the ongoing innovation and differentiated value we are delivering to this market.", "In Data Center Devices and Solutions, demand for capacity enterprise drives remains strong. Shipments of our 10 terabyte helium drives grew further and the transition to the 12 terabyte capacity point accelerated. We also began shipments of our industry leading 14 terabyte drives, for hyperscale applications during the December quarter.", "In terms of exabyte growth in capacity enterprise, as previously indicated, calendar 2017 was the slower period for the market, primarily due to industry-wide component constraints, with an overall exabyte growth rate of slightly less than 30%. However, as we noted in our December conference call, we saw strengthening demand for capacity enterprise drives, as we ended 2017.", "In the first half of calendar 2018, we estimated that the year-over-year industry exabyte growth rate will exceed 60% as the pent-up demand is fulfilled. For the full calendar 2018, we estimate exabyte growth to exceed 50%, as broad deployments of capacity enterprise drives are expected to persist throughout the year.", "Data center build out by several large hyperscale customers and guided industrial policies are driving significant global infrastructure expansion. These trends are leading to a growing need for capacity enterprise drives in the high end as well as the mid range. Western Digital, the mid range part of the capacity enterprise market has been an area of lower exabyte share.", "We have responded to the rising demand for 4 terabyte to 5 terabyte capacity drives, especially in Asia, with our recent introduction of a new range of cost-advantages, air based products. We expect the demand for high and mid range capacity drive to support the higher rate of exabyte consumption in calendar 2018, and our long-term annual exabyte growth estimate is unchanged at 40%.", "From an operational standpoint, we expect to achieve further cost and expense reductions, as the hard drive market continues to evolve. For example, we have reduced development expenses in our product portfolio by eliminating future investments and performance enterprise drives and narrowing our client HTD portfolio. Additional actions include our previously announced closures of manufacturing operations in China and Singapore.", "Turning to flash joint venture, the ramp of our 64 layer 3D flash technology, BiCS3, progressed well with further improvements in yields and productivity. The mix of our 3D flash bit supply approach 70% exceeding the December quarter with BiCS3 constituting more than 90% of 3D flash bits. Additionally, we commenced initial production of our 96-layer technology BiCS4 and began product shipments to retailers in the December quarter.", "We expect to ramp BiCS4 in the second half of the calendar year. From a fab standpoint, as we had announced in December, we will begin our participation in Fab 6 starting with the second investment tranche. Fab 6 operations are expected to commence in the next few months with our initial bit output in the third calendar quarter of 2018.", "From a flash industry perspective, we estimate bit growth in calendar 2017 was at the low end of the long-term range of 35% to 45% with Western Digital\u2019s growth somewhat higher than the industry given a relative strength in 64-layer 3D flash. In calendar 2018, we estimate industry bit growth to be near the high end of the long-term range due to improving manufacturing yields and continued transition to 3D flash with our growth consistent with the industry.", "Before I conclude, let me note that the normalization in flash markets is both expected and beneficial for the industry, creating new opportunities for flash. In fact extended periods of supply constraints limit market adoption and the pace of innovation.", "We view this normalization as a part of our business and it is our objective to leverage the strength and breadth of our portfolio to drive the best business outcome in a variety of market condition. In calendar 2018, we expect the Western Digital platform to strengthen further from the planned launches of several new products and solutions and I look forward to providing you further updates in the months ahead.", "I will now turn the call over to Mark for the financial discussions.", "Mark Long", "Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon everyone. I\u2019m very pleased with our financial performance in the December quarter. Our team executed well across our broad array of market as we capitalize on our diverse product portfolio, increase growth margins and achieved cost and expense target. All of which resulted in significant earnings growth.", "We also finished the December quarter with a strong liquidity position, as a result of our continued robust cash flow generation and we made progress on deleveraging and improving our capital structure. We had record revenue for the December quarter of $5.3 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year driven by strong performance in each of our end markets.", "Revenue in Data Center Devices and Solutions was $1.4 billion. Client Devices was $2.6 billion and Client Solutions was $1.3 billion. Our Data Center business continues to be fueled by cloud related storage demand. Our December quarter revenue for the Data Center Devices and Solutions increased 3% year-over-year. We saw significant growth from capacity enterprise hard drives, which was partially offset by an expected decline in performance enterprise hard drives.", "Client Devices revenue for the December quarter increased 9% year-over-year, primarily driven by significant growth in mobility, client SSDs and surveillance products. Client Solutions revenue for the December quarter, increased 17% year-over-year mostly as a result of the strength and reach of our valuable global retail brands.", "Our non-GAAP gross margin was 43.2% up 655 basis points year-over-year. This gross margin expansion resulted from a favorable supply demand environment for flash-based products. Cost improvements and a higher mix of flash-based revenue.", "With respect to operating expenses, our non-GAAP OpEx totaled $865 million. This included ongoing investments in product development, go-to-market capabilities, IT transformation projects and the first full quarter of operating expenses related to our recently acquired companies. As described in our December call, our operating expenses are higher than our October guidance driven entirely by the over achievement on our six months variable compensation plan.", "Our non-GAAP net interest and other expense for the December quarter was $180 million, a year-over-year decrease of approximately 19%. This includes a $197 million of interest expense for the December quarter, a decrease of $8 million year-over-year primarily from the re-pricing of our debt and the retirement of our euro term loan deep, partially offset by increases in LIBOR, which were approximately 70 basis points on a weighted average basis.", "Let me explain the impact of the recent tax reform on Western Digital. We will benefit from the new tax law by having the ability to access our global cash in the U.S. in a highly efficient manner. As a result, we will have greater flexibility with respect to our overall capital allocation and investment decision.", "In the December quarter, we booked a provisional net tax charge of $1.6 billion due primarily to the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax, which is included only in our GAAP results. The payment of this repatriation tax will be spread over the next eight years, which is expected to begin in fiscal 2019 with approximately 60% due in the last three years of the period.", "Beginning in fiscal 2019, we expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be at the high end or slightly above our long-term guidance of 7% to 12%. In the December quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 4% which was lower than our expectations because of the new tax legislation which resulted in a reduced U.S. corporate tax rate for the first half of fiscal 2018.", "On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the December quarter was $1.2 billion or $3.95 per share. On a GAAP basis, we had a net loss of $823 million or $2.78 per share driven by the one-time net charge related to tax reform. A GAAP net loss for the period also includes intangible amortization, charges related to integration activities and stock-based compensation.", "The net difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP result is primarily due to charges that have no cash impact within the quarter. In the December quarter, we generated $1.2 billion in operating cash flow, an increase of 12% year-over-year. We continued to reinvest in our business with $629 million in capital investments resulting in free cash flow of $553 million.", "On a fiscal year-to-date basis, we generated $2.3 billion in operating cash flow, an increase of 54% year-over-year. We deployed $915 million on capital investments resulting in year-to-date free cash flow of $1.4 billion. We paid the previous declared cash dividend totaling $148 million further during the quarter and also declared the dividend in the amount of $0.50 per share.", "We closed the quarter with cash, cash equivalence and available for sales securities totaling $6.4 billion resulting in approximately $7.9 billion of available liquidity including our $1.5 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. We repaid our euro term loan B in full and our net debt has decreased approximately $500 million to $5.8 billion at the end of the December quarter, mostly driven by cash flow generated by the business.", "We remain committed to the following capital allocation priorities. Organic and inorganic business investments deleveraging, optimizing our cost of capital and capital structure while enhancing our financial flexibility and delivering returns for our shareholders through our dividend and reauthorize share buyback program.", "We achieved our planned cost and OpEx synergy targets from both the HGST and SanDisk integrations within the expected timeframes. The combined savings of the programs have contributed to our strong financial results and validated our strategy for the acquisitions. While we have achieved our synergy target as of the end of the calendar 2017, we will continue to deliver and expense benefits from both of these transactions over the coming years.", "I will now provide our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 on a non-GAAP basis. We expect revenue to be approximately $4.9 billion consistent with a seasonally weaker fiscal third quarter. Gross margin to be between 42% and 43%. Operating expenses to be between 840 and $850 million which includes the annual payroll tax reset. Interest and other expense to be between 180 and $185 million. The effective tax rate in the 5 to 7% range and our diluted shares to be approximately 309 million.", "As a result, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $3.20 and $3.30. We believe our integrated product and technology platform is a key differentiator that will enable strong long-term growth, profitability and value creation through industry cycles. While we expect to see normal seasonality in the second half of fiscal 2018, we continue to see the opportunity to achieve revenue growth at the high end of our long-term model of 4 to 8% for fiscal 2018.", "Based on our current business outlook and capital structure, we now expect our non-GAAP earnings per share will be between $13.50 and $14 for fiscal 2018. For calendar 2018, we continue to expect revenue growth at the high end of our long term model. We also expect that non-GAAP gross margin will be above the high end of our long-term model range of 33% to 38% throughout the year.", "I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Your line is open.", "Mehdi Hosseini", "I want to start-off with the longer term question. In the past year, we were destructed by Toshiba. Now that looking forward, I would like to revisit your longer term method that you presented at Analyst Day December of 2016 has been a while. How should we think about those longer term growth and longer term objectives beyond the next few quarters? Is there any change -- is there any change in the strategy? And how do you see the Company evolving with the next few years especially in the context of updating us since you've been kind of absent over the past year or so?", "Steve Milligan", "Yes so, Mehdi, I would say that there has essentially been no fundamental change to our long-term strategy since we had our Analyst Day and growth rates from an industry perspective, from our perspective remained consistent. We constantly think about, how the market is evolving and changes and relook at our strategy, but I would say that right now there is no real fundamental change.", "One other thing that we are contemplating is, does it make sense to have in Investor Day coming up here in the fall. We haven\u2019t made a formal decision on that, but we will certainly from an internal perspective be refreshing our view on everything and providing appropriate updates to our investor base. But as a general statement, there has been no fundamental or big change to either our strategy or the fundamentals as we saw them at our Investor Day.", "Mehdi Hosseini", "Sure. But when I look at your segment information especially for December quarter, your Client Devices on a Q-over-Q basis to me was a little below expectation, it was down 1%, and your data center, you have to understand you may have been constrained by NAND shortage. But it doesn\u2019t show the kind of scaling that I thought it would happen maybe 18 months after acquisition of SanDisk, and this is why I was asking for an update. So, is there -- with the Toshiba overhang distraction had an impact? If not, how come we're not seeing the kind of outperformance that should have happened by now?", "Steve Milligan", "Well, I am not quite sure what numbers you are referring to. So I think we should probably take that offline and maybe dive into it a little bit. But fundamentally I think that, we\u2019re pleased. As Mike indicated, I\u2019ll comment on two things. One, if you want to call being a slight negative in that universe of expectation that we had capacity enterprise, last year grew a little bit less than what we had anticipated, that\u2019s a short-term statement. We talked about the reacceleration that was seemed here in the first half and through calendar 2018. So I would say that our data center and devices business kind of grow a little bit less than what we would expect longer term.", "On the positive side, Client Solutions which is a market segment that we had expected to kind of modestly decline over a period of time actually saw extraordinary growth, really speaking to the strength of our market position, the strength of our products or brands, et cetera. So, there is always going to be puts and takes within the particular segment. But on balance I have to say that I am very pleased with the way that the last 12 years, there was no Toshiba overhang from an execution perspective, and as I said, I am extremely proud of what our people have accomplished both from an operating and from a financial perspective.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Aaron Rakers", "Yes, if I can, one quick housekeeping question and then one other question. Can you just talk a little bit about where you stand today as far as debt to adjusted EBITDA? And how that relates to your capital return strategy? And then the question is and I\u2019m just curious, if you could address the enterprise SSD market? It didn\u2019t hear a lot about that during the script of the call. I\u2019m just curious of how you characterize your performance there, and if there is anything that we should think about going forward that might change the trajectory of that business?", "Steve Milligan", "Yes, let me take the enterprise SSD question first. So I think as we\u2019ve stated our product portfolio is sort of execution and expansion would happen in 2018 largely and then also towards the mid to second half of \u201918. So we are continuing to hold serve if you will, but we have more to do at the product level that we expect will become more meaningful, as the year progresses for the mid part of the year summer and beyond.", "Mark Long", "Yes, with respect to our debt-to-EBITDA, in terms of the way our EBITDA is calculated under our debt instruments, we are now below two times debt-to-EBITDA. So we\u2019re in a very good position, we have achieved a level that gives us strong flexibility in terms of what we want to do from a capital allocation standpoint and we will be evaluating our top priorities and kind of executing accordingly overtime.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Amit Daryanani", "I have a question and a follow-up as well. Maybe we\u2019ll start on the flash side, I think you guys mentioned industry and your bit growth would be at the high end of this 35% to 45% range. That seems fairly in line with, I think, a lot of peers are saying. I\u2019m just wondering though, how do you think of cost per bit decline trajectory as you go through that high end of that range, if you may? And if we do have normalization as you characterize in the flash market in \u201918. What do you think that does to your gross margin structure? Does that -- is normalization a stable driver, outside driver or downside driver to your gross margin?", "Mike Cordano", "Yes, so we\u2019ve talked about in this new 3D regime, the sort of way to think about annualized cost reduction is approximately 20% per year. I think in our previous call, we talked about our view of the environment is such that ASP declines, if you're seeing some up are largely offset by cost declines. We see that happening in the current period and we expect that to happen going forward.", "Steve Milligan", "Right, and as I indicated in my guidance for the calendar a year, as a result that\u2019s what gives us confidence that we will operate above our total gross margin model of 33% to 38% for the entire year.", "Amit Daryanani", "And if I could just follow up Mark, OpEx of March quarter slightly higher than I think what most of us were modeling. I\u2019m just wondering, how much of the payroll tax reset driving that in the March quarter? And then just broadly, how do I think about OpEx through calendar \u201918 for you guys as a range?", "Steve Milligan", "Good question. So, the rest for payroll tax is something on the order of $15 million or $17 million. And as a result, you can think about a -- I think what we talked about in terms of an $830 million kind of baselines quarterly run rate that we expect to decline and we have the number of activities ongoing to enhance efficiencies, so that that will decline on a quarterly basis throughout the year.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Wamsi Mohan", "Steve, I was wondering, you spoke about this pretty strong global economic backdrop to data center build out. Obviously, you are guiding on both the high capacity drives as well as NAND on the upside of these ranges. On the NAND side, the 35 to 45 range that you have for bit growth, how much of that is based on this improving economic backdrop? Or are you building in any elasticity of demand once you see this price normalization? And I have a follow-up.", "Steve Milligan", "Well, I'll answer the question this way. We have been saying and anticipating that the industry is going to grow at that high end of that 35% to 45% range for a while. And so, it really is more of a longer term statement as opposed to something that has changed over the last three to six months because of macroeconomic environment or something like that. And so, it takes a while that we think long-term plan and so we have seen the investment levels be pretty consistent with the growth levels.", "The one thing that we have seen recently that is an interesting dynamic is some companies that one are in the DRAM market as well as the NAND market, and then have the flexibility to convert 2D NAND to DRAM, they appeared to be doing that more so. So relative to that 35% to 45% or at that high end, there appears to be a little bit more of a downside by to that as opposed to about that it would exceed that. So we are beginning to see that kind of come down a bit, which is obviously good from a NAND perspective, right.", "Mike Cordano", "Right, the other thing I'll comment on as we look at the demand side of equation sort of expected capacity upgrades as we progress through the year, and how they translate through the demand cycle for NAND, we think that those numbers, not only are we in sort of a constructive period. As we see the year, we have the possibility of getting into a more constrained environment in the second half of the year.", "Wamsi Mohan", "Thanks, I appreciate that color and I try to quickly follow up. You spoke about this hyperscaler pick up. Any color geographically where you are seeing the most activity in the first half of 2018? And what is the average capacity of the drives of these hyperscalers?", "Steve Milligan", "Yes. So, I think we are seeing strong demand domestically as well as certainly in China that would be the one would stick out to us. Yes, I think and if you look at the capacity point is that general statement, the domestic relative to us here in the U.S., they send to take a highest cap drives. In China, they don't always necessarily take the highest cap drives that then speaks to this area where we had a bit of hole in our product portfolio in terms of 4 to 8 terabyte in air products, which we recently introduced in the air of cost competitive product that will help to better address that portion of the market at least vis-\u00e0-vis our product portfolio.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Your line is open.", "Ananda Baruah", "Just one or two around gross margins, SEC gross margin, if I could. Just have to clarify, I believe the comment around SEC gross margin in December, was that you guys just hold them flattish, and in flattish I might be paraphrasing, but I think that was the spirit of it. Does that still hold? I just want to check that. And then, what are you guys anticipating for a NAND ASP declines through this year? And I have a quick follow-up on gross margin there. Thanks.", "Mark Long", "Well, as you can see, our guidance for the quarter for the total gross margin is 42% to 43%. So, we\u2019re looking at very small changes in gross margin and I think it's -- we are seeing as Mike pointed out, some normalization in the flash market, but it's mostly offset from an ASP decline standpoint by the cost declines and as a result our gross margins are healthy.", "Steve Milligan", "Or relatively stable.", "Ananda Baruah", "I apologize. I was actually referring to the calendar year \u201918 guide.", "Mark Long", "Yes, so what we\u2019re seeing, I think in December where we talked about was being in a position where we would maintain total gross margins above the long-term range that we\u2019ve talked about, and that\u2019s certainly the case with respect to the trajectory of flash gross margins. I think the latest commentary I think you heard from Mike suggests that -- again while we may have some declines in gross margin -- remember some of declines in our total gross margin are also going to be a function of the seasonally weaker first half of the calendar year.", "And then in terms of the visibility in to the back half, as Mike pointed out, the gross margin trajectory will be a function of on the flash side how much this tightness in the market materializes. So, at this point, we continue to feel that it is a constructive market and as Mike pointed out there is this potential for tightening which would certainly have a positive effect on gross margin.", "Ananda Baruah", "What\u2019s your sort of base case expectation for NAND ASP declines for calendar \u201918?", "Mark Long", "We haven\u2019t disclosed that.", "Steve Milligan", "Yes, the only thing we\u2019ve said around that is, our expectation would be that the ASP declines would be largely offset by our cost declines and that gives you an idea.", "Mike Cordano", "Yes, with cost declines being in the 20% range.", "Ananda Baruah", "Right, okay. Is there any reason to think you\u2019ll be tremendously different from past cycles ASP declines?", "Steve Milligan", "Well, I think if you look at it that part of what we\u2019re saying is that, yes, it will be different than past cycles, in a positive way, and we try to talk to it and explain it as best to our ability, but it\u2019s a bigger market. So the incremental impact of capacity additions, I think that you are seeing also to some degree that\u2019s conversion from 2D NAND and the DRAM and that\u2019s moderating and I think you are just seeing a more rational set of behaviors economically focus that is resulting and still from volatility but not the same level of volatility that has been seen in the past.", "Mark Long", "And the maturity of the end market so the secular trends for demand remained strong and I think as Mike highlighted some normalization of the NAND market is actually very healthy because it will open new markets and it will increase demand in those mature markets to the extent of price sense. So we feel that calendar 2018 is a very constructive period and as Steve was highlighting, there were dynamics both on the supply side and on the demand side that you can just go and apply the patterns from previous cycles and think you are going to really get the right outcome for this period.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Stanley Kovler of Citi Research. Your line is open.", "Stanley Kovler", "I just wanted to clarify some of the trends in the near line market. So how should we think about the impact of mix? You've talked about selling more mid range drives versus high end and as we think about the entire near line revenue line within your HDD mix, especially going into the first half of the year. Could you remind us the levers there on gross margin between overall HDD volumes for you guys versus mix near line shipment to 60% there? And I have a follow up. Thank you.", "Steve Milligan", "Yes. So I think the thing to think about is it\u2019s a more diverse market now. So we're -- certainly, we have been focusing our strategy at the highest capacity drive, which remains a robust part of the market. We are now seeing demand across our range of capacities, so from a unit volume perspective, that helps, right. The way to think about leverage through our model though is ultimately about our component utilization.", "So, when you think about it most for CapEx on the drive side is tied up in heads and media manufacturing, and whether we can figure those as 12 or 14 terabytes or 8, the combination of those to get to the expected exabyte growth rate remains fairly common. So you are modeling just on contemplate different unit volume scenario than just as sort of historical view to the high cast.", "Stanley Kovler", "So when I think about the volume impact there versus the overall portfolio coming down. Can you help me understand how the mix shift is going to improve overall ASP as well?", "Mark Long", "So, we do expect overall ASPs to benefit from a mix standpoint on the HDD side and we as a result, you know we know we have the -- we\u2019ll have some volume declines from a seasonal standpoint and parts of the business. We do -- we see relatively stable gross margins.", "Stanley Kovler", "If I could ask a separate follow-up on more related to cash, you authorized or I should say reauthorize the buyback program back in November. And then if I look at the outlook for the share count looks about flattish with the current quarter. What are you contemplating in terms of share repurchases there?.", "Steve Milligan", "Yes, we have not made any public statements about our repurchase plans at this point.", "Stanley Kovler", "Any sense of timing on that to just provide an update or use of cash?", "Mike Cordano", "I think we\u2019ve already indicated our priorities. I mean and I don\u2019t want to go through what was already read, but first thing as we invest back in our business, optimize our capital structure, deleverage and repurchases on that list, and it will be contemplated with the a broader set of capital allocation considerations, as we look to drive longer term value creation.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Cihra of Guggenheim. Your line is open.", "Robert Cihra", "A clarification and although one question, if that\u2019s alright. The clarification just in your slide you\u2019ve briefly mentioned, and if there is no more development or point back development on performance drives and so, is that like stopping development on 10-K? And does that mean they go end of life or they go end of life at one point or is it just pulling back? I just was wondering if you could give a little info there.", "Mike Cordano", "Yes, let me be very clear, we have ceased development on 10 and 15-K RPM hard drives. So, our products in the market are the last of our products, and we will obviously manage them through a long tail, but we don\u2019t intend to introduce new products.", "Rob Cihra", "Can you tell us what that tail might be? Is this a tail of months or years?", "Mike Cordano", "No it\u2019s a long tail of years.", "Rob Cihra", "Alright and then if I could ask the actual question. There has just been decent amount of debate frankly for several months now in terms of how much the tightness in demand has helped to drive market and get any obviously you sell both. Can you talk if you think there has been a meaningful equal help for drives or left cannibalization than there would have otherwise been because of tightness? Or do you really think it's had that much impact obviously looking back and then looking forward, if you think that\u2019s about to change it all?", "Mike Cordano", "Yes, so there is only one real area that, that has had an effect and its really in mobile. So 2.5 inch drives and then we would say it had a modest positive effect on the size of the HDD markets and then looking at rearview mirror. So, our penetration rate if you will flash to HBD is running behind our original expectations. What we see happening this year is more normalizing of that trend.", "Steve Milligan", "In other words the penetration of SSD in notebook based configurations will accelerate, right, which we are agnostic to positive.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman of Cowen & Co. Your line is open.", "Karl Ackerman", "I actually wanted to focus on your progress and strategy of your systems business, particularly now that you have had some time to integrate Tegile in your operations in addition to your JV with Unis over a year ago now that strengthens your opportunity to go after Asia hyperscale players, who actually have a large contribution to the increasing global hyperscale CapEx. So could you elaborate on what you have done so far to integrate those businesses? And whether or not you actually have all the pieces in your portfolio, you like to target this area of the storage market? And I have a quick follow-up please.", "Steve Milligan", "Sure. Yes, so I think the recent acquisition of Tegile was a positive step forward across all markets, but particular to your question on China because the adoption of object storage in China is lagging slightly so the ability to have a file front end and be able to lead with the product is more mature in the market then pages to our participation in the China market.", "So I think from an overall portfolio standpoint, we are encouraged by the addition of the product that came to the Tegile acquisition. We continue to make steady progress although we don\u2019t talk specifically about the growth rate and size of that. It is growing sequentially and we\u2019re making good progress and I think we\u2019re happy with the results, particularly in the last couple of quarters as we\u2019ve added the addition of these file all flash or ray products to our portfolio.", "Karl Ackerman", "As a follow-up, I would appreciate if you could elaborate on how much your cost saving assumption in your NAND business adhere includes the qualification of your internal NAND supply in your own enterprise SSD business?", "Mark Long", "That\u2019s an easy question, I'll take it. The answer is none. So when we did SanDisk acquisition, we talked about is vertical integration opportunity and we actually decided especially when the markets went into a constrained position that extending out our relationship with Intel who gave us access to more bits and that has worked well for us and we\u2019ve got some product introductions are going well with Intel. So from a business standpoint, not having our own NAND in all of our enterprise SSD we having some but not all that actually yielding a better long-term economic outcome than that we replaced all the Intel products immediately.", "Mike Cordano", "Right and I'll just add to that certainly that it\u2019s a testament to the way that relationship is going, the quality of those products in the marketplace and what we think we can do it from also allowing us to focus our product R&D on other thing. So, there is a number of benefits in this choice that's advantaging us through calendar 2018.", "Mark Long", "Right, and the good news is as I indicated, we do still have the 20-20 target for the SanDisk transaction that will include significant benefits from vertical integration, so intersecting with our own product line that has our own name by that time period.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho. Your line is open.", "Vijay Rakesh", "Just looking at the hard disk drive side, I saw you guys mention in starting the ramp of 12 and 14 terabyte drives. As you get small now just wondering what the mix would be as we exit 2018 with 12 and 14 terabyte?", "Mike Cordano", "Yes, we would expect as we exit calendar 2018 on the high cap range, it will be majority of our mix, but I did mention 12 and 14 together. And -- but I did mention what we do expect is this more diverse market as we pursue continued growth. So we will see a continued and steady mix up at the highest end of our portfolio but given different used cases and workloads, both technologically but also geographically we do think we\u2019ll see a longer tail of shipments at the lower capacities, as we referenced in this announcement of these mid range product that we announced for a week or so ago.", "Vijay Rakesh", "On the demand side, I saw BiCS3, I assume that 64-layer was almost 70% plus shipments now. So, as we go through 2018, what are the puts and takes on the NAND gross margin? Where can you drive cost down, I guess 96-layer is more later in the year, but just wondering as you go through the year where the puts and takes in the gross NAND margins?", "Mike Cordano", "Well, so two things. One is continued yield and productivity on the existing ramps that is on throughput which is ongoing on that\u2019s a big statement and then of course as we move to the new node in the second half of the year that gives us additional opportunity.", "Vijay Rakesh", "Got it.
