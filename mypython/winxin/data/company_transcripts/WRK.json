Davidson & Company", "Operator", "Good morning. My name is Carol and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the WestRock Company special announcements and first quarter FY '17 results call. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Matt Tractenberg, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Matt Tractenberg", "Thank you, Carol. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us this morning for this special call. Today, we set aside an hour to discuss the announcements made this morning with our acquisition of Multi Packaging Solutions by WestRock as well as our first quarter 2017 results. You can find today's release on both companies' websites.", "With me on today's call are WestRock's Chief Executive Officer, Steve Voorhees; Ward Dickson, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Porter, President of Business Development in Latin America; Jeff Chalovich, President of Corrugated Packaging; and Bob Feeser, President of our Consumer Packaging segment.", "I'd like to spend just a few minutes providing a high-level overview of the key takeaways of the first quarter results, then the remainder of our time today discussing the announcement, WestRock's acquisition of Multi Packaging Solutions. A separate full earnings presentation with all supplemental slides that we normally provide is posted on our website at ir.westrock.com.", "We have prepared slides to supplement our comments during today's conference call. These slides you're seeing now are also posted on the Investor Relations section of WestRock's website and can be accessed through the link in the right of the application you're using to view this webcast. Following our prepared comments, we will open up the call for questions and answers. As we have a lot to cover today, we ask that each person limit themselves to one question only, please. If there's time at the end of the Q&A session, we'll take more.", "I'd like to point out the disclaimers on the second slide please. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we discuss during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the SEC, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016.", "Additionally, we will be referencing adjusted or non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We've provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the Appendix of the slide presentation. The slide presentation is available on our website. So with that said, I'll turn the call over to you, Steve.", "Steve Voorhees", "Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We're well on our way to implementing our strategic plan. We're building an industry leader that's well-positioned to profitably grow, by serving attractive paper and packaging markets. WestRock offers a unique set of product and capabilities to our customers, from corrugated boxes to folding cartons to in-store displays.", "These product and capabilities allow us to work with customers to provide them with differentiated paper and packaging solutions. That's what we're working toward and I'm happy to be able to say we're making progress with this strategy in the marketplace. For the past six quarters, we've transformed our portfolio in a way that's seldom seen from public companies. The merger between Rock-Tenn and MWV brought two complementary industry leaders together.", "We've improved our folding carton business to our acquisition of Cenveo Packaging and strengthened our corrugated packaging business with the purchase of SP Fiber. We've continued to rightsize our mill network. We integrated the Carolina Commercial Print Product line and gained a successful partner in Mexico through our joint venture with Grupo Gondi. We're moving quickly to monetize our land and development portfolio.", "Last spring, we spun off our specialty chemicals business into Ingevity. As you saw yesterday, we've entered into an agreement to sell our Home, Health & Beauty business to Silgan, from which we're expecting that $1 billion in proceeds after tax and after transaction fees. This cash will be used for our most recent strategic announcements, the acquisition of Multi Packaging Solutions, a leading global provider of print-based specialty packaging solutions, serving attractive markets.", "This portfolio news have focused and strengthened our core paper and packaging businesses. I believe that WestRock is in an outstanding position to develop our capabilities, enhance our reach, improve our margins and generate attractive returns to stockholders. Before discussing the MPS transaction, Ward and I will provide highlights on our first quarter performance.", "Sales for the quarter were $3.4 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $490 million, for a margin, 14.2%. Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.47 in the quarter. $50 million in higher input cost, including 20% increases to both OCC and caustic soda prices and a 30% increase in energy cost, contributed to the year-over-year EBITDA decline. Results were also unfavorably impacted by previously announced consumer-grade price reductions, Hurricane Matthew and a legal settlement.", "These headwinds were largely offset by the favorable impact of our ongoing productivity programs in our corrugated segment which is successfully implementing a container board price increase across both domestic and export markets. The corrugated packaging team delivered solid results in the quarter that included the negative impact of prior-year price reductions, somewhat offset by recently announced price increases and meaningful inflation. Box shipments increase 2.2% per day as compared to last year, highlighting the strength from eCommerce, retail and consumer and produce and agricultural markets.", "North American adjusted EBITDA margins were 15.8%. The year-over-year decline resulted from higher input costs. Productivity improvements drove a $42 million benefit in the quarter from a year-ago period and the domestic container board price increase began to flow through our results, with a $14 million favorable impact in the first quarter. We expect to exit the second quarter at a quarterly run rate in excess of $50 million. Adjusted EBITDA declined by $38 million from the prior year, more than half of which was related to Hurricane Matthew and the legal settlement.", "Excluding the 33,000 tons of lower production caused by the hurricane, our total segment shipments were above our expectations. Healthy demand in our export markets allowed us to announce a price increase which we'll begin to realize some benefits starting this month. And we managed our inventories well despite the hurricane, with levels that were largely unchanged from the fourth quarter of FY '16.", "We're confident in our ability to improve our results in our corrugated segment. This is a top priority for our Company. We have made and will make investments in our mill and box plant network, our processes and our people. This agenda will support our ability to serve our customers with our differentiated solutions and products to fundamentally improve our cost position, improve our integration levels, generate strong cash flows and improve our margins.", "Given the challenging market dynamics, our consumer packaging segment generated stable results in the quarter, with higher input costs and lower volume mostly offset by strong productivity performance. Shipments of paperboard and converted products were up slightly and the segment delivered revenues and EBITDA of $1.5 billion and $215 million, respectively. $14 million in productivity was driven by continued internalization of SBS volumes, procurement cost reductions and our ongoing performance excellence program. Our SBS and CNK backlog now stand at four weeks and CRB at two weeks. Dollar growth in the foodservice and liquid packaging markets were offset by softer demand for processed foods and tobacco.", "During the first 11 months of 2016, North American folding carton industry sales declined 1.3% due to lower volumes and pricing. For that same period, WestRock's folding carton organic sales in North America increased 1.4%, driven by strong volume, partially offset by lower pricing.", "Beverage sales were stable. Looking forward, we see a stable demand environment and continued input cost inflation. We've announced price increases to our customers for both CRB and ERB. Ward, I will turn it over to you for second quarter guidance.", "Ward Dickson", "Thank you, Steve. Please note that we have excluded any potential impact of the MPS acquisition in both our full-year free cash flow or second quarter EPS guidance presented here. First, with regard to our full-year free cash flow guidance, we're reaffirming our guidance of $1.2 billion of adjusted free cash flow even after accounting for the sale of HHB five months into the year.", "For the second quarter, we expect sequential adjusted earnings per diluted share, modestly higher than the $0.47 per share achieved in the first quarter. For the purpose of modeling, we have provided the key sequential drivers that will impact the quarter. First, we will benefit in the range of $50 million to $60 million of EBITDA across volume, price and mix from seasonally higher volumes in both consumer and corrugated as well as four more box shipping days and less maintenance downtime.", "Inflationary pressures across energy, fiber and chemicals impacted us more than we expected in the December quarter. As you have seen in November and December, recycled fiber prices and energy have continued to rise. As a result, we estimate a range of $45 million to $60 million increase in sequential costs, including wage inflation this quarter. The first-calendar quarter includes annual wage increases taking effect for much of our workforce as well as the restart of payroll taxes.", "Additionally, we will no longer have the negative impact of Hurricane Matthew or the legal settlement in the second quarter which, together with other one-time items, resulted in a $15 million sequential benefit. We expect to complete the sale of Home, Health & Beauty in the quarter and we will lose approximately $0.01 of sequential after-tax earnings.", "Steve, I will hand it back over to you so that we can discuss the announcement.", "Steve Voorhees", "Thanks Ward. I'm going to shift gears and discuss our agreement to purchase Multi Packaging Solutions. Why it's such a compelling, strategic and financial transaction for WestRock. We've been interested in this business for some time now so we're delighted to have reached this agreement.", "Turning to slide 11, provides a summary of the strategic rationale, financial considerations pertinent to our acquisition of Multi Packaging Solutions. Since merging Rock-Tenn and MWV in 2015, we developed the most comprehensive portfolio of paper and packaging solutions in the industry.", "The focus is on providing customers with unmatched depth and breadth of product and services to help them win in their markets. Our agreement to purchase MPS is another step in that journey and one that greatly advances our business, both strategically and financially. The acquisition of MPS is highly aligned with our strategy.", "From MPS' market positioning, products, geographic presence, production footprint to its relationships with its customers, MPS has a strong fit with our consumer packaging business and it represents an important part of our evolution toward higher growth, higher value businesses.", "MPS strengthens our portfolio of differentiated value-added product offerings and enables us to serve a broad range of customers' needs for paper and packaging solutions. This further supports our enterprise sales approach as we look to build long term relationships with our customers and increase our share of their packaging needs.", "MPS enhances our participation in the attractive growing segments of consumer packaging where we're well positioned to compete. The segments include health care, cosmetics, confectionery and high-end spirits. The requirements of our customers across these markets is increasing. Market trends are leading to channel, product and SKU proliferation.", "And the corresponding need for shorter run sizes, more declaration and more differentiation to stand out in increasingly competitive markets. The combined capability of WestRock after the acquisition will be well suited to meet these requirements. We will have substantial potential to expand our customer relationships by offering MPS' solutions to WestRock's customer base and WestRock's solutions to MPS' customer base.", "MPS balances our revenue mix between our corrugated and consumer packaging segments and it brings $85 million of synergy and performance improvement opportunities, including converting MPS into a customer for WestRock's paperboard. The increased paperboard consumption will allow us to replace pulp production across our SBS system. This meaningful mix improvement further insulates our SBS system from demand volatility.", "The financials of the acquisition are compelling. We're paying $18 per share for MPS and assuming their debt for a total enterprise value of $2.28 billion. This equates to 9.6 times trailing 12-months adjusted EBITDA and 7.1 times after including full run rate synergies and performance improvements. The acquisition will be accretive to our earnings per share and cash flow from the start. This is inclusive of the impact of purchase accounting.", "We expect to fund the transaction through a combination of cash on hand in both the United States and Europe, approximately $1 billion from the sale of Home, Health & Beauty, when it closes and existing committed borrowing capacity. On a pro forma basis, our capitalization will remain strong, with a leverage of 2.55 times including synergies.", "Following the transaction, more than $1.5 billion credit capacity will remain available to us to continue executing our strategic plan. The transaction is subject to normal regulatory approvals and requires approval by MPS shareholders. While MPS has been public since October of 2015, it's majority owned by Madison Dearborn Partners and the Carlyle Group. We expect to close the transaction in our fiscal third quarter ending in June of 2017.", "Our business generates very robust and consistent free cash flows. This acquisition aligns very well with our balanced capital allocation approach which is focused on investing for growth, both organically and inorganically, maintaining capital expenditures and returning meaningful capital to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends.", "We evaluated this acquisition on a number of factors, including earnings and cash flow accretion, improving our business, providing future growth opportunities. We believe that on all of these items this acquisition delivers a superior return profile when compared to repurchasing shares.", "Our Management Team has a track record of solid execution. Since forming WestRock in 2015, we've achieved more than half of our goal for run rate synergies, ahead of our expectations. We've completed a number of transactions to focus our business. I am confident in our ability to deliver on a successful integration of MPS into WestRock due to the quality of the WestRock and MPS teams and the alignment of MPS' business and culture with WestRock.", "I've had the pleasure of getting to know both Marc Shore, MPS' Chief Executive Officer and Dennis Kaltman, President, over the last few months and developed an even greater appreciation for them as a Management Team. I can't wait to have them join our team at WestRock. Marc and Dennis have spent their entire lives in the packaging industry. Marc's family company, Shorewood, acquired Dennis' family business in 1998 and they have worked together ever since.", "It has been a productive partnership over this time. Marc started MPS in 2005 and Dennis joined the business the following year. Together, they have built MPS through a series of 17 acquisitions and one merger, had a proven track record of integrating packaging businesses, realizing synergies and delivering value for new packaging products and capabilities.", "MPS' clients are some of the largest and most demanding companies in the world, with complex needs and requirements. By combining MPS' capabilities with those that exist at WestRock today will create opportunities to further differentiate our offerings and bring another level of value to our customers. MPS is a leading provider of high value-added print-based specialty packaging serving attractive and growing end-markets. Almost all their sales are to Consumer and Healthcare markets; sectors that are expected to grow at low- to mid-single digit growth rates through 2020. In Consumer, they serve image-sensitive markets such as confectionery, cosmetics, fragrance, spirits and other high-value goods.", "In Healthcare, MPS is known for their ability to provide complementary packaging components, speed to market, quality control, brand security and environmental solutions. These are markets that demand innovation, customized solutions, rapid new product development and a high performance to meet regulatory requirements. Like WestRock, MPS has close and long-standing relationships with their customers. They bring expertise in branding and regulatory compliance which are critical to companies in the Consumer and Healthcare sectors. They have established a reputation for working with customers to meet the challenges of operating in these industries and delivering consistent high-quality solutions.", "They are a leading supplier of premium folding cartons which will integrate nicely and complement WestRock's business. They also provide products such as inserts and labels which will extend the range of capabilities we can provide to our combined customer base. The transaction further diversifies WestRock's geographic presence, allowing us to better support our customers with the solutions that they need where they need them.", "MPS will further strengthen WestRock's position in North America and expand our presence as the industry leading provider of folding cartons in Europe. At the same time, MPS' operation in Asia will establish a platform for WestRock to leverage growth opportunities in that region, enhancing its already strong combined position in emerging markets.", "Turning to slide 14, MPS has a superb and highly diversified roster of long-standing world-class customers. Highly customized, short run, premium packaging and labeling is increasingly complex and valued by these customers. The ability for customers to effectively market their product with unique graphics is something they offer to customers within the Consumer and Healthcare industries. Bundling, folding cartons, leaflets and labels is a service that sets MPS apart from competitors.", "We will be able to bundles these capabilities with our products such as corrugated and displays and create an even more powerful customer offering. I will now turn it over to Ward, who will walk through some of the financial aspects of the transaction. Ward?", "Ward Dickson", "Thank you, Steve. Turning to slide 15, where I will first cover how we plan to integrate MPS and execute the opportunities to realize significant operating and financial synergies. I will then discuss our pro forma outlook for the combined Company. As Steve mentioned, we've demonstrated a strong record of successfully integrating businesses, just as we have done with a combination of Rock-Tenn and MWV as well as our more recently acquisition of SP Fiber and the Cenveo Packaging assets.", "We see a number of opportunities where, together with MPS, we can achieve efficiencies and savings to meaningfully increase our combined earnings. The largest are the opportunities to integrate our operating assets. MPS consumes 225,000 tons per year of paperboard which is largely bleached paperboard.", "This creates the opportunity to integrate 35% to 45% of this consumption. This additional integration will largely eliminate pulp from our SBS system and helps insulate our mills from market demand volatility. MPS operates an extensive manufacturing footprint of 59 facilities across North America, Europe and Asia.", "The addition of the MPS footprint will provide us the ability to operate our manufacturing assets across the new system, allowing us better to match our customers' needs to our most productive assets. Using our combined scale, we expect cost savings within procurement of raw materials, goods and services, along with reductions in overhead and public company expenses.", "Lastly, there is additional upside from cross-selling a broader portfolio of products and services across our combined customer base. We have not modeled significant revenue synergies but we believe this represents a significant opportunity. In total, we think we can achieve a run rate synergies and performance improvements of $85 million by the end of our September 2019 fiscal year.", "Slide 16 gives you a picture of what the combined business would look like after the purchase of MPS and assuming we achieve the $85 million in targeted synergies. Not only will the transaction be immediately cash flow and EPS accretive but as you can see through our cost savings efforts, it will be margin accretive as well.", "Upon closing, we will pay off MPS' debt using domestic and foreign cash. WestRock's balance sheet will remain extremely strong, with leverage of approximately 2.55 times, consistent with an investment-grade credit rating. With that, I will turn it back over to Steve.", "Steve Voorhees", "Thanks Ward. We're excited about the MPS transaction. MPS will make WestRock a better Company. MPS will add to WestRock's already comprehensive suite of packaging solutions and increase our capabilities in healthcare, cosmetics, spirits and confectionery packaging, while further diversifying our product offering with labels and inserts.", "And, we will gain additional access to international high-growth consumer end-markets. The acquisition of MPS will further WestRock's vision to be the premier partner and unrivaled provider of winning solutions for our customers.", "As we're successful, we will be able to create value for our customers, employees and our stockholders. We look forward to sharing more information as we move forward. That concludes my prepared remarks. Matt, we're ready for questions.", "Matt Tractenberg", "Thanks, Steve. As a reminder to our audience, please limit your questions to one, with a follow-up if necessary. We will get to as many as time allows. Carol, we're ready for our first question, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question this morning comes from Scott Gaffner from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Scott Gaffner", "Steve, my question is a little bit of a higher-level question on M&A and specifically you talked about MPSX, you talked about a business that has more change-overs, greater SKUs, lower volumes, I think higher value-add -- I'm paraphrasing a little bit. But it would seem that maybe there was some opportunity to add that same type of business within your corrugated segment as well. Why did it make sense to add MPSX within the consumer packaging versus maybe going after a similar type of a business model within the corrugated business?", "Steve Voorhees", "First of all, you've got the rationale for MPS spot on. I think you have also identified opportunities in corrugated. I don't view that as being a choice. I think that's our strategy for the Business is to be paper and packaging solutions provider, providing both corrugated and consumer.", "So we've been doing, I think, a very good job at meeting needs in both consumer and corrugated packaging markets. I could see additional activity, both organic and inorganic, on the corrugated side along the lines you've described.", "Scott Gaffner", "Okay. Just quickly, you said you're bringing the management team over. You said they pursued a roll-up strategy with 17 acquisitions, one merger. Is this going to be managed as a separate business unit or how do you envision the business being managed on a go-forward basis? Thanks and good luck.", "Steve Voorhees", "Sure. Marc Shore will report to me and will work closely with Bob Feeser to -- as part of the corrugated packaging segment -- I'm sorry, as part of the consumer packaging segment.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Debbie Jones", "I was just curious, you're targeting it looks like about 80,000 to 100,000 tons of integration with the deal. Can that number go higher and are there any supply agreements that would provide -- cause problems with this?", "Bob Feeser", "Hi, Debbie, this is Bob Feeser. We're actually working through that as we speak. There's certainly the potential for that opportunity to be larger than we have indicated. But we're in the early stages of that. The markets that are currently being served with paperboard are markets that we're very familiar with and markets that certainly could be reached with our paperboard, but we're going to work through that over the next four or five months.", "Debbie Jones", "Could you guys just talk a bit more about the cross-selling opportunities you talked about? How viable is this really order of magnitude with the other -- the actual synergies that you called out and the timing of something like this?", "Steve Voorhees", "MPS has been very successful in bundling, say, leaflets and labels with their folding carton business. We're also having success on our side as well, combining our products. And I'm going to ask Jeff Chalovich to talk about what we're doing in that area in corrugated.", "Jeff Chalovich", "To Steve's point, we've had good success bringing the enterprise to our customers. We have a couple of examples. I will give you a large one and a mid-size one, just to give you a range of what we're doing. One of the large ones, we have a large relationship with corrugated packaging with a consumer packaging buy that we did not have. We have embedded customer service people there. We have a differentiated solutions and a private label brand and we were able to bring our folding carton group in with sales in the tens of millions of dollars in that which is new to our Business.", "The second example, we use the entire enterprise in our machine platform, a smaller boutique liquor provider. We put machine solution to automate the back end of their lines. We did an eight-sided corrugated packaging model wide high graphics. We use our RTS group for the partitions; the single-serve liquor bottles we brought in our folding carton and that was in the $5 million to $10 million range for our Business. We're seeing great success in that, in really being a solutions provider and we're leading with solutions, not product-centric.", "Bob Feeser", "Debbie, just one other follow-up, one of the things that we're really excited about with MPS is the labels and inserts and the ability to leverage that across our customer base. And then also with MPS, we see opportunities for that team to leverage both corrugated and displays. As you might imagine, a number of those end markets, the consumer markets, as well as health care, the opportunity for displays is quite large and today, MPS sells very little of that. So a nice opportunity, we believe, that we'll be developing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Anthony Pettinari", "MPS had a large footprint in Europe which I guess is buying FPB, not SBS. Is there a longer term opportunity to integrate your boxboard tons into the European converting assets? If not, are you happy to just run them as they are or could you potentially reevaluate their place in the WestRock portfolio over the longer term?", "Bob Feeser", "We're certainly going to look at that. We currently sell significant volumes into Europe today of both our CNK product, as well as SBS. So they are markets that we're very familiar with. Our plans initially are to work very closely with Marc and the team to identify those opportunities, primarily in the confectionery, cosmetics and beauty areas where we have a lot of experience to integrate with our paperboard. But over time, certainly, would like to do more.", "Anthony Pettinari", "And then, Steve, maybe just bigger-picture question on the acquisition, when I think about MPS, I think of an entrepreneurial, maybe smaller organization. Looking at the past deals you've done, culturally, how do you ensure that you retain that kind of agility and nimbleness as part of WestRock's much larger organization? And are there changes that you need to make to the WestRock organization, maybe the sales organization, to continue to move from a company that manages paper mills really well to being much more of a customer-focused packaging company that can do a lot of these specialty products?", "Steve Voorhees", "We think we're a customer-focused packaging company now. We also operate mills well. I have been delighted to be able to spend time with Marc Shore and Dennis for the past several months. I think it's a great fit. I think both of our organizations are going to be a lot better because of the combination. So I look at this as entirely opportunity for us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "George Staphos", "Good luck with the transaction and with MPSX. Thanks for all the details thus far. I want to take a different approach on a lot of the questions that have been asked, I think, in terms of the fit of MPSX with WestRock. We've known Shorewood and MPSX for a number of years. We'd acknowledge your comment about it being -- having a lot of experience in terms of management and being a solutions provider.", "Having said that, at the same time, since the IPO, MPSX had been somewhat of an uneven performer. Going back long enough in history, Steve, the entity was largely owned by one of your peers and ultimately that peer exited owning Shorewood.", "Considering that, considering some of the challenges that MPS has had with the UK or with multimedia, why do you think owning this business from here will -- you'll be more successful than what we have seen in recent case studies? Is it around the integration level? Is it around something else? What makes you more confident about owning that asset after what we've seen in the history for MPS and Sherwood previously? And then I had a follow-on.", "Steve Voorhees", "I think Shorewood was owned by another organization. That was before I came into the business. I came into the business a long time ago. So it was just a different business, different time. So I really can't comment on that very effectively.", "What I can comment on is I think we've been very clear on our strategy and very clear on what we want to do with respect to markets. MPS adds better markets to us. It expands our service and product offerings. We've got opportunities to add synergies and performance improvements.", "I think we're the best buyer and the best owner for the company. I think MPS can bring a great deal to us and vice versa. So I just think it makes sense for us. I think with respect to the uneven performance, I think we've had -- there has been volatility in the markets. I think if you look at this on a long term basis, maybe like, say, a year or two, three years, it's just going to make us a better Company.", "George Staphos", "Okay. Steve, I don't disagree in terms of the fit necessarily. But if you had to think about it or guide us one way or another and recognizing there are a number of things that you pointed to in terms of why the deal makes sense, do you think it's more around the integration or do you think it really is around the culture and the opportunities MPSX now affords WestRock in terms of niche businesses, shorter runs, although that has its challenges, too, management approach, et cetera. What would you guide us to, if you had to pick one side or the other?", "Steve Voorhees", "The latter, the market is moving that way. We want to move with the market.", "George Staphos", "My follow-on, just on consumer volume trends, when do you think we will get to a point where we see -- and you are not alone, so I'm not singling you out -- but from a market standpoint, volume trends in the industry improve on a more sustainable basis? Do you think it's around employment and wages and that sort of thing or do you think we're in a period of secular stagnation, at least in terms of processed foods and what it means for your Business, recognizing that you've done better than the markets. Thanks, guys and good luck in the quarter.", "Bob Feeser", "Thanks. Just on that point, as we indicated, our paperboard and converted products volumes were up slightly in the quarter. We're continuing to see the secular headwinds around processed foods. But we're seeing good growth in a number of areas like foodservice and liquid packaging. Also, some of the markets that we will be going deeper in with MPS around healthcare. These markets are very much--", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Mark Wilde", "Steve, I've watched you do a lot of deals very successfully over time and I think that the math on this looks pretty straightforward. But to just come back to the question that George was asking, I mean, we watched your competitor with Shorewood. But in addition, MeadWestvaco bought over $1 billion worth of specialty converting businesses in the early 2000s and they are basically all gone now, including a very nice pharma packaging business.", "What do you have to do differently now so that you don't repeat what happened with some of these companies in the past? Is it different incentive systems for the sales people when they are dealing with this higher value-add stuff? What is it going to take?", "Steve Voorhees", "I wasn't at either one of the companies when they bought them, so I really can't comment from knowledge based on what they did. I can comment on what MPS does and WestRock does. I think we're very well aligned. We do at very similar times, our businesses complement one another.", "I take your point on wanting to align the incentive systems. And I think we've done that very effectively at WestRock across a number of businesses. I will also point out that on the -- one of the businesses that you identified, I think we had made on Home, Health & Beauty, that management team had performed outstandingly well over the past three years. In fact, I was recognized on the call yesterday. So I have a high degree of confidence in our ability to integrate and in large part because of my knowledge of the people at WestRock and the knowledge that I have of the way MPS operates their business.", "Mark Wilde", "Just as a follow-on, Steve, I'm just curious, as it stands right now and as you look at the input cost environment out there, is the full increase in containerboard, is that going to cover inflation as you see it right now?", "Ward Dickson", "Mark, this is Ward. Let me tell you that. So we've been pretty consistent, I think, as we talked about in the second half of last year and entering into this year that we could see a scenario where our raw material costs would -- inflation would be between, on a total Company basis, between $175 million to $200 million. Our run rate in the first quarter was $50 million on a year-over-year basis.", "The rise in OCC in the quarter was something that we did not expect. So the sequential inflation that we had from Q4 to Q1 was actually higher than we anticipated. But what we did talk about was the fact that we're getting to the full realization of the price increase.", "So from a Company point of view, I think the input cost inflation could be over the $200 million level for the full year. It's going to be highly dependent upon OCC trends as we go into the second half of the year. Again, the full pricing realization will be there on the domestic side as we exit next quarter and we will start to get the benefits from the export price increase as well. So I think we will have margin improvement in our corrugated business as we move into the second half of the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Chip Dillon", "I'm certainly seeing, excuse me, some pretty good accretion for 2018 with these two moves. I just needed a little bit of help. I know that it looks like Multi Packaging Solutions' DD&A or at least depreciation and amortization, was around -- or is going to be around $120 million. But obviously you guys have some step-up, but I would suspect it's not all that much because the assets have already been stepped up recently. Can you just give us a ballpark as to what that step-up might be for DD&A? And then also maybe what the CapEx will be on those assets? I know it's been around $60 million annualized.", "Ward Dickson", "We consider the CapEx trends will be consistent with the historical trends. Clearly, we have only done initial modeling of what the incremental DD&A can be, based on the purchase price allocation. We will give you more clarity to that as we get closer to closing. But I would model our initial modeling as probably an incremental $20 million to $25 million.", "Chip Dillon", "Of DD&A. Okay, got you. Then as a quick follow-up, I know your incremental debt will go up about $1.2 billion or so because of the proceeds from the sale. But your EBITDA is also going up. So thinking about everything and it would seem like you would feel comfortable buying back stock maybe as early as late 2017, maybe the beginning of FY '18. Is that a fair assumption?", "Ward Dickson", "I believe we will continue to have the capacity and the balance sheet strength and underlying cash flow to look at all of our alternatives in our capital allocation, including additional acquisitions, additional investments organic investments into our -- for cost -- our return-generating investments and repurchasing stock. So the answer is yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Mark Weintraub", "In the fourth quarter, the calendar quarter, box demand seemed to be extremely strong. Just wanted to get your sense as to what was driving it? What you saw in your system driving it? How much of the eCommerce effect really was at the core? And also what you are seeing in January with investors especially interested given that cost pressures are eroding a lot of the benefits from the price initiative?", "Jeff Chalovich", "In the fourth quarter, eCommerce was a driver for our Business. We were up 2.2% this quarter and that was a holdover. So the eCommerce for us year over year was almost 19%, so a large increase. We also were up in retail and consumer, almost 9% and our dairy business was up about the same. So all of those were very strong in the quarter.", "As we entered January, after 12 days, we were up over 1.5 points. So we're between 1% and 1.5% right now. So the demand is still good and steady. And there's, of course, eCommerce has fallen off a bit, but our other segments are steady right now.", "Mark Weintraub", "How would you be characterizing the market? Does it feel quite tight relative to where it was three months ago, say? Has it loosened a little bit? How would you characterize the market?", "Jeff Chalovich", "What we're experiencing is still tight market. Our demand is good in all of our channels, so domestic, box and exports. We still have some export on allocation. We still have tons remaining to ship from the last quarter that we have not shipped yet. We're allocating tons in export. And then our domestic and box, we're still tight. Our S&OP team is doing a great job managing inventories, but what we're experience is tight conditions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Phil Ng", "Question for Ward, you reiterated your $1.2 billion free cash flow guide. But you're obviously seeing a little more inflation. I forget if you previously included HH&B. How are you bridging that gap and any color on the free cash flow contribution you expect from Multipack?", "Ward Dickson", "So the reiteration or reaffirmation of the $1.2 billion excludes MPS. It does include the loss of five months' worth of cash flow or seven months' worth of cash flow for HH&B. We have estimated that will be in the $20 million to $25 million range.", "I think we see some offsets in the ability to generate some more cash out of L&D versus -- our land and development operations -- versus our original estimate for the year. And then we have some favorability in cash taxes and in working capital as compared to the model that we had at the beginning of the year.", "For MPS, their unlevered free cash flow for the fiscal year, the last fiscal year was almost $120 million. If you look at the trailing 12 months, at the end of September, it was around $100 million. It will contribute immediately when it becomes part of WestRock from a free cash flow point of view.", "Phil Ng", "I guess shifting gears to consumer, price had softened a bit during the quarter. How much of that was seasonal and contractual tied to PPW? Have you seen a bit more pressure on the export side of things? Thanks.", "Bob Feeser", "What we're seeing in the fourth -- in the last quarter was very consistent with what we had expected with the previously announced declines in consumer, so, very much in line with that. In the export market, continued price pressure related to the FX. But I would say over the last three months that has stabilized.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Brian Maguire", "Congratulations on the transaction and congratulations on your Falcons so far. I wanted to just dig into the synergies a little bit more. It looks about 40% or so. The $85 million is coming from paperboard integration.", "I think the logic makes sense there. But in some of these deals before, we had seen where the displaced incumbent gets a little bit more aggressive trying to place those tons that they have lost and you see some price erosion as a result. Do you think that could be the case here or are there any reasons why it might be a little bit unique and you wouldn't see some kind of a competitive reaction in the market?", "Bob Feeser", "We never know for certain what those second-order effects are going to be. But that's certainly something that we have taken into account as we thought through the synergy model. But certainly, the opportunity for us to integrate the volume is first and foremost important for our overall acquisition model. So that is what we will be working towards.", "Brian Maguire", "And then just wanted to follow-up, if I could, back on the consumer topic, I think there has been a price increase announcement out there in the market for CRB around $50 a ton. I just wondered if you guys are seeing the supply/demand balance supportive of that, recognizing that the whole industry has gotten some raw material inflation here. Are you guys seeing enough of a support out there to be able to get some of that price increase through to at least offset some of the raw inflation you've had?", "Bob Feeser", "It's still early to know for sure. Our backlogs have been stable through this period of time. What we can say, as you have already indicated, we're seeing significant cost inflation pressure across the Business. So it's -- we will have to wait and see how that plays out.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson from Keybanc. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Adam Josephson", "Best of luck with the transaction, Ward, just a question on the guidance, can you talk about what containerboard pricing benefits in terms of EBITDA that you are including in the FY '17 free cash flow guidance and how you're getting there? I think it's been, I think, the source of quite a bit of confusion among investors. So I'm hoping you can clear it up.", "Similarly, I know, Ward, you talked about cost inflation being at the high end of that $175 million to $200 million, if not even above that. Can you just talk about what your expectation is and what you're expecting for OCC, nat gas, diesel, et cetera, just so people know where you're coming from?", "Ward Dickson", "Well, I think we talked about the run rate that we would achieve, both in the quarter for the containerboard price increase, both domestically and in box, that we would be at the full run rate as we were exiting Q2. And that we would start to get the initial benefits related to the export price increase in our second quarter.", "For inflation, I am not going to quote a specific number. Again, it's above the high end of the range and it's highly dependent upon where OCC is going to be for the full year. That simply reinforces the need for us to achieve our productivity goals that we have across the Company.", "We generated over $80 million of productivity that fell through the bottom line in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. We're reiterating that we're going to exit the full year at the $800 million run rate on the $1 billion target. And it's -- what we have to do is we have to drive productivity to offset the negative impact of inflation.", "Adam Josephson", "And just one on the CRB increase, Bob, I know you just talked about it. But, Steve, you said before that containerboard pricing is really predicated on supply/demand. It sounds like you're saying, with the CRB increase, it's much more about cost inflation than supply/demand. So can you just talk about your thought process as it relates to announcing price increases and how much is dependent on supply/demand fundamentals versus cost inflation and when that differs?", "Steve Voorhees", "Okay. I'm going to let Bob handle that since he responded to the prior CRB question.", "Bob Feeser", "Adam, it's very situation dependent. By and large, as you know, it's a supply and demand-based business that we're in. However, in this situation with a significant increase in input costs, recycled fiber and energy, we believe that there is a need to recover those costs. In this case, that is what's largely driving this increase.", "Adam Josephson", "On the containerboard side, does it also differ situationally or is it really just supply/demand?", "Jeff Chalovich", "I think what Bob described is similar. It is situational.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from CLSA. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Mark Connelly", "Just one question, I want to come back to the organic growth question I asked last time. Most of what you have acquired since Smurfit-Stone has more organic growth potential than containerboard. As you diversify away from some of the core legacy carton markets, what do you think that's doing to your overall organic growth opportunity?", "Steve Voorhees", "I think it is improving it. MPS on markets, the healthcare and consumer markets, are growing faster than the rest of our markets. It is additive to our overall opportunity of growing the Business.", "Mark Connelly", "But is this acquisition telling us that you have less confidence in maybe the future growth outlooks for those core businesses and is this just partially just making up?", "Steve Voorhees", "No, I think it's adding to our core business; we look at our core business as being paper and packaging, serving both consumer and corrugated markets. This fits very nicely with and adds to, what we have. So I think it's entirely consistent with what we have been doing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Lars Kjellberg from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Lars Kjellberg", "Good luck with the MPS transaction. I just wanted to come back to that a bit, in terms of the synergies, the $85 million you talked about. MPS has had various operational issues and from various conference calls we've learned that they had an unusual amount of customer turnover, losses, et cetera. Is this the base we should [indiscernible] or do you anticipate in a recovery in the underlying business of MPS? And also if you want to comment a bit on MPS's strategy was certainly built on a bit of bolt-on strategy going forward. Is that something you see opportunities to continue? And then just have a follow-up question on the integration.", "Ward Dickson", "Lars, this is Ward. The MPS trailing 12-month EBITDA at the end of September was $237 million. They have not released their earnings for the second quarter, but they did give guidance for the EBITDA range that they had for the full year. The way that we're looking at the business, we're modeling both synergies and performance improvements in their business. So I think that as you look at the potential EBITDA generation, I think you can take the $237 million starting point and add the $85 million in synergies and that is the expectation that we're trying to drive as we exit 2019.", "Lars Kjellberg", "About bolt-on strategies -- is that something that you would like to continue?", "Steve Voorhees", "Yes, of course. That has been part of what has made MPS successful and that's going to continue to be an opportunity for us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Steve Powers", "Just a quick clarifying question, in case I missed it and I apologize if I did. But just in terms of the regulatory approval process on MPSX, I'm assuming U.S. and European approvals will be required, but what about China? Do you foresee any approval requirements in China? And if so, does that present any potential risk of delay in the process? Thank you.", "Steve Voorhees", "The regulatory approvals we think we need at this point are U.S., Mexico, European Union, Canada and China. It's early for us to comment on the outlook for that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover from Davidson. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Steve Chercover", "So it looks as if you have about 80,000 tons of upside in terms of integration. You're not currently selling a lot to MPS, is that correct?", "Steve Voorhees", "Yes. That is correct.", "Steve Chercover", "Okay. And then I wanted to take a different spin on the acquisition as a whole. Five years ago, the prevailing wisdom on the corrugated box plants was that there were way too many and now we're in a full-blown feeding frenzy to integrate. I'm wondering, do you see a similar trend emerging on folding cartons, where we've got a pretty consolidated supply side on the substrate, but the box plants are fragmented and you're trying to get moving on the integration. Is there a parallel here?", "Steve Voorhees", "That is difficult for me to comment on an overall industry basis. I think for this particular transaction, to me, the core reason for the transaction is MPS's position and the packaging business. I've told several people this in the process. Look at this as cake and icing. The core business and the packaging business is the cake. The integration is a nice addition. It is the icing to the transaction. Whether that holds true for the rest of the business and the industry, I can't speak to it. All I can say, this is a fantastic transaction for us and I am very much looking forward to getting it closed and working with the MPS management team.", "Steve Chercover", "Okay. Thanks, Steve.", "Matt Tractenberg", "Carol, I think that's going to do it for us today.", "Operator", "Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call.

Davidson", "Operator", "Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the WestRock Fiscal 2016 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This call will be an hour in duration. At this time, all phone participants will be on listen-only mode until the question and answer session of today's conference. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Steve Voorhees. Sir, you may begin.", "Steve Voorhees", "Good morning. Welcome to our conference call. I am Steve Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer. I am joined this morning by Ward Dickson, Chief Financial Officer; Jim Porter, President of our Paper Solutions business; and Bob Beckler, President of our Packaging Solutions business.", "During the course of the call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates, and beliefs related to future events. Statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discuss during the call.", "We described these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our 10-K for fiscal year ending September 30, 2015.", "We will refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the Appendix of the slide presentation, which is available on our website.", "Before we share the details about the quarter, I would like to comment on one of the questions I get asked most recently these days, how is the merger integration going. I am pleased to report the merger integration is going extremely well. I believe even more strongly today in this strategic rationale of the merger than I did when we announced the merger one year ago, we have the first or second leading positions in attractive global packaging markets and we are aggressively working to maximize the opportunities of the merger.", "We are improving operational efficiency across our organization. We are executing on making meaningful progress toward realizing $1 billion in synergy and performance improvement opportunities, culturally building an outstanding WestRock team that is aligned and focused on building the premier global packaging company.", "Our customers are very interested in using innovation to increase their sales and reducing their cost to increase their profitability. WestRock suite of paper packaging and merchandising products and services, across a multinational platform is enabling us to engage with customers in ways that no other company can.", "We are an integrated global packaging solutions provider and this is resonating with our customers. We are executing on our strategy and we are working all together while doing so. We are taking advantage of the opportunities to improve our business through our investment in people, assets and acquisitions.", "WestRock is a compelling value creation opportunity. We are well-positioned to deliver value for stockholders, we are strong believers in managing the business to generate cash, we have aligned our strategy and incentives to do just that.", "During our first six months of operation, we generated $609 million or $2.33 per share in free cash flow after adding back after tax cash, merger and integration-related restructuring cost. For this fiscal year, we expect to generate in the range of $950 million to $1 billion free cash flow or approximately $3.75 per share based on our current share account.", "We have demonstrated our commitment to returning capital to stockholders. We have repurchased $9.5 million shares over the past seven months and are paying an annual dividend of about $400 million.", "We intend to maintain our dividend after the spin of Specialty Chemicals. At yesterday's closing stock price, our current yield of 4.7% would increase over 5% after completion of the spin.", "Let us turn to the financial results for the quarter. WestRock sales for the quarter were $3.7 billion and adjusted earnings per share were $0.59.", "Our last 12 months' credit agreement EBITDA margin was 16.9%. These returns are largely in line with our expectations.", "Our Corrugated Packaging businesses performed well. The strong growth in bark sales in by sales in the United States, we have matched our supply with our customer demand. As a result, we have permanently closed three mills to shock in Newberg and Uncasville, with the total annual capacity of 675,000 tons.", "Our resilient corrugated packaging operations continue to perform exceptionally well. This business is providing great current returns and also providing attractive investment opportunities to improve our returns over the next several years.", "With added SP Fiber and Cenveo packaging businesses to our platform. We expect to complete our joint venture with Grupo Gondi during the first half calendar year 2016. All three transactions add to the strength of our business.", "We have repurchased 4.1 million shares of our common stock since November. To-date, we have bought back 9.5 million shares under our 40 million share repurchase authorization. We reassessed our valuation of Specialty Chemicals business in light of changing market conditions and financial performance and lower comparative market valuations for their peer group.", "We will reduce the estimated enterprise value of Specialty Chemicals business from the purchase accounting value recorded last July to approximately $1.6 billion.", "As a result, we have reported non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $478 million.", "We are making progress on the spin Ingevity. Earlier this month, we received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service; positively address each issue we needed to have addressed for the spin, including the removal additional limitations on WestRock stock repurchases.", "We anticipate completion of this spin by early May, later than previously announced, due to the inherent complexities of the separation process.", "The corrugated packaging team delivered outstanding results across our North American box business, with box shipments up 2.9% on a per day basis. Box prices were stable, sequentially. All regions of the United States did well, although we did have a slight decline in the West, principally due to a decline produce volumes.", "We had particularly strong performance in ecommerce. We shipped 530,000 tons to domestic and export markets, including approximately 280,000 tons to domestic markets and 250,000 to export market.", "Without SP Fiber, domestic shipments were 86,000 tons less than last year and our prices were essentially flat, sequentially, export channels continue to be price-competitive. Overall export pricing was down $9 per ton on a sequential quarter basis.", "We actively managed our system to meet our customer demand and took 264,000 tons of economic and maintenance downtime in the quarter. The incremental cost of the economic downturn was $11 million year-over-year. The closure of the Uncasville and Coshocton mills will reduce our annual operating costs by $25 million.", "The cumulative impact of these actions has balanced our containerboard system. We made solid gains in productivity with incremental contributions to pre-tax income of $36 million over the last year.", "Brazil continued to perform very well both, individually and compared to the rest of the Brazilian market, with EBITDA margins of 24.8%.", "The Tres Barras mill and our virgin fiber supply are competitive advantages in this market. WestRock's box shipments increased 1% compared to the prior year. This is significantly more than the overall market in Brazil, which declined by 5%.", "Turning to the consumer packaging segment, our adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.2% grew by 160 basis points over last year. This was driven by strong performance in our packaging businesses, overall stable consumer mill volumes, productivity gains and energy deflation.", "Pricing mix was stable for the quarter. External SBS volumes from our mill system were modestly down, largely related to the loss of our customer last year. Otherwise, we are seeing good growth in premium applications, including tobacco, commercial print and foodservice [ph].", "While the SBS market is challenged by slower demand and processed food applications, we are continuing to perform well across the diversified mix of end markets that we serve. We are seeing a small amount of foreign competition in more commodity portions of the market such as foodservice plate in general market. This has not had an appreciable impact on our business.", "In addition to external SBS sales, we are making good progress internalizing approximately 100,000 tons of incremental SBS production into our converting system from opportunities identified during the merger, the recent acquisition of Cenveo packaging businesses.", "Also in the quarter, we continued the integration of more than 150,000 tons of the Carolina commercial print business that we acquired last year. This production transitioned fully to our SBS system earlier this month. The net result of the gains and internal converting [ph] in the Carolina acquisition increased the loading and production efficiencies of our SBS mill system.", "The combined CNK and beverage packaging businesses deliver a good quarter as modest growth in global beer markets offset declines in carbonated soft drink volumes, particularly in North America.", "Our CRB mills operated well during the quarter. We have executed on the $50 per ton price increase announced last summer.", "With the Cenveo Packaging acquisition, we will internalize an additional 5,000 tons of CRB into our system. Our folding carton converting business continues to perform well. Volume growth exceeded that of the overall market. Pricing was slightly down as contract renewals were competitive and some food customers experienced declining volumes.", "Home, Health and Beauty, had a very good quarter with strong European volumes more than offsetting some weakness in North America. Margin continues to improve with good mix, cost management and productivity.", "Merchandising display sales declined due to lower promotional activity with key customers. The core business remains attractive and we are continuing to optimize the fixed cost structure of this business to improve profitability.", "Turning to specialty chemicals, depressed oil prices have reduced demand for oil field chemicals and certain industrial products. This has made competing petroleum-based chemistries more economical.", "Total sales during the quarter declined by $31 million compared to last year. Segment EBITDA of $32 million was a little more than half of last year's quarter. Segment profitability also reflected $8.5 million in outage and China start-up expenses.", "The December quarter is seasonally the softest quarter for this business. Ingevity annual revenues running at more than $900 million and adjusted EBITDA now at an annual rate of approximately $200 million. The oilfield services business is now less than 10% of annual revenue at approximately $80 million, so this business is relatively small as compared to the total business.", "We achieved record quarterly sales for activated carbon and asphalt additive products. We had good growth engines in the asphalt additives in automotive carbon, including the new automotive carbon plant that is starting up in China.", "We have a strong profitable business, a very strong management team and the scale with which to operate as a successful public company. The long-term fundamentals of the business are sound and it will make for a compelling growth equity story. ", "Post-spin Ingevity will have reasonable leverage at about 2.5 times EBITDA. This will provide an immediate cash inflow of approximately 400 million to WestRock at the time of the spin, plus funding an additional $80 million of security for a capital always retained by WestRock.", "Our land business results reflect a purchase price accounting step up of the assets to fair market value as of the July 1st merger. The step-up effectively removes what the anticipated development profit was at that time. This has no effect on cash flow, only on reported earnings.", "Most important thing to know about this segment is that we are operating in Charleston, one of the healthiest real estate markets in the country.", "We are looking at ways to monetize our portfolio faster than the normal development process would allow. We have already made some progress on certain projects and we expect to do more on this front. Over the last several months, we completed SP Fiber and Cenveo Packaging acquisitions with the total investment of approximately $400 million.", "Both SP Fiber and Cenveo Packaging are great strategic fits with our business and strategy. We believe these businesses will generate excellent returns on investment. We expect to complete the Grupo Gondi joint venture investment in the next couple of months.", "Mexico is a very important to our customers and to us, due to its proximity to the United States and a strong growth [ph]. We have been looking for a long time for the right opportunity to grow our capabilities in Mexico, and I believe that the partnership Grupo Gondi is the best way for WestRock to grown in Mexico.", "WestRock will contribute $175 million in cash and our three Mexican box pants, and Grupo Gondi will contribute their business.", "Based on current exchange rates in the last 12 months results, the joint venture on a pro forma basis has generated $670 million in sales and $135 million in EBITDA. Our box plants have generated about 10% to 15% of the $135 million.", "We will have a 25% interest in the joint venture joint venture and the joint venture will have net positive cash on its balance sheet when the joint venture is formed.", "The cash that we are contributing will be invested by the joint venture to support growth. WestRock will continue to provide the 200,000 ton that we have supplied to our three box plants and we will have continuing opportunities to supply additional tons as the joint venture grows.", "We are currently executing on the opportunity to supply 25,000 tons of kraftliner to Gondi that we were not supplying six ago.", "We will have the opportunity to build upon our combined relationships and capabilities to grow in the attractive paper and packaging markets of Mexico.", "Now, I will turn it over to Ward for additional details.", "Ward Dickson", "Thank you, Steve. Total non-allocated expenses were $4.5 million in the current quarter. We reduced corporate expenses by $21 million and this is included as part of our $250 million synergy and productivity performance.", "Our non-service pension income was $25 million lower than the $47 million reported last year. This was principally a result of our pension de-risking strategy, which was implemented to protect overfunded pension plan status.", "We reallocated our investments to lower return asset categories, which reduced our pension income. Our U.S. -qualified plan have $6.4 billion in assets. These are 108% funded and have lost very little value during the recent market disruptions.", "Our de-risking strategy made a lot of sense last summer and even more now. We are one of the few U.S. companies and the only one of our peers with an overfunded pension plan and we are careful to protect that value.", "We have a very disciplined approach to realizing our synergies and performance improvements across our businesses and functions. We are executing on the opportunities and projects to reach our $1 billion goal and on track to reach this target by the end of fiscal 2018.", "Our entire company is critically focused on delivering on and exceeding our goal. Work spans many areas; we are realizing procurement logistics savings using the power of the expanded size of our company to our advantage in purchasing around the world. We are benefiting from our comprehensive mill system, maximizing our ability to produce the right products in the right locations and in-sourcing paperboard throughout the system and we are continuing to use best practices from each former company to develop the right models and streamline our businesses and corporate functions across the Company.", "We continue to make capital investments in our mills and converting operations with projects that reduce cost. Based on the strength of these and other initiatives, we exited the quarter at an annualized run rate of more than $250 million and are on track to achieve at least $450 million by the end of fiscal 2016.", "Adjusted segment EBITDA declined $68 million, due primarily to the reductions in specialty chemicals, the land and development business and a reduction in pension income. Adjusted EBITDA of our core consumer corrugated packaging businesses and corporate expenses, excluding pension income increased by $15 million.", "During the quarter, we generated $88 million in productivity, which demonstrates our continued focus on progress in this area. Our productivity more than offsets the negative impact of volume, price and other negative market factors. We continue to benefit from deflation in key energy categories.", "Before turning it back to Steve, I want to take a minute to discuss our cash flow outlook and assumptions.", "We generate significant cash flow and that is likely the key metrics that has not been fully appreciated in this stock market. For fiscal 2016, we are forecasting cash flow provided by operations of between $1.8 billion and $1.825 billion, and capital expenditures in the range of $825 million to $850 million.", "As Steve reported, our net free cash flow should be in the range of $950 million to $1 billion. We are including Ingevity's results in this outlook for the seven-month period that they will be part of WestRock, and they will be excluded for the remaining five months. However, Ingevity's operating cash flow is equal to the forecasted capital expenditures for the period as they are finishing their growth initiatives in China and Brazil and the winter is their seasonally slower time of the year.", "Our outlook reflects a view on the impact of recent PPW price changes in our corrugated packaging segment. Looking into the March quarter, there is a lot to be excited about in our business as we continue to execute on our strategy.", "From a financial standpoint, there are more seasonal headwinds in the March quarter on a sequential basis. We will have more energy usage due to the winter weather and we will have some impact from the recent snowstorm that blanketed much of the Northeast. Wood will be more expensive than in the December quarter. In addition, the labor cost pool also resets with annual salary increases beginning as well as the new year of employment-related taxes.", "The mart [ph] mill is undergoing a major maintenance outage in March that will have a $10 million impact on income in the quarter. In the corrugated business, export pricing will likely continue with some softening in pricing.", "Currencies will also likely have some negative impact on the quarter. We will continue to deliver on our productivity and synergy, improvement program, which is creating a lot of value. When all of this is taken into account, we expect that the March quarter will be lower on an adjusted EPS as compared to the $0.59 posted in December.", "I will now turn the call back over to Steve.", "Steve Voorhees", "Thanks Ward. Before I open the call for questions, let me summarize by saying, we are very pleased with our solid execution and the progress we have made and continue to make toward building the premier global packaging company.", "Today, we have leading positions in our markets; we are expanding our customer relationships through a comprehensive offering across a broad geographic footprint. We are realizing the strategic benefits of merger and remain on track towards achieving our productivity improvements targets.", "We are confident in our ability to successfully execute our growth strategy and generate strong cash flow, enabling us to deliver value for our stockholders and customers.", "With that, we are pleased to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session of today's conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Mr. George Staphos, sir your line is now opened.", "George Staphos", "Hi, everyone. Thanks for the details and for taking our question. My two questions will be to extent you can comment around cash flow EBITDA. If we assume no changes in prices going forward, because obviously you can't do that, when we rework the free cash flow guidance, we would get EBITDA somewhere in the range of about $2.1 billion. Is there a way that you could comment to whether that is a reasonable forecast at this juncture? If not, can you remind us of any other a large cash items we should be thinking about, cash interest, cash taxes that you did not show on Slide 14?", "Steve Voorhees", "Yes. George. I am going to let Ward respond to that.", "George Staphos", "Thank you.", "Ward Dickson", "George thank you. Again, what we provided was free cash flow guidance of $950 million to a $1 billion. We also included the pension post-retirement funding. Working capital assumptions in our book tax rate of 34% to 36%.", "The other thing to consider, the D&A. We had million $294 million of D&A in the quarter Ingevity is about $7 million to $8 million a month, so we will have the D&A for them for the remaining through the seven-month period.", "Cash taxes will be less than book. Share based comp will be a source, equity and income and unconsolidated affiliates with the investment in Gondi will actually be a use. These and other balance sheet item over the course of the year should generate between zero and $25 million of source.", "George Staphos", "Okay.", "Ward Dickson", "\u2026for the remainder of the year.", "George Staphos", "All right. Ward, thanks for that. Then I guess my other question - I appreciate all the detail. I am going to just the outlook. Can you any commented all in terms of how bookings have been thus far in the quarter, just you know an overall comment about how the corrugated markets in particular have been early in the fiscal 2Q. Thank you very much.", "Steve Voorhees", "Jim?", "Jim Porter", "Good morning, George. Jim Porter.", "George Staphos", "Hey, Jim.", "Jim Porter", "First, I would like to highlight how excited I am about the progress at our corrugated container business has made and just continue to make progress in so many areas. The investment that we have made in our people and processes and capital equipment improvements, have really given us exceptional quality and service for our customers that is being rewarded by increased business and I highlight that with, we have 12 months in a row in which our box shipments have exceeded the FBA industry, so we are quite proud of the progress being made.", "This last quarter, we were up 2.9% on a per day basis and that demand continues to be strong. Now after 12 month of exceptional growth, we are going to be entering a period, where the comps are getting tougher, but current demand as evidenced by our backlogs continues to be strong.", "Now, as Steve mentioned, we have had some weather events to start January, that will probably put a dent in those numbers, but we expect that by the end of the quarter we should be flat on a year-over-year basis.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mr. Mark Weintraub of Buckingham Research. Sir, your line is now open.", "Mark Weintraub", "Thank you. I wanted to just to follow, Steve, you had mentioned that $950 million to $1 billion of free cash flow on a per share basis, where the share count today is 375, but of course you do have the share repurchase authorization in place for an additional 35-plus million shares and given the cash flow, given the dividend that comes in from Ingevity, given that you are below your targeted cap [ph], presumably you are in a position to act fairly aggressively and perhaps expeditiously on that share repurchase and I was hoping to get a sense as to what your thoughts on the timing might be and just to throw in there is a part of the question is, when the share repurchase program was originally authorized, the stock was North of 60. Now it is closer to the 30. Were you conceiving of the repurchase as the dollar amount conceptually internally or as a number of shares, and given that the - if share price were to stay at this bargain basement level, would you potentially be in a position to buyback even more over time?", "Steve Voorhees", "Mark, when we announced merger, we had our balanced capital allocation strategy when we had the authorization for 40 million shares. I feel like we follow through on that very well with the purchase of 9.5 million shares.", "When I think about balanced capital allocation, I look at the opportunities that we have to invest in our business, make acquisitions and buy back stock, and I will tell you based on the current price, the share buyback has risen in attractiveness to us.", "Just the cash flow that we have, the dividend that we pay, it is attractive for us to buy back stock. With respect to aggressive or timing, I think we will see how the quarter goes. I can't really speak to exact on timing, but I will tell you the buyback is much more attractive than it was when the price was higher.", "Mark Weintraub", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mr. Mark Wilde of BMO Capital. Sir, your line is now open.", "Mark Wilde", "Good morning, Steve. Good morning, Ward.", "Steve Voorhees", "Good morning, Mark.", "Mark Wilde", "Just to follow-on Mark's question, would you consider an accelerated repurchase programs just to take advantage of stock of $31 to $32 a share?", "Steve Voorhees", "We have considered that I think as we have gone along and advice we have got and it is not the most efficient way to buy back stock. We have been able to buy 9.5 million shares without an accelerated share repurchase, so like never say never, but when consider to, we included the open market purchase routes and more efficient way for us to buy back stock.", "Mark Wilde", "Okay. Then the other question I had is just on the boxboard market. I wondered, Jim Porter, if you can give us kind of an update on kind of global boxboard markets across all three of your substrates. I guess we are thinking about new capacity over in Europe, but also what affect all of that Chinese capacity is having in global markets around the world. It sounds like we are even seeing some of that coming to the U.S.", "Steve Voorhees", "Good morning, Mark. I am going to have Bob Beckler take the lead on that and I will piggyback as necessary.", "Bob Beckler", "Hi, Mark.", "Mark Wilde", "Hi, Bob.", "Bob Beckler", "Yes. Let me just do a quick run through starting with CRB and CNK, where backlogs are up from a year-on-year standpoint. Although, sequentially, we have seen some expected using that is really seasonality. Overall, we are in good balance from a supply and demand standpoint and the markets are generally stable.", "On SBS, the demand that we are seeing in the higher end premium markets, where we concentrate our efforts has been stable to up slightly and that is a global statement. Backlogs are s stable and pricing is stable.", "Considering the internalization that Steve mentioned in his opening comments, which came from opportunities that the merger created to the recent acquisition of the Cenveo packaging business to the acquisition last year of the Carolina commercial print business, this brings a lot of SBS into our system that we are now producing internally, so in terms of near-term outlook will be up solidly.", "Now, specific to Europe, what we see there is imports are attempting to penetrate, primarily in the more commodity end of the market. Such as general markets and foodservice plate stock, where we have less of a position, so in terms of direct impact for us, it has really been zero out of euro.", "Then in terms of Chinese imports, which I believe was your question. Again, we are not seeing a significant impact there. The hurdles are fairly high at this stage for competition on that front. We have an advantage cost position. Again, we focus on a very diverse range of higher end markets. We have the quality advantage and not to mention there is a very high hurdle rate around the very complex supply chain that exist. It is a very complicated market to serve with very demanding customers service requirements that we are well-positioned, so net-net, not much effect that we are seeing from an import standpoint.", "Mark Wilde", "Okay. Is it possible to get any color? You have mentioned the loss of a key customer in the third quarter last year. I do not recall hearing about that before. Can you just quantify that for us and give us maybe a little bit of color?", "Steve Voorhees", "Yes. Mark that was one specific customer, in our liquid packaging sector that occurred about the seven or eight months ago. ", "Just add to the comment, we are obviously offsetting that with the lose that I outlined earlier and continued modest growth in the premium sectors that we that we focus on such as tobacco, foodservice, cup stock and commercial print.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mr. Scott Gaffner of Barclays. Sir, your line is now open.", "Scott Gaffner", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Steve Voorhees", "Good morning, Scott.", "Scott Gaffner", "Hi. Steve. I just wanted to go back for a minute to the SP Fiber acquisition, because you know, since then you have closed about 675,000 tons capacity and you had a couple of key comments here in the presentation on the rationale for that acquisition, but can you just maybe go a little bit deeper on what exactly SP Fiber provide maybe from a product portfolio perspective that you did not have before or couldn't get by investing in your own system?", "Steve Voorhees", "Jim?", "Jim Porter", "Yes. I will take that Steve. First of all, we are really excited about the opportunity to have acquired the SP assets, specifically the Dublin, Georgia mill. I think the proposition goes back to how we look at our markets and in our quest to improve the cost of the system, but you have seen us behave consistently in a way that we matched our supply with demand. Then over the last number of quarters, we have tried to balance our system through a combination of temporary shutdowns slow backs and permanent closures to get our system in just the right balance with our demand.", "The acquisition of SP Fiber in October gave us the capability to add $575,000 tons of really excellent quality, low-cost, lightweight packaging great papers in the center of our neural network of supply chain, so that gave us the ability to build a very granular plan in order to improve the cost structure and service capability of our system, so that allowed us to first permanently close the Coshocton mill in November.", "Secondly, to close permanently the Newberg, newsprint and packaging great mill in mid-November and our latest move to close Uncasville, medium mill, which will be permanently shut by January 31, so this acquisition has given us the ability to provide a very good quality market demand substrates in a lower cost both, fixed and operating and has allowed us to balance supply with demand in a much more efficient way taking 675,000 tons out of the market, so I hope that gives clarity to our move.", "Scott Gaffner", "That is great. Steve, just following up on that, since you have done the merger, you did the two acquisitions SP Fiber, Cenveo, also the JV, obviously, acquisitions have been a key part of the WestRock going back to the RockTenn story historically. Do you see that continuing going forward? Are you reaching sort of maximum capacity as far as - I mean, obviously not from a leverage perspective, but from a management bandwidth perspective to keep doing these smaller bolt-on acquisitions or should we see them continue at this pace going forward?", "Steve Voorhees", "I think it is a function of priorities. If you look at the opportunity set that we have, we have an incredible opportunity to operate our businesses even better than they have. We have a lot of opportunity to bring more money to the bottom-line through a focus on our own business, so when I look at our priorities, I think, acquisitions is probably less of a relative priority than it might have been in the past, because of the opportunities we have to combine our organizations and go-to-market and operate even more efficiently. I think internal focus is probably a relatively greater priority than it would have been to me previously.", "Now, having said that, the acquisitions that we have made I think have been strategic and been helpful to our business, so we will continue to look at them, I just do not see them as, in response to your question, as high priorities might have been in the past.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chip Dillon of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.", "Chip Dillon", "Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. I think, the first thing I think the previous questioner had said, 275 million shares. I just want to clarify your 257. At least, you are on average in the quarter, is that right? Hello?", "Steve Voorhees", "Yes. Could you repeat the question, Chip?", "Chip Dillon", "Yes. I just wanted to clarify that share count was 257 million, not 275. At least that was the average, I think in the press release.", "Steve Voorhees", "Yes. It was 257. Yes. I got it now that was 257. I think it different - basic and diluted shares.", "Chip Dillon", "Okay. Thanks guys. I just wanted to clarify that. I guess this is either for Jim are Steve. Could you just let us know as you look at your box situation in the United States, I would assume and what I have always been told is that where you do have index contracts, the analysts [ph] are totally tied to I guess that we see pulp and paper weak kraftliner price as opposed to some of the other you know recycled grade as they track. Is that still fair for your company?", "Steve Voorhees", "Yes.", "Chip Dillon", "Okay. Were you all surprised by the action they took last weekend or what did you think of that?", "Steve Voorhees", "I would say, everybody was surprised, including us. I think Jim is going to comment more on that.", "Jim Porter", "Good morning, Chip. I would have to say yes. We were very surprised to see specifically linerboard and white top linerboard published down by $15. We simply have not seen virgin containerboard down in the market. We have seen and heard of customers discounting some of the smaller recycled principally medium volume in the market.", "However, our linerboard and white top has not been dropped and those factor supported by the fact that our domestic containerboard prices, excluding the addition of the recent SP mill, which we are fitting into our system has been flat year-over-year and flat, sequentially, so we are just simply not seeing that price drop, particularly in the virgin grade, so we were very surprised by that.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mr. Anthony Pettinari of Citigroup. Sir, your line is now open.", "Anthony Pettinari", "Good morning. Following the mill closures and the acquisitions, a lot of moving pieces, is it possible to share what your containerboard integration rate is and is there a rate that you think is sort of an optimal integration level for WestRock or is that not how you think about improving margins. Just if you could give any color there.", "Steve Voorhees", "We are currently in the range of in the high 60s, 67% to 69% integration within our corrugated system and we certainly do look at that. We think about our round number is 8 million ton containerboard business through three channels.", "One is our outstanding domestic corrugated packaging business, which we have seen growing and their capability to penetrate the market. We then see the North American domestic sales and then the international sales.", "When we look at how we maximize our portfolio of product and margin through those channels and the integrated corrugated box segment is one that is attracted to us and we will look for continued growth through organic means and certainly we look at acquisitions. They have been pretty price-related.", "Steve Voorhees", "Just in terms of priority, the best thing we can do for the corrugated packaging business is sell more boxes and that is exactly what we have been doing over the past several years. We have invested in capital, people, processes. I think, that team has just done, in my view an outstanding job for a long period of time showing up in the results.", "Anthony Pettinari", "Okay. That is helpful. Then just with Ingevity, you know, you mentioned complexities that are pushing the spinout a bit. Could you give any color there? I mean, are those issues related to the transaction that are taking a little bit more time than you expected or is it kind of choppiness in the capital markets or the complexities of separating the assets, just wondering if you could give any color there.", "Complexities are by nature of complex. If I had to pick one, which was I guess a little bit surprising to me, it is the step plan to put everything in place with a number of foreign entities in the U.S. I think that has just required a lot thought. There was a lot tax implication to that, so if I had to pick, that would be it, but there is several of them.", "Anthony Pettinari", "Okay. That is helpful and maybe just one last one. ", "Anthony Pettinari", "Okay. That is helpful. Maybe just one last one. Regarding the mill closures, do you have to build inventories at sister mills in advanced of the closures to give yourself a little buffer or how does the closure sort of impact your inventory levels maybe over the next three months?", "Steve Voorhees", "Inventories are something that we very granularly manage for the on-time delivery and services required by both, our internal and external customers to meet their demands. Then we have seen over the past couple of years that we are benefitted by generally increasing our standard levels of inventory. This take big dividends and our ability to serve our corrugated box customers.", "As we think about inventories, particularly with down time season, we do build volume. While we have just gone through a sequential decline in our internal inventories, you will see us building somewhere in the 90,000 ton range over the next couple of months, which will then be absorbed by our annual shutdown schedule. When you get to the end of the fiscal year, we should be back at par with our standard inventory levels, so that is how we look at our system.", "Anthony Pettinari", "Okay. That is very helpful. I will turn it over.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Ms. Debbie Jones of Deutsche Bank. Ma'am, your line is now open.", "Debbie Jones", "Hi. Good morning.", "Steve Voorhees", "Hi, Debbie.", "Debbie Jones", "I wanted to turn to Brazil for second. You have a great assets down there. I think that there has been a lot of focus on your options in the U.S., but could you talk about your strategy going forward there and also just kind of characterize how you see the market?", "Steve Voorhees", "I am going to start and I will let Jim to chime in. I think Brazil is just a tremendous business for us. It shows up in the financial results. We implemented a project few years ago, which has really put Brazil on a great track and we have a number of options to be able to improve the business over time through capital investment. I think we are looking at that both internally in Brazil to get larger in the box business in Brazil, so I think market in Brazil have the opportunity to kind of add that to our system, if you will, to sort of exports markets. Jim?", "Jim Porter", "Yes. Steve, you covered it well. The only thing I would add is emphasis on the fact that we will have a great business in Brazil, and those investments have really paid off over time. That team is extraordinary in their ability to manage within a very difficult market conditions, but they really have premium assets. Our significant force resource give us a real competitive advantage in that region. We have one of the most modern virgin containerboard mills in the world at the Tres Barras facility that produces an extraordinary product that give us competitive advantage.", "Our box system is capable of integrating that volume to penetrate the marketplace. In the way, as we reported that has grown far in excess of the local economy, and because of the currency you have seen us increasing our export volumes out of that region, which are certainly advantaged in the global markets today, so we are quite bullish on our capability to serve and grow in that region.", "Debbie Jones", "Okay. Thank you for that. If I could just ask one follow-up, on your synergy and performance target just for the year, I think you took that out from 450 from 400. Can you just confirm that, and then what would the delta represent?", "Ward Dickson", "Debbie, this is Ward. Yes, we did do that and the driver has been the acceleration of some of the procurement savings. We are also going to have the benefit of some of the mill closures that we discussed as well and their impact on reducing costs.", "Debbie Jones", "Okay. Thanks. I will turn it over.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mr. Chris Manuel of Wells Fargo Securities. Sir, your line is now open.", "Chris Manuel", "Good morning, gentlemen. A couple of quick clarification questions and then one kind of new topic. The quick clarification questions, when you referred to the upper 60 utilization, 67 to 69, does that include - can I think about the tons you closed I guess they are mostly out now, but what you are viewing is the upside opportunities from Grupo Gondi putting extra in there and some of the other elements of the utilization rate you run today. I guess, what I am trying to get a sense of is to where that could go potentially with extra tons you bring in-house, integration?", "Steve Voorhees", "I do not know that I want to put a forecast number out there. The number I gave you is really the zone that we are operating in when we look at our internal North American containerboard system supply with our internal North American container system box shipment, so that is really the math on that.", "Certainly over time, as I said earlier, we look at channel optimization and our box system is attractive place for our containerboard to flow.", "Chris Manuel", "The second topic I wanted to actually discuss was on inflation side, so you are running at about - you have given us some run rate, where you are working through 250 on the run rate moving higher through the end of the year. What do you think inflation looks like this year? I mean, you have got some puts and takes, you have labors obviously moving higher, you had some help on a few of the other input elements energy et cetera, but what do you think for fiscal year, what is your inflation kind of shakes out at?", "Ward Dickson", "Yes. This is Ward. Clearly, we are getting the benefits year-over-year in the first quarter on the decline in primarily the energy-related input costs. The wage and benefit inflation is very predictable and will flow as we have laid out and you have seen the quarterly profile of it.", "As we start to get out into the second half of the year, I think our projections on a year-over-year basis is that they moderate. We do not get as much of the benefit because of the declines that took place in the second half of the last year. The one wildcard for us as we look out that far is what do we think the trends will be for OCC and recycled fiber.", "Chris Manuel", "Okay. I guess it is not going to chew up all [ph] over with your savings, but I mean we ballpark can say it is half of it or two-thirds of it. You can end up keeping same, because it is a little bit low on an inflation year that way or - just try to give us a sense of sense as to how to quantify it?", "Steve Voorhees", "It will clearly be less than the productivity that we generate, but it will be a component of the P&L, which includes obviously pricing and mix, foreign exchange and volumes.", "Chris Manuel", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Mr. Adam Josephson of KeyBanc. Sir, your line is now open.", "Adam Josephson", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone.", "Steve Voorhees", "Hi, Adam.", "Ward Dickson", "Hi, Adam.", "Adam Josephson", "Steve, you talked about the three containerboard mill shuts having balanced your system, so should I interpret that to me and that you are finished with the mill closures for the time being?", "Steve Voorhees", "Yes.", "Adam Josephson", "Okay. In terms of the - we see price reduction, can you quantify or perhaps the impact, the expected impact on your EBIT this fiscal year?", "Steve Voorhees", "When we gave you the cash flow guidance, we said that we reflected the PPW movement in that guidance. In fact, we updated all the assumptions that we have volumes, price, inflation and our realization of productivity. There are so many moving parts with 15,000 customers and agreements that we have that, I think, we are comfortable with our overall cash flow model, but we are not going to speak specifically to pricing and market movements that affect our customers more specifically.", "Adam Josephson", "Sure. One more on that free cash flow guidance. I know you said earlier, you expect cash taxes to be below book. Can you help us just with what you expect the cash tax rate to be versus the book rate in '16 and beyond '16 for that matter?", "Steve Voorhees", "In '16, it will be I think mid-to-high 20s. Then as we move into '17, I think, book and the cash will start to converge.", "Adam Josephson", "Thanks. Just one last one Ward. In terms of the seasonality of your business, obviously given that this is a new company, if I look at consumer packaging in fiscal '15, EBITDA in the second quarter was down quite a bit, sequentially, from the first quarter and then 3Q and 4Q are substantially higher than the first two quarters. Is that normal or what should we expect in terms of the seasonality of that business and why? Thank you.", "Ward Dickson", "In both businesses, I mean, we talked about the fact that we have higher energy costs. In the winter periods, we also have the impact of the reset of inflation, wages increases and the reset of payroll taxes as we moved from quarter-to-quarter. Clearly, our volume start to ramp up in the second half of the year in both businesses.", "Adam Josephson", "Thanks a lot, Ward.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Mr. Mark Connelly of CLSA. Sir, your line is now open.", "Mark Connelly", "Thank you. Steve, you have pushed back the timing of Specialty Chemical, but what is the rush? I mean, we have certainly seen another big chemical business spun recently when it was down and the shareholder situation did not turn out really well. I guess, I am just wondering, how do you figure the balance between the desire to clean up the portfolio quickly and the need to protect shareholder in such an uncertain market.", "Steve Voorhees", "I am glad you ask that question, because we have gone through and done, I think, a fair amount of thinking about that question ourselves. I think I start with we are a paper and packaging company. We are not a specialty chemicals business, so the business does not really fit with our portfolio.", "We have put in place, I think, a very strong management team and the business is going to perform better on its own than it would be as part of the WestRock.", "I think you can go through the alternatives, and I think the spend it makes the most sense. You could say, well maybe I could look at some other alternative, but we just think this is for the shareholders and for WestRock, obviously most effective thing for us to do. I think going to May, I think, is going to help the team get off to a good start and they are going to all put together, I think, a very compelling story for investors the value of Ingevity.", "Mark Connelly", "Okay. Just one more question, Steve. Will WestRock significantly realign the product development priorities within the consumer division? You say you are going to be integrated packaging company, but perfumes spritzers and one care dispensing. I mean, where do you draw the line?", "Steve Voorhees", "We are going through that now. We have innovations, primarily capability of WestRock. We have extremely talented people in the organization to be able to do that and I think we are going to be customer and market-driven, so we will take the guide from our customers to match with our capabilities and prioritize that one.", "Mark Connelly", "Okay. Thank you.", "Steve Voorhees", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Mr. Phil Ng of Jefferies. Sir, your line is now open.", "Phil Ng", "Hey, good morning, guys. The question for Ward, I think since your Ingevity business, you are owning it up to May, most of that cash flow is generated in the last five months of the year. What would your free cash look like if you owned it for the full year. I guess ask differently, how is your free cash flow. Is your free cash flow guidance a pretty good proxy for or what WestRock core would generate? Thanks.", "Ward Dickson", "I think the easiest answer is yes. Our free cash flow guidance is a good proxy for the core WestRock post-event.", "Phil Ng", "Okay. That is pretty impressive. That imply s 14%-type free cash flow yield here. Okay. Then I guess switching gears a little bit, perhaps the question for Jim. You guys have done a fair amount of heavy lifting in terms of closing three paper mills here.", "Did you need to take any more down time going forward, just what is your view on the broader market and can you provide a sense how demand is going to look for the full year. You provided some color in the first quarter?", "Jim Porter", "We have done a fair amount of very granular planning on how we improve the portfolio of our assets. Through all those moves, we have put our system in excellent balance and reduced our cost structure and we like our system where we are right now. We think we are poised to supply the market in a very efficient manner and we see generally a trend line of improving demand both, globally and in North America in our products, so we continue to be very bullish on our business.", "Phil Ng", "Okay, so you would expect demand just from a year-over-year perspective to firm up over the course of the year, because you said flattish-type volumes in the fiscal 2Q?", "Steve Voorhees", "I would.", "Phil Ng", "Okay. Just one last one for me. I know merchandizing display has been lower weak. Can you talk about how trends are shaking out there and if some of the operational issues you guys had last year has passed at this point? Thanks.", "Steve Voorhees", "The operational issues are past. I think, what we reported is promotional activity is down and promotional activity is by definition hard to predict, so we like to display businesses part of our portfolio, provides us a great entr\u00e9e and great capability to help us work with our customers, so it is I like the business, I would like to see if there are being more promotional activity and I think that will come.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mr. Steve Chercover of D.A. Davidson. Sir, your line is now open.", "Steve Chercover", "Thank you. Good morning. Two quick one. First, I am wondering how corrugated and consumer packaging complement one another. Have you gained new customers on either side from customers looking for a one-stop-shop?", "Bob Beckler", "Steve, this is Bob Beckler. Great question. It is just one of the benefits of the merger that we are continuing to realize and gain momentum.", "Within the largest customers of WestRock, there is overlap between our packaging lines of business, and in some cases packaging and paper board. It is substantial. The number, I think, we included in one of our slides is that our top $2 billion of customers participate in multiple product lines, and if you just take those customers with the upside that we see from an addressable market standpoint, we could see an additional $1 billion of opportunity just in that customers set, so it is still work in progress, but customers are definitely recognizing the benefits of, you call it a one-stop-shop, but it is really unique in the global industry to have these many capabilities under one roof.", "Steve Chercover", "Do they ask for a packaged deal? No pun intended?", "Bob Beckler", "No. We are really not seeing that as much as opportunities to enter into other products that they have. I think, if your question is are they trying to leverage that to their advantage, not so much that versus how can they increase their ease of doing business - complexity in their own supply change.", "Steve Voorhees", "I will just add. I am Steve. There is a gradation between corrugated and customer, the folding carton becomes micro fluid, become free print and often times the buyers were trying to choose between folding cartons and corrugated and we are just ideally position to help them work through those issues, because we are just understood and helping our customers be successful and we can do that more effectively with the broad product line without a bias on one substrait, one particular type of package.", "Steve Chercover", "Then I want to take one more stab at marking Mark's question. If you wanted to buy more than 40 million shares, do you have to go back to the Board for authorization?", "Steve Voorhees", "The answer is, yes.", "Steve Chercover", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Steve Voorhees", "Okay. I think we have completed the hour, so I just want to take the time to thank you for your time and attention. I think, we are making great progress in executing our plan to create value. We are growing our business, generating strong cash flow and realizing our synergies and performance improvements. I like what we are doing by expanding our customer relationships based on the breadth of our product offerings, we are using our capital to grow and invest in our business and return cash to stockholders.", "I think WestRock is a compelling value creating opportunity, and I thank you again for joining us this morning.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Jason Thompson. Please go ahead.", "Jason Thompson", "Thanks, Toni. And good morning, everyone.", "Before the market opened, we announced that MWV's income from continuing operations in the second quarter was $67 million or $0.37 per share. John Luke, Jim Buzzard and Mark Rajkowski are here to discuss these results in detail.", "Before we do that, just to remind you that the notification for this call was broadly disclosed and it is also being webcast at mwv.com where slides are also available. Our results and commentary are presented on a continuing operations basis and are correct as of today but could include time-sensitive information that is subject to change. In addition, any statements that are forward-looking are subject to known and unknown risks and are not guarantees of future performance.", "I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Luke.", "John A. Luke", "Jason, thanks very much. And good morning.", "In both our initial outlook and subsequent pre-announcement, we set expectations for lower performance in the second quarter largely due to operational issues stemming principally from an extended outage at our Covington mill. In commenting on our performance for the quarter, I'd highlight the following: First, the Covington operational challenges are now behind us. Second, we generated bottom line benefits from our cost-reduction activities and the investments we've made to improve returns, most particularly our expansion in Brazil, at Rigesa. Third, we doubled our cash flow from operating activities compared to the second quarter last year. And fourth, we drove continuing commercial progress in our markets consistent with our profitable growth strategies. With the rest of our presentation today, we'll elaborate on each of these areas. Jim will talk at greater length about the impact of the outage at Covington and other operational issues during the second quarter, which adversely impacted our Food & Beverage segment by about $35 million.", "We're off to a good start with our overhead cost reductions. Mark will talk about our progress in more detail. The impact was measurable in the first half and will strengthen in the second half of the year. Further, the big projects that will contribute to better growth and productivity going forward, especially the mill investments in Brazil and the new biomass boiler at Covington, are on-track, and we're beginning to see some of the earnings and cash benefits in Brazil already. These benefits and lower working capital levels led to the significant improvement in cash flow during the quarter.", "Despite the adverse impact of the operational challenges, our underlying business performance during the second quarter continued to improve. We had good commercial progress and share gains, notably in markets for food packaging, beverage multi-packs, medical dispensers and our personal care solutions. Overall, we grew our top line by 1% in the second quarter even as the uncertain macroeconomic environment trended lower -- toward lower global growth.", "GDP estimates in many countries, especially across Europe and key emerging markets, have been revised downward, and political, social and economic instability exists in many regions. Because of this weakening macroeconomic backdrop, we are even more focused on our strategies for profitable growth, including innovation, commercial excellence, emerging markets and expanded participation. A good example of these strategies coming together is the pump-on-tube dispensing solution we recently launched with a major skin care brand donor in India. This progress represents all of the things we're focusing on across the portfolio, bringing together our R&D capabilities with deep market knowledge and close partnerships with key customers especially in a market like personal care in India, which is growing at an annual rate upwards of 9%. We also made good progress during the quarter on the process we announced in April to explore alternatives for our land management business. The recent activity in that segment, as well as the market conditions in the Charleston region, have only strengthened the value we expect to deliver through this process.", "In short, we're generating continued growth in our markets with our strategies. We expect this momentum, along with the continued success in Brazil, to provide leverage in the second half of the year.", "I'll now turn it to Jim for commentary about our performance in each segment. Jim?", "James A. Buzzard", "Thank you, John.", "Our earnings performance in the second quarter was negatively impacted by the major cold outage and related productivity issues, as well as by the implementation of a new order management system. Our commercial performance was solid throughout the quarter, and our overall results returned to more normal levels once we had resolved the challenges at Covington.", "Beyond the issues that drove the $35 million negative impact on our Food & Beverage segment, the rest of our business performed relatively well, with strong volume gains in targeted consumer packaging markets, increased pricing in our Industrial business in Brazil and continued penetration of the highest-value markets for our Specialty Chemicals. We believe the commercial, operating and overall business performance momentum we had at the end of the second quarter is a good indicator for the stronger earnings and cash flow we've been anticipating in the second half of the year.", "Now I'll provide some more detail about performance in each of our segments. In the Food & Beverage segment, the negative impact of the Covington cold outage and system implementation pulled earnings well below last year's level. We are confident these issues are behind us, and the mills are now running well and supported by relatively strong demand.", "In the broad markets we serve in this segment, some modest easing of food shelf prices and our end user market focus led to higher volumes for us, while soft drinks and beer continued to be challenged especially in Europe and North America. We continue to do well with market-leading food customers and brand owners across frozen food, dry food and bakery categories, as well as club store packaging where our paperboard solutions are replacing some corrugated alternatives.", "In beverage, our multi-pack solutions are doing well in spite of a very tough market in which carbonated soft drinks continued to show volume weakness. Our overall carton sales were even with last year's performance. And we saw significant increases with leading brand owners in North America, Asia and Latin America where our sales were up 2%, 7% and 6%, respectively. These carton volume sales, in part, came from the machines we've placed with global customers over the past few years. And our pipeline of machinery orders is very strong for the next 6 months, which will keep the cycle trending in our favor.", "In both food and beverage markets, Europe continues to be a weak spot in the market and in our results, with record unemployment levels and poor weather having a significant negative impact on the category.", "Overall, our paperboard shipments were strong, with bleached board volume up 9% and Coated Natural Kraft volume up 1%, both largely driven by sales to food brand owners and their converting partners. Somewhat-lower pricing was driven by an unfavorable product mix in our continued ramp-up with a new product for an important food service customer.", "In the third quarter, we expect segment profits to be in line with last year's very strong performance. Backlogs remained strong at 6 to 7 weeks, and we will run full for the quarter with no major planned maintenance or outages. We are gaining momentum with our ongoing pricing initiatives and expect higher volume and productivity to be the principal drivers of our performance, which we expect to improve compared to the second quarter.", "The Home, Health & Beauty markets also reflected some weakness, primarily in the lawn, garden and auto categories that were impacted by unusually cold and wet weather in North America. The strong season for these products never materialized, and as a result, overall market volume was down about 20% compared to last year. In addition to this market's softness, we also saw lower volumes as we managed through customer transitions associated with the launch of our next-generation trigger sprayers in the North American market. We offset some of the impact in our home and garden business with strong performances in healthcare and personal care, both of which had high-single-digit revenue growth in the quarter.", "In healthcare, our medical pumps continued to perform well in Europe, and our adherence packaging business gained momentum with both retailers and branded pharmaceutical manufacturers who are looking to launch new drugs in our packaging. This is an exciting development for the business complementing the strength we have developed in the retail channel and clinical trials with new commercial launches of branded prescription drugs.", "In personal care, sales of pumps and dispensers for the global fragrance, skin care and cosmetics markets were up nicely in the second quarter. We have recently launched new products to the marketplace, including the pump-on-tube solution John referenced in his comments. And we're participating in the global launch for one of the largest brands in the skin care category. We designed the dispenser, in concert with the brand owner, and the product has launched in Asia and Europe and volume will increase significantly, with the North America launch next year. We also began re-purposing our folding carton facility in Brazil to make plastic dispensers, which will position us for strong growth in that important beauty and personal care market.", "These are examples of our commercial excellence and innovation capabilities combining to drive revenue growth in key global markets.", "Our earnings in the Home, Health & Beauty segment primarily reflect lower volumes in home and garden, which significantly impacted productivity and mix. Also, the folding carton business in Europe and Brazil, which we are in the process of exiting, had a modest loss in the quarter. In addition to the transition of the Brazil facility, we are working through an ongoing process with respect to our European folding carton business.", "In the third quarter, we expect segment profits to be lower than last year. We will benefit from continued gains in targeted markets, including volume increases and improved pricing for some of our packaging solutions. This will be offset, in part, by losses in our folding carton business, including transition costs in Brazil.", "Looking longer term, we're enthusiastic about the profit potential in this business under new leadership. We're continuing to shift the business model in this segment toward the highest-growth markets and highest-value products, including exiting folding cartons and focusing on dispensers and closures. This will help deliver consistent earnings improvement, as the margins in this part of our business have been in line with the industry and we have significant opportunities for additional growth already underway.", "In our Industrial segment, we are regaining historical profitability levels in Brazil by pricing for value across the business at the same time that we continue to up the ramp for the new paperboard machine in Tres Barras. Benefits from the expansion project flowed into our results, as expected, in the second quarter as we sold more paperboard in the open market and purchased less for use in our box plants across the country.", "The market for corrugated packaging was up roughly 4% overall in Brazil even as both industrial production and consumer confidence were weaker than expected. Our modest volume decreases were primarily related to the pricing actions we've taken rather than any weakness in our end markets. In India, where the inevitable move toward higher-quality corrugated packaging continued in the second quarter, our Ruby Macons business continued to see higher sales with targeted customers. We're anticipating the new paperboard machine in India will begin producing in the third quarter and then scale up to full commercialization next year.", "In the third quarter, we expect to see significantly higher segment profits from increased productivity as well as lower machine startup expenses in Brazil compared to last year. Volume should also increase as we capture the benefits of additional capacity through a combination of paper sales and corrugated box manufacturing. We also expect higher pricing to offset inflation as the business moves towards targeted margin rates.", "In Specialty Chemicals, our performance returned to strong levels after a challenging first quarter. We continued to generate profitable growth in high-value pine chemicals markets such as oil field solutions, asphalt additives and adhesives, as well as our leading position in carbon solutions. The addition of Resitec's pine chemicals business, previously a joint venture which we acquired last year, was also positive in the second quarter. Our technical sales and marketing efforts are accelerating, and our expectation is to see growing contribution from this business in Brazil. Profitability in the quarter was mainly impacted by additional maintenance compared to the year-ago quarter and continued growth investments in the business but at a more modest level.", "Our third quarter outlook for this segment is to generate modestly higher segment profits versus the record third quarter last year. Overall, our markets remain stable. With a lighter maintenance schedule and seasonally strong period for our business, we expect to run full for the quarter. This operating leverage will drive the expected increase.", "In Community Development and Land Management, we continued to see strong results from our value creation strategy with our well-located lands, including rural land sales and development activities. We are continuing to generate strong values with our rural land sales program averaging about $2,200 per acre, which is comparable to last year. And we're not seeing any slowdown associated with higher mortgage rates because our small tract buyers tend to be cash purchasers.", "In the development business, we are benefiting from our diverse leadership position in the fast-growing Charleston real estate market. The investment climate, including a specialty Boeings activity in the region and the port expansion, is translating into higher home sales, the most recent numbers showing sales up 20% and prices up 10% in the residential markets. We believe we have a 12- to 18-month head start on competitors in the region and are well positioned to capture opportunities that are emerging with our Nexton and East Edisto properties as well as industrial sites across the region.", "In the third quarter, we are expecting continued rural land sales progress to result in segment earnings similar to last year.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Mark. Mark?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Thanks, Jim.", "We're putting the challenging first half of the year behind us and are pleased to see commercial momentum from the second quarter extending into the second half of this year. We're looking forward to and expect significantly improved financial performance, beginning this quarter.", "While a combination of factors outside of our control have impacted our business, including sluggish global macroeconomic conditions and poor weather, operational challenges have been the main factor affecting our first half performance. Those operational issues were resolved in the second quarter, and our continued improvement represents substantial upside for the remainder of the year. We're aggressively executing on our commercial strategies and overhead cost program to help offset the challenges we saw in the first half of the year to enable us to deliver the earnings and cash flow improvement we've been anticipating for the back half of the year.", "First, we're driving toward higher profitability by accelerating our cost-reduction plans. We now expect overhead savings to exceed the high end of our target range for the full year. Second, with outage-related issues behind us, we're redoubling our manufacturing productivity efforts. The mills are now consistently delivering improved operating performance and we expect to realize significant operating leverage and productivity benefits. Third, we're focused on achieving the earnings and the cash flow benefits from the major strategic initiatives we've already made. Each of these major initiatives is on-track. And finally, we're delivering improved cash performance.", "In the second quarter, cash flow from operations was about $200 million, an improvement of over $100 million versus the second quarter of last year. Our efforts and progress in these areas, along with contributions from our profitable growth strategies, give us good confidence in our ability to deliver renewed earnings growth beginning this quarter and modest earnings growth for the full year, as well as setting the stage for a step change improvement in earnings and cash flow and -- performance for 2014.", "I'll quickly run down the financial elements of the second quarter then highlight the progress we're making on our performance-improvement initiatives. I'll then provide the key factors driving our improved earnings outlook for the third quarter.", "Sales in the quarter increased 1% before currency translation. Modest overall price and mix improvement and revenues from recently acquired businesses contributed 3% but were partially offset by lower volumes and lower forestland sales.", "Looking at volume, we saw solid growth and share gains in food packaging across bleached and Coated Natural Kraft paperboard solutions resulting in higher overall paperboard volumes of 4%. We also had solid volume gains in targeted personal care and healthcare packaging and in Specialty Chemicals end markets. The volume decline in the quarter primarily reflects the significant decrease we saw in home and garden markets and weakness in our European beverage and tobacco businesses. As the leader in home and garden dispensing solutions, we clearly felt the brunt of the weather-related impacts, with volumes down over 20% in the quarter.", "Overall price and mix improvement in the quarter was primarily driven by the Industrial business. We realized gains from pricing initiatives we took in the first half to offset the inflation that we've experienced in Brazil over the last 2 years. Lower price and mix in our Food & Beverage segment was largely impacted by unfavorable mix, including lower volumes with a large food service customer with whom we experienced a product specification change earlier in the year.", "In terms of the price increases we've implemented across bleached and CNK paperboard, we're seeing traction and expect steady improvement throughout the rest of this year.", "Adjusted EBIT of $133 million in the second quarter versus $154 million a year ago on the same basis was primarily impacted by the challenging outage and issues with our SAP implementation at the Covington mill. The total impact from these items was $35 million, representing a 240-basis-point reduction to the company's second quarter adjusted gross margin of 19.7%. Overall, input cost inflation remained relatively benign through the quarter.", "Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was $153 million or 10.7% of sales, which is a 190-basis-point improvement versus last year. The $26 million year-over-year improvement was driven by good progress with our overhead cost-reduction program as well as lower variable incentive compensation expense. Based on our progress with overhead cost reductions to date, we now anticipate savings in 2013 to exceed the high end of our previously communicated range of $25 million to $30 million. We expect the savings progression to build through the fourth quarter. And while our total program goal of reaching $75 million in savings in 2014 remains unchanged at this point, we're working to exceed that target as well as we continue to identify opportunities to reduce costs across the company.", "Our cash performance in the quarter was very strong. Cash flow from operations of almost $200 million was significantly improved versus the prior year second quarter. Lower overall working capital levels as well as higher cash flow associated with our expanded operations in Brazil drove the $100 million-plus improvement, resulting in about $40 million of free cash flow after all CapEx and dividends.", "CapEx in the first half of 2013 was $230 million, which as expected was down substantially from the $323 million we spent in the year-ago period, reflecting lower overall investments related to our expansion in Brazil. Our current outlook for full year 2013 CapEx remains approximately $500 million.", "Turning to the outlook. As we stated in our press release, we expect third quarter earnings to be above year-ago levels. We largely see the risks to achieving our outlook as balanced. We're offsetting lower growth expectations for Europe and key emerging markets and continued sluggish U.S. growth by executing on our profitable growth strategies to drive volume improvements in targeted packaging and Specialty Chemicals markets. We're also executing well on the controllables and expect benefits from our overhead cost-reduction program and improved productivity to contribute to our earnings growth. Lastly, we also expect increasing levels of operating leverage in our Industrial business as our Brazil expansion achieves higher levels of production.", "For the full year, we continue to expect modest earnings growth driven by the execution of our profitable growth strategies, overhead cost reductions and continued gains from our large strategic investments, including a step change in the earnings and cash flow performance in our Brazil business as well as savings from the new Covington biomass boiler. We now expect the boiler to come online ahead of schedule late in the third quarter. As this new biomass boiler replaces 2 older less-efficient units, we will realize benefits from significantly reduced energy costs, as well as lower operating and maintenance costs, including a benefit of $7 million to $10 million this year and expected annual run rate savings of $30 million to $40 million beginning in 2014.", "John?", "John A. Luke", "Mark, thanks very much.", "In summary, the momentum we expect to lead to earnings and cash flow improvement in the second half of the year is already underway. Our growth strategies are delivering top line benefits, and we're creating additional leverage from overhead cost reductions, better operating performance and the ramp-up in Brazil. In each of these areas, there was measurable progress in the second quarter and there's more to come in the second half, which gives us confidence that we're on the right track to achieve our profitable growth goals.", "This concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now turn to you for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Was hoping to get a little color possible on how -- the price increases in Industrial -- I'm sorry, in the Food & Beverage business, how they would typically roll through because, obviously, there was one increase you implemented earlier this year and there's another that's been announced. How -- when might we start seeing the benefits of that? And how much of it might be in place during 2014 in particular?", "John A. Luke", "Mark, thanks. I'll ask Jim to comment on that. I'll just say at the outset, as always, that we have a mix of contract and non-contract business, which influences the direction of the question you're raising. Jim?", "James A. Buzzard", "Thanks, Mark. Thanks, John. I think, John said, clearly, we have businesses under contract. And I think, as we've talked previously, a little over half of our business is under contract. Some of that is tied to beginning of the year where we negotiate those increases on January 1. Other increases are tied throughout the year, some of them also indexed to market indices. And so one of the things we saw as prices declined in the back half of 2012, we also saw some of those contracts resetting in the first part of this year. As those come back up again, those will reset at the higher prices. So that's the key part in terms of the contract side of things. There's also a lot that goes on, as you know, around both the -- both customer and product mix that impacts those numbers as well. Having said all that, I think we feel very good about the pricing actions we took in the first half of this year. We've moved our non-contract business up. And clearly, as our contract business comes up, we will focus on doing that as well. We're in the throes of increasing prices again, as we speak. Market dynamics feel positive in that regard. And clearly, the value that we provide in the marketplace, we think, supports the increases as well. So we feel good about that. We should see, as I think Mark referenced, those increases impact our results in the back half of the year and then trend up nicely in 2014 as well.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "And perhaps if -- on bleached board, are the price increases effective for export business as well? Or is that a separate category?", "James A. Buzzard", "Again, Mark, some of those, some of our export customers are under contracts, others are not. It's really the same dynamic as we have on our domestic customers as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "First question, on Industrial. Obviously, a good price performance there. The productivity was neutral in the quarter. I'm not sure kind of what your time line is in terms of when you're expecting that productivity to really start hitting. I think it was really more intended in the back half of the year, anyway. But I guess what I was hoping for is you'll give some nice color around the boiler sales and when you expect those to flow through in '13 and '14. So I was hoping maybe you could do something similar for the Rigesa project.", "John A. Luke", "Jim, do you want to take that up?", "James A. Buzzard", "Sure, Phil, I'll take that. I'll preface that by saying I've learned not to make bold predictions about major startups. But I think, having said that, we're very positive about the performance of the team in Brazil, the equipment that we have installed, the products that we're producing and the future of that operation. So as you know, these things go under extended startup curves, and we're on that curve. We're trending nicely where we anticipated we would be. I think the other thing that we referenced the last quarter that we probably haven't been as, maybe, open about or transparent about is this was more than just a new paper machine. We basically rebuilt that entire paper mill. So in addition to a new machine, we've got a brand-new lime kiln. We've got new pulping capabilities and a new wastewater treatment system. So there's a lot of complexity that goes into that operation today that candidly didn't exist previously. Having said that, as I referenced earlier in my comments, moving nicely up the curve. As you noted, we've expected those benefits to accrue in the second half of the year. We're on target to do that. And so we're very optimistic about the investment down there, what it can provide for the Industrial business for MeadWestvaco going forward.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "If I were to ask more explicitly, I think, in the past calls, we have kind of referenced maybe a $75 million savings number over time. Is it reasonable to think, similar to the boiler project, we might -- on a relative scale, we might be able to get a 1/3 of those saves starting to flow into the second half of this year? Or is it more of a 2014 story given the complexity that you mentioned?", "James A. Buzzard", "Yes, I mean, I think it's fair to say that we would -- should see a 1/3 of those -- of that number, as you referenced, beginning to flow into the back half of this year. Just a reminder: those savings are both productivity but it's also some growth that goes into those numbers, reintegration of the business as well. So all the areas we have identified previously as benefits to the project, we see coming forward. And as I said, we should see the beginning of that in the back half of this year but ramping up nicely in 2014.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. My second question was just on Home, Health & Beauty. You talk about these transition costs in Brazil, et cetera. I think, kind of the collective operating loss for Europe and Brazil folding carton last year was around maybe $10 million. So I guess what I'm wondering is at what point that negative $10 million kind of becomes a 0 moving forward. Just wanted to hear about the progress you're making on the European folding carton and how long to expect the Brazil transition costs.", "James A. Buzzard", "So I'll reference to maybe the Brazil transition costs and maybe look to Mark to talk about the Europe folding carton. In Brazil, as I noted in my comments, we're moving out of the folding carton business and expanding into primary plastics. That's really going to probably take us at least 9 months to go through that process. We want to make sure, as we exit out of the folding carton business, we support our customers appropriately in making sure that they can transition to other suppliers going forward. And at the same time, as we move that facility to make plastics products, building out that infrastructure, as well as moving the equipment in, we do it in a way that we're supporting current customers as well. So we have a very detailed project plan laid out to do that. We will begin that implementation towards the end of Q3 and should see that ramp more fully through the 6 months after that. So by end of Q1, Q2 next year, we should be fully operational as a primary plastics business in Brazil.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "And on the European side, we're in process with the marketing efforts. So that is underway, and we have high expectations for that as well.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Mark, one last question for you, just on the CapEx front. The $500 million for this year, I believe that includes $100 million for the Covington boiler. So wondering if you have any preliminary thoughts around CapEx for next year. I think, in the past, you've talked to kind of $350 million as more of a normalized level. I'm curious if we're going to hit normalized next year, if there's any other things in the works that we need to be aware of?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, I -- Phil, I think $350 million to $400 million is a good range. I mean, we still have some investment that we're going to be seeing in India relative to expanding some capacity there, as well as some capital for our Resitec business that we acquired remaining interest in at the end of last year. But I -- so I think that's a good range to think about.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "The market share you ceded in Brazil given your price increases, just curious, was that in line with your expectations as you kind of went through that process? Is it reasonable to expect that you'll regain that share over the next few quarters? And also if I could, what is your market expectation for demand for the back half of this year in Brazil?", "James A. Buzzard", "I'll pick that one up. In terms of our expectation of the price increase, I think, clearly we were out in leading that price increase in Brazil. And so as such, we can anticipate we'd see some impact. It's interesting to note that some of the business that did transition away from us is already coming back and, I think, a clear recognition of the value that we bring to the marketplace. So overall, I think that the loss of business will be about where we've anticipated it to be but, as we showed in the waterfall, good progress on moving prices. Including the back half of this year, I think the markets in the first half have grown around 4% in the country. Lots going on in Brazil today, so I'm not sure I can make a great prediction, but I would continue to see expected growth there. I think the really important story is the long term in Brazil. We remain very bullish about our business down there. And Brazil is an economy for the long haul, so we think we're very well positioned to take advantage of that long-term growth with the investments that we're making both in the Industrial side of the business, also importantly, as Mark noted, in Resitec and in our beauty and personal care business as well.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then just a second question, maybe for John. Last quarter when you had your press release and your conference call, you outlined a couple of very specific initiatives, one on the cost side, one on land. On the cost side, clearly, you're executing and it sounds like you are tracking above the upper end of your guidance before. Can you just give us a comparable update on what's happening with the land business too?", "John A. Luke", "Sure, I'd be happy to. I think it's suffice to say that we're very pleased with the interest that we're seeing in the land business. We are moving along aggressively there exploring different alternatives. And we continue, as we commented in April, to be very focused on doing everything we can to complete a transaction before the end of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.", "Steven Aragon - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "This is Steve Aragon filling-in for Mark Connelly. My first question is on the -- you guys expect a continued price improvement in industrial packaging. So are these price improvements going to be, like, a keeping up with cost inflation on labor and input costs? Or is it going to be, like, on top of this?", "James A. Buzzard", "Steven, this is Jim. I think, as we've talked previously, pricing obviously moves up in not necessarily in concert with inflation, it comes up more in chunks as you move pricing. So having said that, I think, as we've noted previously, we've gotten behind a little bit on inflation in the last couple of years. This price increase will move us above what current inflation is but helps restore that margin level. And then going forward, we will have to be vigilant about watching inflation and watching pricing and productivity to make sure that we're not only protecting our margins but we're continuing to grow them as well. And so that's something the team is very, very focused on.", "Steven Aragon - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "Okay. And my last question is on for the Home, Health & Beauty re-purposing of Brazilian folding carton business, is -- what kind of addition to the margins are you going to see at -- in, like, 9 months from now after everything is complete with the re-purposing?", "James A. Buzzard", "I -- Steve, I think it's a little hard for us to make a margin prediction 9 months from now. We're just beginning to start up that business. It think, suffice it to say that Brazil today is the second largest beauty and personal care market in the world, exhibiting very strong growth rates. The products we sell in today are well received by both our customers and the end consumer, and we've seen very dramatic growth. So this really positions us to shift our products into the higher-growth, higher-margin primary plastics business, which has strong margin potential going forward. I think we'll have a better feel for that as we get into the middle part of next year. But we see nothing that says that the margins in that business won't be similar to -- at the very least, to the margins we produce in primary plastics around the rest of the globe today.", "John A. Luke", "Yes. And Steve, it's John. I think Jim has answered that very well. I would just punctuate that by saying that, as we've comment, the underlying performance of that business today is masked by the turmoil in the folding carton markets, some of the home and garden seasonality issues and the aforementioned transition in Brazil. But we're making excellent progress in that business, most particularly in the healthcare and beauty and personal care side. And as we look to the coming year and getting that Brazilian business up to -- ramping up in operations and fully capitalizing on the market opportunities, we would expect you to begin to see a dramatically improved margin profile for that overall segment, one that we'll be very pleased with.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I guess, looking at the board business in your backlogs up 6, 7 weeks, how sustainable do you think those are? How much of it might have had to do with the issues at Covington? And just what do you think is driving the overall pickup in industry backlogs? Can you be a little bit more specific versus what you've mentioned prior to this in the call?", "James A. Buzzard", "Sure, Gail. In terms of the impact on Covington on overall backlogs, I think it's pretty modest. I think, if you look at the industry backlogs, they're as strong as we've seen them in a long time, frankly. So we would normally see some seasonality in the fourth quarter and I expect we will see some of that again this year. But in terms of our specific situations, we've talked previously we really have targeted our products into the higher-value markets. So in a place like China, for example, we continue to see good growth because we're focused on markets that require the performance, through our customers filling the lines, that we can deliver. It's focused on the cleanliness around food protection and those sorts of applications. So we continue to expect growth in those sorts of markets. I think, additionally, clearly, some of the tightness is caused by some of the reduction in supply that's occurred in North America in 2013. So on balance, we feel positive about the future strengths of the bleach board marketplace.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, but there's no segment, such as food, coming back from a weak 2012, or anything that is worth highlighting?", "John A. Luke", "No. I think this reflects overall market conditions.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And are you seeing any modest recovery in the home and garden area in the third quarter? Or is that just completely lost business?", "James A. Buzzard", "Gail, it's really a completely lost business. Those markets -- the strength is really around the spring season. And once that gone -- it -- is gone, it won't replicate itself until next year. So we're really not -- we're seeing some modest improvement on the hard surface cleaning business and some of the trigger business, but the fundamental lawn, garden and all those markets from the spring, those will not be replicated.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And just one last question. At the very beginning of the year, you announced a increased buyback authorization. Share count's drifting up, but I just -- I'm assuming you haven't been doing much with it. So can you just give us an update there and how you view that program and the targets that you talked about at the beginning of the year?", "John A. Luke", "Mark?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, Gail. We had increased the buyback to -- authorization to give us some flexibility. And certainly, we will intend to use that to maintain a share count that is more in line with our target. So as that creeps up as -- through option exercises and such, we'll bring that back in-line.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I guess, first question I had is on the Food & Beverage business. And it's nice to see some sequential pickup. You mentioned you'll be flat versus the year-ago quarter, but the year-ago quarter was also down versus 2011. You have some volume momentum, it would appear. You have a little bit of pricing. You have the Covington savings. So I was curious if you could parse out what factors will make for only-flat quarter year-on-year in food. I'm guessing the biggest thing will be the lagged price effect in bleached, but is there any other things, either with SAP or food service, you can call out? And I had a couple of follow-ons.", "John A. Luke", "Jim, do you want to take that up?", "James A. Buzzard", "Sure, George. I think you've identified some of the key drivers. We will see some of the lagged effect from the pricing that I referenced in my earlier comments. And again, we feel very positive about where that's going, and we'll begin to see more momentum as we come out of the third quarter. I think, in some of the other areas, inflation remains fairly benign, so we won't see much of a negative impact there. So I think, all in all, it should be a very solid quarter for us.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Is there a way to parse the food service impact, Jim?", "James A. Buzzard", "I mean, clearly, that is an impact for us. As I think Mark or I referenced in our comments, we're going through this transition with a new set of specifications with an important customer. That's going very well, and we're seeing momentum gains. So there will be some impact. I think, all these transitions, it's a little hard to predict the pace at which they will move. I will say that every month is better and we're moving nicely along the path. And we would certainly feel, by the end of the quarter, we should be in very good shape there.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "It's certainly a drag, still, year-over-year in the quarter itself.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Understood. 2 other questions. In Home, Health & Beauty, Jim, I think you enumerated a lot of things that are going on in the business. And obviously, it's -- your business isn't exactly an apples-to-apples comparison versus peers in specialty packaging and dispensing. And you have a lot of non-one-off factors that are hitting you this year. If you look at comparable segments in personal care or fragrance and cosmetic or in pharmaceutical dispensing, are your margins comparable with your peers from your own benchmarking? And if not, how -- could you help us size what the gap might be and how you'll close that over a couple of years?", "James A. Buzzard", "Sure, George. I think, to your point, we have a mixed business, at least at this point in time, which we, as I noted, are moving to address. But if we look at the primary plastics, dispensing caps and closures business, we parse that by end market, as we do. We feel very good about our relative performance given our competition. And we may be up slightly in one, down slightly in another, somewhat based on product mix or various things, but all in, we feel very positive where we are in that business. I think our efforts are driven on how do we improve that. And so our investments in emerging markets, we've talked about Brazil; the ongoing investments were making in innovation; clearly the medical plastics, progress we are making, where the margins are very attractive for us, all of those are things where we see, in spite of feeling good about where we are to date, making continued investments in improvement going forward. And we have very high confidence that, that business will continue to improve going forward.", "John A. Luke", "I think that -- and I think, George, I would just add that we have a number of what we hope and expect will be significant opportunities we're exploring through our innovation activities to that business as well. I think one of the things we would like to do as we move towards the coming year is provide an opportunity, either on a future call or an different, separate meeting, for Pete Durette to speak with you about the progress that is being made with the underlying business and his overall observations on the business, which are really quite positive.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes. And just to emphasize a couple of points. But I think, relative to the margin structure in beauty and personal care, in medical plastics, they're very much in line with competition. And importantly, we are seeing good growth, as John mentioned, related to innovation, new products as well as excellent efforts around our commercial excellence programs. So we do, as John said, expect to see good margin expansion in that segment in 2014.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes. Just back to home, healthcare and beauty briefly. Can you give us some sense of kind of your target margins and timeline for reaching those?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, Mark, we -- this is a -- again, this is a business that -- where we expect EBITDA margins to be in the high teens. And we expect to make good progress on that next year, as we said. There is a lot of DA in this business, there's a lot of depreciation and amortization. So as you look at the absolute EBIT, it is a little bit misleading. But this is -- the other thing that, at least at this point, tends to tamp down the margins is the fact that we got a relatively sizable but still nascent inherents [ph] business. And that's a business that we think has great potential. We are growing it. And right now, we're kind of at that tipping point, right? So it's roughly an $80 million business that has solid gross margins, but we've made a lot of investment in SG&A, whether it's product innovation, and in sales and marketing. But as that business grows and expands, there's tremendous leverage that will be a great compliment to the product innovation and growth that we expect to see in beauty and personal care. Jim talked about Brazil. John talked about new product innovation. So we have great confidence in our ability to profitably grow that business in next year but certainly in the years to come.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just over, briefly, in industrial packaging. I wondered if you could give us some sense of what the margin targets there might be or EBIT or EBITDA. I'm -- just I'm curious. Klabin has been up in the low- to mid-30s recently, and I'm wondering whether that's a reasonable number for you guys. It seems like it ought to be, as you don't use any recycled fiber, which is a big issue in Brazil. And then also in that business, is it possible we get a sense of what Ruby Macons is doing to margins and sales in that segment so that we could see just what Brazil is doing versus what you're doing in India?", "John A. Luke", "Mark, do you want to take that up?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes. Mark, I think your intuition is absolutely right. We expect the -- our business in Brazil to have margins that are very much in line with what Klabin reports over time. We're going to be ramping those up in the back half of this year, and we expect further improvement in 2014. And as it relates to Ruby Macons, we'll give you a little bit better breakdown of that business going forward, but it is -- given the early stage in terms of ramping up some of that capacity, it has been a little bit of a drag overall on that segment.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Is that an EBIT drag, Mark?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "I'm sorry?", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Is it an EBIT drag? EBIT negative?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "It's -- no, it -- no, it's not, no. It's making money, but it's not at the same -- it's got a lower margin structure than we have in Rigesa.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And what's approximate sales in India right now, just on an annual run rate?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "It's roughly $80 million, $85 million.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "First item, just to kind of get, and I'm not going to tie you down to an exact number, but if we look at the Food & Beverage segment, we had a $48 million drop in profit year-over-year, and $35 million of that you've called out to be Covington. And so if we, said let's take that and add that back in, that would get you to 87, because that's going to go away. And when you talk about $30 million to $40 million of improvement from Covington as you get the biomass boiler going, should we think of that, on top of that, kind of 87 number recognized in the course that [ph] each quarter has a lot of seasonality and there's pricing, et cetera, going on?", "[Technical Difficulty]", "James A. Buzzard", "Chip, you're breaking up a little. But I think one thing to remember is the $30 million to $40 million that Mark talked about was an annual number. And so roughly, $8 million to $10 million per quarter. But yes, I think, as we have turned the corner at Covington and begun to operate at the levels we'd expect ourselves to be doing, that -- those -- that will return to us and then the biomass boiler returns will be added to that sort of a number.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "And then also on -- when we look at Rigesa or, more specifically, industrial packaging, you mentioned obviously a nice improvement in the year-over-year number. How do you think you'll look versus the second quarter given what you're seeing down, especially with the ramp-up of Brazil?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, Chip, this is Mark. We will see a sequential improvement in operating profit in Brazil for the third quarter compared to the second quarter.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Got you. Okay, that's very helpful. And then the last one, Mark, is a really picky one. On the slides, it mentions in SG&A and in cost of sales, I think, a total of, like, $9 million in restructuring charges, but then on the [indiscernible] EBIT, the total was $5 million, so it didn't quite add up. And I was wondering if you -- whether it would be different in the restructuring charges and gross margin and SG&A being different than what it is in EBIT?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "You kind of broke up there, Chip, but if I understand your question, you're pointing out at what you believe is a difference between total restructuring charges versus what gets accounted for in COGS and SG&A?", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Yes. If you can -- Slide 4, in footnote 1, it says $6 million was in adjusted gross margin and then [indiscernible], so that's a total of $9 million. But if you look at the footnote 3, for just the EBIT, it says 5. And I would think it would add up to 9, as opposed to be $5 million.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Well they should add. You're right there. So we'll get back to you on that one, okay? But I certainly agree with you: In concept, they should foot.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "And then one last one on the pension situation as we look to next year. I mean, obviously, you guys have a fabulous pension situation, but as you look at the higher interest rates on the 10-year, and let's say they persist, do you see any meaningful change in that pension benefit, whether it would even directionally go up or down?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "I think we've done a pretty good job, Chip, over the last several years of using a liability management strategy. So we've got -- our liabilities are pretty well funded with a lot of fixed income instruments that are intended to mirror the future payout. So we would expect to have muted impact from interest rate changes going forward.", "Operator", "And our last question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "A couple of questions. Are you seeing any impact in the export market in bleached board, specifically, from the ramp-up of the Chinese capacity?", "James A. Buzzard", "That was -- this is Jim. We're not seeing it at this point in time. And I think, as I referenced in my comments, we're actually seeing reasonably good growth in China. And again it's really the markets that we tend to play in with our products and the value we provide. So as we speak, no, we have not seen an impact from their ramp-up.", "Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then you talked about taking some share from corrugated in the club stores. Can you talk about if that's more in the bleached board -- with the bleached board product, or the CNK product? And maybe can you just give us a sense of how many incremental tons you guys think are -- you're selling as a result of the market share wins this year?", "James A. Buzzard", "So Alex, it would primarily be in the CNK. And really, the value that we're providing there is a -- as you know, it's great in terms of the strength of that product and -- but also, it gives a great printing surface in the aesthetics. And so we're seeing moves in some of the glass beverage markets. We're seeing moves in frozen food, and we're seeing moves in the dry food categories as well. So really, winning in a number of places, with good opportunity ahead of us. I frankly don't have a number for you that would say the number of tons tied to all of the initiatives that we have going on. But we can look at that for you.", "Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful, Jim. And just one last quick one from me, for Mark. It seems like the corporate expense number is moving around a little bit here. And I may have missed this, but do you have an full year outlook for what the corporate expense line should be for '13?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "No, we haven't given that, Alex, but the -- we're making good progress in terms of taking our costs down, and we did have some benefit from lower-incentive accruals this past quarter. So as we look out to Q3, we'd expect to be at a level that was slightly below where we were in the second quarter last year, which also had the benefit of a reversal of comp expense. So all in, I think we're trending at lower levels in terms of our true corporate department spend. And we'd expect to see that continue and, frankly, improve slightly as we move throughout the course of the year.", "Operator", "There are no questions in the queue at this time. Speakers, please continue.", "Jason Thompson", "Thanks, Toni. And thanks, everyone, for joining us. We look forward to catching up with you next quarter. Toni, can you please give out the replay information?", "Operator", "Certainly. This conference will be available for a replay after 12 p.m. Eastern today through August 30, 2013, at midnight.

Welcome to the MeadWestvaco First Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Director of Investor Relations, our host, Mr. Jason Thompson. Please go ahead.", "Jason Thompson", "Thanks, Tara, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced our results before the market opened. The notification of this morning's call was broadly disclosed. Further, this morning's call is being webcast at mwv.com, and slides that accompany this call are available there as well. I'll briefly remind you that certain statements we make are forward looking, and are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties described in our public filings. Furthermore, contents contain time sensitive information that, although correct today, may change with the passage of time.", "All the results we show this morning are presented on a continuing operations basis. For the first quarter, we reported income from continuing operations of $71 million or $0.41 per share. X items, adjusted income from continuing operations was $75 million or $0.43 per share. Now here to tell you more about our results for the first quarter are John Luke, Chairman and CEO; Jim Buzzard, our President; and Mark Rajkowski, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to John.", "John Luke", "Thanks, Jason, and good morning. I'm pleased to report that MWV is off to a very strong start through its first quarter following a record year in 2010. We continue to demonstrate the strength of our transforming business through revenue and earnings growth across the company. ", "MWV's results in the first quarter were very strong during what is a seasonally slower period for our business. We expanded revenue by 8% and generated $71 million of income, $0.41 per share from continuing operations, a record performance for the first quarter. This step change in our performance stems from the work we have undertaken over the past several years to reshape our market participation and our cost and operating structure, improvements to our business model that we have confidence are sustainable going forward. ", "During the quarter, we continued to make progress with our commercial strategy, building increased business in targeted markets especially within emerging economies, expanding our market share with brand owners and diligently driving price based on the value we deliver to our customers, which also positions us ahead of the curve on rising input costs.", "The impact of this commercial success was particularly apparent in the results of our Packaging businesses and Specialty Chemicals. That said, we also made good progress in our Land Management business and had a positive performance in Consumer & Office Products. ", "Let me share with you some specific examples of where our market participation strategies contributed to strong results during the quarter. We had nearly 9% volume growth in food packaging. This was the result of our focus on engaging global brand owners to specify our paperboard for use in products such as frozen food and aseptic dairy, a category that is growing rapidly in markets like China. ", "We won new packaging machinery placements with global beverage customers. These placements had a small positive impact on the quarter, but more important, they give us a footprint to further build our participation in targeted dairy, carbonated and beer markets, again especially in emerging economies. ", "We had double digit sales increases in the home and garden market. We gained additional business from one of our largest global brand owners because of the new capabilities from our Spray Plast acquisition for their product extensions into new regions, including the Middle East and South Africa.", "We saw healthy demand in fragrance during the quarter, most notably in Europe, and also expanded the customer base for our leading airless dispensing solutions. Our leading customers continue to reinforce that our airless technology is the right solution for the growing personal care market. ", "In health care, we continued an ongoing adherence packaging trial with Kroger. We also funded research demonstrating that our adherence packaging solutions improve patient adherence to prescriptions. The results of this research will be published broadly soon, and we expect to use data on patient health and retailer profitability to help expand our Shellpak programs with customers such as Walmart and Kroger. ", "In Brazil, Rigesa continued to do well in targeted corrugated packaging markets for poultry and produce, as well as folding cartons for personal care. There has been some moderation in economic activity in Brazil from the extremely rapid growth rates during much of the past year due to an increase in inflation and related government initiated interest rate hikes and currency appreciation. We are well positioned and experienced to deal with these changes.", "In Specialty Chemicals, we continue to have outstanding results in all of our end markets during the quarter. There was a small rebound in volume for automotive carbon with an increase in car and truck production. But in most cases, we're generating these results by gaining share with our innovative products, including Evotherm warm mix asphalt, which is gaining ground in a generally slow market for road paving. ", "These examples of our progress demonstrate that we are winning in the areas where we have made strategic participation choices to grow in our most profitable markets, doing so with innovative value creating solutions. This foundation enables us to further hone our commercial excellence initiatives, which are directed toward achieving participation and pricing that reflects the value we bring to customers, while also staying well ahead of mounting inflationary pressures. ", "Our progress during the quarter is also indicative of continued progress in our effort to establish a management structure that supports an end market approach to our business. As we complete the process, we will provide more visibility into the profitable growth opportunities that we see in our markets, and we'll do that by reporting in a new segment structure at that time.", "In the meantime, Jim will continue to share details on our performance by segment as we presently report them. And then Mark will follow with a review of our financial performance for the first quarter and an outlook for our business in the second quarter. ", "Before turning to Jim, however, I want to emphasize that we continue to drive the execution of our profitable growth plans even as we deal with ongoing challenges associated with the global economic environment, including events and developments that are beyond our control, such as the tragedy in Japan, disruptions in the Middle East or moderating economic activity in Brazil. Regardless of the challenges that emerge, we continue to focus on the elements of our strategy that we can best control and influence. ", "We know that as much as we might like it, our improvement won't always follow a straight line upwards due to the influence of such external developments. With this in mind, we actively scan the horizon for such developments and work to design mitigation plans in advance while remaining very confident about our company's momentum and future performance.", "That confidence hinges on the profitable growth opportunities we are capturing in markets that have demonstrated profitable    positive and profitable momentum even through difficult economic times. These opportunities will be the key to further earnings improvement in the future. I'll now turn to Jim for a report on our operational and segment performance. Jim?", "James Buzzard", "Thank you, John. MWV's performance in the first quarter shows that our transformed business model is generating sustainable earnings improvement across our businesses, improvements that we expect to continue throughout 2011. ", "Some highlights of our first quarter performance include an 8% sales growth. This was driven by value based pricing and mix improvements that directly track to our reshaped market participation and which have enabled us to stay ahead of inflation. ", "All of our businesses had price and mix gains with particular strength in our Packaging Resources and Specialty Chemicals segments. Strong productivity gains. This added to the operating leverage we've already created with our transformed business model and contributed to our record adjusted EBIT for the first quarter. On commercial momentum in the markets we've targeted for profitable growth. Our markets are generally strong, and we've added new business and new customers, as well as continuing to grow our sales in emerging markets. ", "I'll now provide some details about the contributions from each of our business segments to this performance. Additional information is available in our press release and the slides that accompany this call. ", "In the Packaging Resources segment, sales were up 9% in the first quarter with especially strong year over year pricing gains across all of our paperboard end markets. We continue to make strong gains in global markets for food packaging, liquid packaging and commercial print. In China, for instance, we had double digit volume growth for aseptic liquid packaging with key dairy customers. And we also had strong sales gains in Rigesa for corrugated packaging for poultry and produce. Overall volume in the food market was up nearly 9% in the first quarter, and we believe there is much more room to grow in this market around the world. ", "Looking at overall shipments by volume. Bleached board was essentially unchanged, and CNK was down slightly in the quarter. We exited some lower value product lines, and we had some weather related and transportation challenges during the quarter. In general, availability of truck and ocean freight across our operations has been constrained as economic activity has improved. Shipments in April have picked up and are above the levels we saw during the first quarter. And our backlogs are holding at 4 to 5 weeks. ", "Earnings in the Packaging Resources segment were $84 million in the quarter. This is a very strong result compared to the first quarter last year even considering the $25 million negative impact from reduced fiber availability during the last year's first quarter. Our market participation strategies and strong value proposition drove a 10% improvement in our pricing and product mix, which more than offset increased input costs and, along with productivity improvements, contributed to this very strong result to start the year. ", "I would add that the investment in Rigesa's business in Brazil is on track at this early stage of the project. We have completed the major purchase commitments, and the team is fully staffed and executing site prep work at our Tres Barras facility.", "In the Consumer Solutions segment, sales increased by 2% during the quarter, reflecting growth in packaging markets for home and garden, tobacco, fragrance and luxury personal care products. The business also had broad based gains in emerging markets, including new personal care customers in China, India and Latin America. Including the strong growth we're seeing in home and garden packaging due to the acquisition of Spray Plast, our total dispensing platform sales were up 10% in the quarter. ", "Earnings in the Consumer Solutions group were up 4%. Again, our pricing and product mix enhancements offset some inflation, especially for resin. We recouped these increased resin costs through contractual pass-throughs. But as we've noted before, there is a lag when resin prices are moving up. The business delivered productivity improvements in addition to these pricing and product mix gains that resulted in an increase in profitability for the quarter compared to last year. ", "In the Consumer & Office Products segment, we had sales and earnings growth in the quarter in which we build inventory for the upcoming back to school season in North America. Sales were up 4% driven by higher volumes of calendar and time management products and the shift of sales for back to school products in Brazil from the fourth quarter of 2010 into the first quarter of 2011. ", "Our School Supplies business in the U.S. was somewhat lower during the first quarter, but we continue to plan for stable back to school demand and expect growing contributions from new products, such as our early learning line for preschool students. The segment continued to generate good productivity, which helped drive a modest improvement in profits compared to last year. ", "In the Specialty Chemicals segment, we again had very strong sales and earnings gains from the disciplined application of our market participation strategies. The team continues to have success with our value added solutions for automotive, infrastructure and energy markets both in developed and emerging geographies. The segment recorded double digit volume growth in performance chemicals for oilfield, inks and adhesives markets, as well as an increase in carbon volume for cars and trucks in the U.S., Europe and the emerging markets. Good productivity gains also contributed to another record breaking quarter of profitability for this business. ", "In Community Development and Land Management, we had a breakthrough transaction during the quarter. We sold our first development property in the Charleston region as part of our joint venture with the Rockefeller Group. In just a little over year, this site was transformed from course land to a 1.1 million square foot tire distribution facility and then sold to an affiliate of USAA for nearly $50 million. We also closed on approximately 5,600 acres of rural land sales with gross proceeds of $21 million or an average price per acre of more than $3,700. ", "This good progress from our development activities and rural land sales during the first quarter demonstrates the impact of our focus on extracting the maximum value from our landholdings, especially in South Carolina. This remains a very attractive market for residential and industrial developments, including properties that can take advantage of the new Boeing Dreamliner assembly plant in North Charleston. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss some of our financial metrics for the first quarter. Mark?", "E. Rajkowski", "Thanks, Jim. We are very pleased with the great start to what we expect will be another year of improved financial performance at MWV. We had record first quarter adjusted EBIT and generated adjusted EBIT margins of over 11%. These results directly reflect the excellent progress we're making across our businesses to generate higher sustainable returns for our shareholders. We're delivering this through outstanding commercial execution, driving price based on the value we deliver to customers, further penetrating emerging markets across our businesses and increasing sales of innovative products as well as a continued focus on cost and productivity. ", "I'll quickly review some of the highlights of our first quarter results and then provide our outlook for the second quarter. We continue to generate top line success with strong commercial execution. We're growing in the higher value areas of our business, which is improving overall mix and generating stronger pricing. The contribution from price mix improvement across our businesses was 7 percentage points of our 8% top line growth. ", "In the quarter, sales in emerging markets were up 24% compared to last year, with strong contributions from products for liquid packaging, home and garden and beverage markets, corrugated packaging in Brazil, as well as continued gains across Asia and Brazil in specialty chemical solutions for automotive, infrastructure and energy markets.", "We're also benefiting from increased momentum with innovative products across our packaging platform. We had solid growth with new products in personal care packaging for fragrance customers and continued to win new business with our airless products. ", "And our home and garden business continues to grow with the products and technologies we acquired with Spray Plast. In fact, we are adding 3 additional lines to service new wins with existing customers in this market. We're also continuing to grow our pipeline including shopper ready packaging innovations for our major food and beverage customers and new adherence packaging solutions for our healthcare business. ", "We also continue to generate significant leverage with MWV's transformed operating platform, which helped drive nearly 500 basis points of year over year improvement to adjusted gross margin. And as Jim said, we're delivering substantial operating productivity from our streamlined asset base, and that's contributing strongly to our bottom line results.", "Looking at cash and capital deployment, adjusted cash flow from operations improved about $30 million over last year's first quarter. This includes a more aggressive buildup of finished goods inventories across each of our businesses, in line with our forecast of stronger demand during the busy summer season for asphalt and beverage sales as well as solid demand for back to school products. ", "During the quarter, we spent $113 million on capital, a large portion of which relates to the expansion of our Corrugated Packaging business in Brazil, which is progressing very well. As we've indicated, about 2/3 of the project investment will take place this year. ", "I'm also pleased to report that we've secured in country financing from the Brazilian Development Bank. This local financing is not only economically attractive but also provides us with a natural hedge against currency. ", "Now turning to our outlook. We expect to deliver another solid year of earnings improvement in 2011. Our commercial strategies are working. And we'll remain focused on driving revenue growth in targeted markets and protecting margins with value based pricing initiatives. We are, however, continuing to closely watch the trajectory of oil prices and the impact on our energy, raw materials and freight costs. ", "As we demonstrated this past quarter, we are well positioned to manage our businesses through the near term effects of elevated oil prices. However, if oil prices continue to rise over a prolonged period, along with ongoing food inflation and high domestic unemployment, it could reduce consumer spending and slow overall demand in the back half of this year. This would impact the relative degree of our year over year earnings improvement.", "Now a quick rundown of our second quarter outlook for each of our segments. In the Packaging Resources segment, we expect profits to be above last year and above this year's first quarter earnings as we head into the busier season for beverage. Order backlogs are above normal levels for this time of year at 4 to 5 weeks as we're seeing solid demand in food and beverage and stronger shipments in April. We'll also continue to benefit from pricing actions taken over the last 12 months. Partially offsetting these positive segment profit drivers will be higher costs for raw materials and freight. ", "Looking ahead for the full year, we are planning a 40 day outage to repair our recovery boiler at the Covington mill in the fourth quarter. This is longer than our usual annual maintenance outage and will result in approximately $30 million of higher costs compared to the previous year.", "In the Consumer Solutions segment, we expect profits to be modestly above year ago levels, driven by volume growth in targeted markets, price and mix improvements, including the recovery of higher costs through contractual price escalators and continued productivity gains. These benefits will be partially offset by higher costs for materials, particularly resin and freight. ", "In the Specialty Chemicals segment, we expect another strong year over year increase in profits. Benefits from continued strong demand across Pine Chemical and activated carbon markets, price and mix improvements and higher productivity levels are expected to drive substantially improved earnings. However, inflation in certain raw materials and freight costs will partially offset these positive factors in the near term. ", "In the Consumer & Office Products segment, we are expecting another solid overall back to school season. Segment profit is expected to be comparable to last year's very strong second quarter performance. ", "In our Community Development and Land Management business, real estate market conditions make it difficult to forecast sales and earnings. However, there has been an increase in inquiries for both rural and industrial properties, and we are continuing with our approach to marketing that we expect will generate premium values per acre. That said, based on our current pipeline, we are expecting lower land sales compared to both last year and the first quarter of this year. With that, I'll turn it back to John.", "John Luke", "Thanks, Mark. To summarize, our strong results in the first quarter reflect the benefits of our continuing business transformation as well as the diligent execution of commercial strategies in our targeted markets. We're winning with our highest value products, capturing profitable growth opportunities and staying ahead of inflation with pricing actions based on the value we bring to customers, all while delivering productivity throughout our manufacturing system around the world. This progress puts us in an excellent position to continue to generate improved earnings for our shareholders in the second quarter and beyond. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning, and we'd now be glad to address your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Connelly, CLSA.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "John, a couple of things. In Packaging Resources, despite the lack of volume growth, you obviously had some pretty strong results. How should we think about that for next quarter? You're expecting higher volumes. Should we expect you to be able to leverage that further and actually get margins up? Or should we be thinking more in terms of stable margins at this point?", "John Luke", "Mark, thanks very much. Our game plan would be to continue, through our participation strategies, to put emphasis on expanding margins wherever we possibly can. And you're right, we would expect obviously a rebound in volume as we do so. The challenge, as Mark Rajkowski indicated, is to balance those participation and pricing strategies against what is going to continue to be pressure from an inflationary cost standpoint. So balancing those 2 will be key. But you can be sure that we will be actively working to manage pricing driven by participation and a valued focus in the marketplace.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "John, do you feel like you're ahead of the curve in terms of pricing? Because certainly, we're seeing other paperboard companies struggling quite a bit more to hit expectations than you are. Do you think of yourself as ahead of the curve on pricing? Or are you just keeping up with these price hikes that are coming out? And is the improvement coming from someplace else?", "John Luke", "I think the improvement is coming through a variety of areas. But clearly, on the inflationary front, one of the key priorities we have established for ourselves is a business model that enables us, through good visibility into what's going on, to keep as far ahead of the curve as possible.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Okay. And just quickly on Specialty Chemicals. Your focus on autos is clearly paying off cyclically right now. But can you talk about the geographic balance of your sales as you talk about the    your optimism about sustaining these high levels of performance? Can you talk about whether the geography is going to continue to shift for you?", "John Luke", "I think I'll ask Jim to comment in a moment, but I think it's fair to say that the geography will continue to shift, and we are working hard to sustain and nurture participations that we've worked to build over a long period of time in the developed markets outside of the United States, like Europe, as well as in emerging markets where auto production and auto consumption is continuing to grow, most notably in China. Jim?", "James Buzzard", "Mark, and I would add to that. While we are seeing some modest improvement based on the automotive volume growth, really the performance is driven across the entire platform. So the performance chemical markets and their participation in oilfield, adhesives, our asphalt participation, every one of them is really contributing to the strong performance improvement.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Okay. Very helpful, thank you.", "John Luke", "Thank you, Mark.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "John, I had a few questions, one for Mark Rajkowski. Mark, you over the past few years have really been focusing on this SG&A number, and it actually, as a percent of sales, creeped up this quarter. Can you talk a little bit about that? And are we    have we still got a game plan to get this down to around 10%?", "E. Rajkowski", "Yes, couple of things, Mark, on that. We've made good progress over the last number of years. We continued to focus on opportunities to continue to drive out nonvalue added back office costs. We are focused on growing in a number of key areas, particularly in just    we talk about our health care business, beauty and personal care, food in emerging markets. So we do have some investments that are there a little bit ahead of the growth curve, okay? And we also saw last year as we    if you'll recall a year ago this time, we did have some credits as a result of the reversal of some incentive comp of about $7 million. So you have that tough compare. And we also saw a little bit of, which was welcome, a bump up in our stock price. So as you look at some of the noncash charges we've seen for deferred comp and long term comp, that's been a factor as well. But I think the point here is that we are very focused on continuing to improve our business model. But we want to make sure that we continue to appropriately invest for profitable growth in the future.", "John Luke", "Yes. And Mark, let me just build on Mark's comments. I think Mark has summed it up well. We are actively working to excise nonvalue related costs, and that is an ongoing effort. And you will continue to see us move in that direction. But as Mark noted, the participation shift both here and around the world, which is paying off nicely most particularly in emerging market growth year over year, quarter after quarter, is a reflection of very concerted, deliberate investments, on some cases ahead of the curve in such things as innovation, commercial excellence, capabilities and in talent acquisition. That's all part of the strategy to ensure that we not only succeed in going where we want to go, but that we're able to build on that with the momentum that we've demonstrated is desirable.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. Second question I had. The    actually, the input cost inflation, which I think you'd pointed to about $35 million year over year, that was actually a little bit smaller than I might have expected. Is there anything going on inside the company that might have hedged you or protected you a little bit that may roll off as we move through the year?", "E. Rajkowski", "Mark, let me answer that one. We hedge natural gas, but that was not really a driver of that performance. So we look at our energy, materials and freight inflation, it was still up about 5% year over year. That is a pretty healthy increase. We have built a very, very strong global sourcing group, and certainly, they have been working hard at moderating those impacts. But that was not too far off of what we expected. It continues to be a very challenging environment as oil continues to move upward, but we've got a good sourcing team, which is really what we're leveraging to keep those costs in check as much as possible. Hedging was not really a    really had no significant impact on that factor.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. One area that was a little weaker than I expected was Consumer Packaging. Some of that, I think, was probably inputs, some of the other things you align [ph]. But it just seemed to me in some of the markets that you pointed to, your volume was weaker than I would have expected, particularly comparing it to another company that reported last week that has a big presence in sort of pumps and dispensers and things. I wondered if you could just talk a little more about that.", "James Buzzard", "Mark, this is Jim. Maybe Mark and I will tag team on this one. I think in key targeted markets that we've talk about, airless fragrance or fine mist sprayers, all really solid growth in emerging markets. We continued to see good growth there. The real driver of volume for us downward was the, what we call our 2 cc pumps, which are largely tied to hand sanitizers and soaps and those sorts of things. And if you'll recall, with H1N1 last year, we were just completely sold out. Without the good flu season this year, unfortunately, those volumes have dropped off.", "E. Rajkowski", "Yes, I think we did see a little bit of a softness consistent with the market in carbonated soft drinks and beer. So I think, as Jim pointed out, the impact    the tough compare year over year on H1N1 on the 2 cc pump and a little bit of softness in beverage were really the key drivers there.", "John Luke", "Yes, and I would just add to that, Mark, that I think your broader question is what can we expect to see there. And we    our strategy related to market participation strategy, continue to identify significant opportunities for growth in the categories that we have targeted both here and around the world. And we are and we'll be continuing to put major emphasis on ensuring, with a real focus on profitable participation, that we are growing with or hopefully above market rates.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. The last question I had, just can you talk about the land outside of South Carolina in the U.S? Just remind us of sort of the acreage that remains outside of South Carolina and also what the strategy is there.", "E. Rajkowski", "Yes, right. I think, Mark, roughly 300,000 plus acres are outside of South Carolina. And most of that is rural land, and we're looking at opportunities to achieve enhanced premium values per acre through some of the segmentation work that we're doing. Part of that also is lands we have in West Virginia that certainly is important to supporting our Covington mill and also, as we've pointed out, holds some, we believe, some natural gas reserves as well. So that's really the bulk of what we have outside of South Carolina.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay, very good, I'll turn it over. Thanks, guys.", "E. Rajkowski", "Thank you, Mark.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rick Skidmore from Goldman Sachs.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Spray Plast acquisition. It sounds like it's done pretty well. Can you just maybe comment on its contribution? And then as you look across your businesses, are there    what does the pipeline of M&A opportunities look like in either geographies, product lines? And then also potential size that you might be looking at?", "John Luke", "Rick, it's John. Let me comment broadly, and then I'll ask Jim to speak specifically to your Spray Plast question. I think exactly what you're seeing in Spray Plast is the approach we're bringing to considering bolt on acquisitions where we can get good market position, acquire technology that broadens our capabilities, and where we see good opportunity to extend that technology into new and growing markets either through our own plant expansion or through our customer's distribution system. And I think as we look at the potential for similar acquisitions both in that end of our business and others, we're actively scouring the landscape. But our real focus is going to be ensuring that we're value driven, that we're looking for things that will meaningfully enhance our participation strategies and support the broader market, profitable market growth that I referred to a moment ago in Mark Wilde's question. So you'll be seeing more of these things as we go forward. Jim, on Spray Plast?", "James Buzzard", "Thank you, John. Rick, with Spray Plast, we have been very excited about the acquisition. The integration has gone very, very well. We've seen the improvements in price. We've seen improvements in mix. We've seen improvements in both top and bottom line performance. As John mentioned, part of it is the technology that we acquired that we can now take globally. So it gives us a lot of growth opportunities to build off of this acquisition with organic growth. And then lastly, it's a really strong team. And so we're really pleased to have them on board, and we see a lot of opportunity to leverage the acquisition with further organic growth around the world.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. Maybe just shifting to Specialty Chemicals for a moment. As you think about the sustainability of the performance and what's driven that performance over the last year, is it primarily that you've been able to increase volume and so you're getting the benefit of the operating leverage in the business? Or is it mostly price that's been driving that performance?", "James Buzzard", "Rick, really -- this is Jim, it's been a combination of both things, frankly. And this, I think as I reported on the last call, is really work that we've been going on for the last 3 or 4 years all coming together. And so whether it's our expansion and participation in places like Brazil and China. We've made a capacity expansion down in our DeRidder facility. We've moved into new markets and changed our market participation strategy in areas like adhesives, oilfield, chemicals and others. It really is a culmination of all those things, plus good focus on pricing for value. Our products have a really important part to play in our customers' products performance. And our ability to quantify that and get that value based pricing has been a key lever as well. And really, those are the reasons why performance has improved so much. They're also the reasons why we've got a lot of confidence that it is sustainable and frankly that there's further opportunity for improvement over time.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And Jim, just on the volume. Is that volume    is it under any longer term contracts with customers? Or is this a shorter term volume?", "James Buzzard", "Rick, we tend to be shorter term, so we don't have any really long term supply contracts. Part of that reason is our customers' demands are always changing. And so it allows us to drive our innovation, have really strong technology in our products. And their changing demands require us to keep up with them.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. And then just lastly in the Land Management business. Is there anything, as you look at the pipeline over the next couple of quarters or year, that would be similar to what you did with your joint venture partner where you built the warehouse and then sold it? Is there anything that you see that's upcoming over the next year that looks similar to that?", "E. Rajkowski", "Yes, Rick. This is Mark. There are a number of projects that the team is actively engaged on. And they're making great progress. But over the next 2 or 3 quarters, there's nothing that is in the pipeline that is as significant as we saw in this first quarter. And as you know, we are going to be having a day in June for our investors to provide them with a much more detailed look at the progress that, that team has made. And that'll give you and others a much better sense in terms of the timing of some of those cash flows.", "John Luke", "Maybe a comment to cash flows. In the sense of we have good visibility into the overall planning that lies ahead, so you'll understand better how projects like the one we described this morning fit into the grand scheme, and you'll have a sense of what's likely to come down the road.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub from the Buckingham Financial.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group", "Congratulations. It really was a very, very strong quarter.", "John Luke", "Thanks, Mark.", "E. Rajkowski", "Thanks, Mark.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group", "One question on the Covington outage at the end of the year. What exactly are you doing there? And when you come out of it into next year, are you going to have enhanced capabilities or is this just    is it really kind of a large maintenance project?", "James Buzzard", "Hey, Mark. This is Jim. It's really a combination. So we, as we noted, are having some very extensive boiler work that we have to get done, and that really is the reason for the duration. But part of the work that we will do with the machine down is make some enhancements on a couple of large world class machines that we have there. So we should have some enhanced capability coming out of the outage while going into 2012.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group", "Okay. And then I saw on the slide on the Community Development and Land Management you noted that approximately 190,000 acres in West Virginia land. You have mineral rights leases with Bluescape at this point. Can you provide any more details on what those    the terms on those mineral right leases?", "E. Rajkowski", "Hey, Mark. You got that right. And we're not at this point permitted, given the terms of the agreement, to provide details on the royalty arrangements.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group", "Okay. But I do think it says they are currently drilling test wells. When might we get a sense as to the results on those test wells?", "E. Rajkowski", "I think we'll learn more over the course of the next year or so. I mean, there is a phased in approach that they're going to be taking on our property. And as those wells get drilled, we'll learn more. But it's not going to happen next quarter. This is something that takes place over a number of quarters.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman, UBS.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Can you talk a little bit more about the demand trends that you're seeing? You talked about seeing a pickup in April. Is that more kind of catch up from the weakness in the first quarter, underlying demand strength [ph]? Are there any end markets just from kind of a cyclical underlying demand level that you're particularly encouraged by or concerned about?", "James Buzzard", "Yes, this is Jim. We certainly wouldn't characterize it as an underlying bubble. I think there's a couple things going on. I referenced a few anomalies in the first quarter I will confess. Seasonally, the second quarter is stronger for us. So we would expect to see some seasonality there. And the fact that our backlogs are steady at 4 to 5 weeks leads us to have confidence that the demand is there.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay.", "John Luke", "And Gail, I would just add on that. I think that Jim has characterized that well. I think it's one of the    we know we're in a period where we're seeing relatively sound demand, there's been some moderation in some areas. As we look more broadly, fortunately we haven't experienced that much at this stage of the game. But our focus is all on, as I've said several times this morning, on market participation, identifying areas that are going to be more stable, that are going to be likely to grow less subjected to what we hope won't occur but, as Mark in his formal comments indicated, could be, if oil prices continue to go up, some adverse influences on consumer spending. So our participation strategies are all designed to enable us, against this relatively stable backdrop and improving backdrop, to further ensure our volume while ideally giving us an opportunity for enhanced participation in certain areas.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay, thank you. And touching on the productivity gains you've been making. At this point, are we starting to have all of those hanging fruits picked? Or is this something that you think you can kind of maintain on an ongoing basis?", "John Luke", "Jim?", "James Buzzard", "Gail, this is Jim. Our objective, and then it's one that we've been delivering against and we expect to continue to deliver against, is to shoot for 3% to 3.5% productivity gains year in and year out. And while certainly, we have gotten some of the low hanging fruit, what we've really developed is a very rigorous program within each of the facilities with detailed diagnostics. We do a lot of Lean Six Sigma training with the entire organization, and we continue to refresh the agenda of things for the teams to be working on, on all of our operating platforms. And to date, we have seen the fact that we can continue to drive those gains, and we expect to do it for the foreseeable future.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And just last question. Looking at Consumer Solutions and, I guess, the gap between price and cost. Is there anything structurally that you can do there to change that relationship, change your contracts with quicker pass throughs? Is there anything that can help you finally start to catch up with that?", "James Buzzard", "Well, certainly, I think as I mentioned in my comments on the plastic side of the business, we have in North America the very high percentage of our business tied to resin prices. So we get those pass throughs automatically. The dilemma is that those typically lag 90 days, some 180 days. So we have been working over the last couple of years to put those in place. They didn't exist as rigorously as they do today, and we've been working to shorten them up. So it is an area that, given the inflationary environment that we are seeing now and expect to see in the future, we'll continue to focus on.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "And would you consider trying to look at pass throughs in other ways when you look at other businesses? The mill businesses, would there be a possible way to kind of just make sure you can stay ahead of inflation or...", "James Buzzard", "Well, I think in the mill based businesses and others, what we have really been focused on is this value based pricing that we talked about. And so it's understanding the value that we provide to our customers and making sure that all of our products are priced appropriately and, as John noted in his comments, making sure that as we look out to where inflation is, we're really focus on staying ahead of the curve. And so I think the contracts have both plusses and minuses. And I think our ability to expand our margins through our pricing and mix improvements this year and throughout last year suggests that if we were tied just to inflation, we may not have [indiscernible].", "E. Rajkowski", "And the other point I'd make is I think we'll continue to see good progress there as we deliver more new products and innovations to the marketplace. And with those successful commercializations, we will be in an even better position to get paid for value and continue to move up that mix curve and get price.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line Bill Gresh [ph] with JPMorgan.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "On the Specialty Chemicals side, just a couple of follow up questions. One, I'm just wondering if you could walk us through what the mix of input costs are there. I mean, I know you talked about freight potentially being higher, but I'm wondering what that mix is, if you could remind us, and if some of those are actually locked in for this year.", "E. Rajkowski", "Bill, what drove the inflation in the first quarter was largely freight. As well as, we do have some fairly extensive petroleum based inputs as well. And so those were the key drivers on the inflationary side. We do have certain raw materials where we have locked in pricing for 2011. So we feel good about those.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Okay. And then on the volume side, you had talked, in response to a previous question, about capacity expansions that you've made. Do you have any volume constraints at this point? I mean, if demand were to continue in this double digit range, would you be able to handle that with the existing capacity?", "E. Rajkowski", "We can. We have some products that we would actually, we call it derivatization, we would add value to those and start to drive the product mix. So our refineries are fairly full, but our downstream capabilities, we continue to have opportunities to drive increased volume of final products and drive our mix up as a result of that.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Got it. Okay.  Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America.", "George Staphos", "I had, I guess, 3 general areas of questions. I'll try to keep it tight because it's the end of the call here or towards the end of the call. One on Brazil, one on PRG and then just one on productivity. I guess first on Brazil. You mentioned that you're seeing some signs of deceleration in the market. I'm not sure if that's the word you used, but that's what you were suggesting. Does that change at all the strategy around Rigesa in terms of what you've been expecting? And can you comment at all? There have been some fairly large, at least, projections of capacity increases in South America more broadly in containerboard. Does that affect that at all how you'd expect performance in Rigesa should proceed over the next couple years?", "John Luke", "George, I'll take that one. Look, I think that we continue to feel very, very bullish about the opportunities in the near and longer term in Brazil for all the reasons that we've talked about. The word I used was moderation. And that's moderation a year [ph] from the pretty heavy growth rates we've seen there over the course of the past year. And I think as we're all aware, what we're seeing is a little bit of an uptick in inflation, a little bit of concerns among consumers broadly in the country that's going to put to test the new government. But their responses to date certainly seem to be sound and constructive. And what we're seeing in our own markets is good opportunities for the profitable participation that is embedded in our strategy. And for the longer haul, as Jim noted, we're on target with the expansion work, and we continue to be very, very positive about the opportunities for participation. Again, as we've said, we've been operating there for several decades, and the market participation we have has been carefully built and will be extended upon as that market grows over time and as we expand in other areas where the value that our packaging can bring to the market exists.", "George Staphos", "Okay. On PRG, I seem to remember last quarter there were some shipments that you missed that was related to export vessel availability. I think you had the same factor here. But were you able to recover the volumes on those shipments last quarter? I kind of remember the number being about 1.5 points. And similarly, could you quantify at all what the effect of the volume you walked away from was in the quarter on a year on year basis for other CUK or bleached board?", "James Buzzard", "Sure, George. This is Jim. We did pick up    I would say those terms have drifted from the fourth quarter. We picked them up on the first quarter on the export shipments. But we continue to have issues around the transportation system as others are as well. In terms of the business that we exited from, it was    it impacted us probably around 13,000 tons, as I recall, in the first quarter.", "George Staphos", "Okay, thanks for that, Jim. And the last question    actually, I'm going to switch gears. I'm going to go to dispensing systems. Other peers that you have, have been implementing their own end market reorganization now, they'd been setting up for maybe a year or 2. You're just beginning, I guess, this process. What do you expect to learn from this? What sales reorganization might you need to do to fully put this into place? Do you have any view on what kind of cost may be associated with the realignment once you're all said and done? Thanks, guys, and good luck in the quarter.", "John Luke", "George, thanks you very much. Let me comment on broadly. We have been actively working over the last several quarters to address those questions so that the time we finalize the changes in organization that we've talked about and resulting segment reporting, all of those things will be nicely in place. And we will be    we have worked very hard to ensure that as we've done that, that we have realigned both the calling efforts as well as the capabilities of our frontline commercial organization. What we expect to get out of that even more than we are today is a much better understanding of the trends, the growth rates, the product development, innovation opportunities in the market essentially with a reorganization of the sort we're talking to really develop a level of expertise market by market, customer by customer of strategies that our customers have. And with it, strategies that we should be refining to ensure that the participation plan that we develop are going to be ones that are going to yield results that are expected by our shareholders.", "Operator", "And we have no more questions in queue.", "John Luke", "Okay. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter.", "E. Rajkowski", "You can give out the replay information please, Tara.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay at 12 p.m. Central Standard Time today through Friday, May 27, 2011.

Morgan", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "", "Operator", "Good morning. My name is Rosy and I will be your conferenceoperator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Rock-TennFourth Quarter 2007 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder,ladies and gentlemen this call is being recorded today, November 8, 2007. Thankyou.", "Your speakers for today's call are Mr. Steven Voorhees,Chief Financial Officer and Mr. James Rubright, Chairman and Chief ExecutiveOfficer. Mr. Voorhees, you may begin your conference.", "Steven Voorhees", "Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to Rock-Tenn's conferencecall. During the course of the conference call we may make statements that arenot historical in nature and may involve forward-looking statements within themeaning of federal securities laws. For example, statements regarding ourplans, expectations, estimates, and beliefs related to future events areforward-looking statements, which involve a number of risks and uncertainties,many of which are beyond our control and that could cause actual results todiffer materially from those discussed.", "Additional information regarding these risks anduncertainties is contained in the documents we filed with SEC. These documentsinclude the Company's Form 10-K filed for the year ended September 30, 2006 andthe 10-Qs filed for the quarters ended December 2006, March 2007, and June2007. ", "During the call, we will be referring to non-GAAP financialmeasures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directlycomparable GAAP measures are contained in our press release, which is availableon Rock-Tenn's website at rocktenn.com.", "Let me now turn to Rock-Tenn's results for the quarter.Rock-Tenn's fourth-quarter net sales were $605 million, up $35 million or 6.2%when compared to last year's fourth quarter. Segment income of $54.2 millionwas $3.7 million higher than we reported in the same quarter of last year.", "Rock-Tenn reported fourth-quarter net income of $19.7million, $0.50 per share. ", "I'd like to call your attention to two items that areincluded in this quarter's result. The first item is restructuring cost of $2.4million, $0.4 per shares. This is primarily from the closure of the Stone Mountain folding carton plant announced in June ofthis year. The second item is the $1.7 million or $0.3 per share impact of thedowntime associated with planned increase in the capacity of our Battle Creek coatedrecycle board mill. This project increased Battle Creek's annual capacity by 11%. Thisamounts for 16,000 tons per year.", "During the September quarter of last year, the companyrecorded $0.1 of expense in restructuring charges and $0.6 of income fromreview of our state tax provision. After adjusting for these items, we arereporting $0.57 on adjusted EPS of $0.5 improvement over the $0.52 adjusted EPSrecorded last year.", "Realized prices for all paperboard and pulp grade increased$36 per ton over the last year's fourth quarter. On a sequential quarter basis,average prices for all paperboard and pulp grade increased $9.00 per ton.", "Turning to energy cost. Energy cost were up about $1 millionin the quarter. This was primarily due to the expiration of the long-term steamcontract at our St. Paulmill.", "Based on current market conditions, the average NYMEXclosing price for the December quarter will be about $0.50 higher than the$6.56 per mmbtu; NYMEX closing price in the December quarter of last year. Wedo not have any natural gas hedge positions on for the winter.", "Rock-Tenn's cost of recycle fiber was $137 per ton in thequarter. This is up $36 per ton over the last year, and up $10 per ton from theJune quarter fiber cost of $127 per ton. As a result, our recycled fiber costswere $10 million higher than in the same quarter of last year.", "Markets for recycled fiber continued to be higher than lastyear. The November index of OCC in Chicagois $110 per ton, as compared to the average index of $62 in the Decemberquarter of 2006.", "[Paper] products were $1.9 million lower than last year.This continues to reflect the trend from previous quarters of our processimprovement programs regarding our transportation management.", "The company bought back $2.1 million shares of Rock-Tennstock in the quarter, at an average price of $27.41 per share. We currentlyhave $38 million shares outstanding. This is approximately the same number aswe had outstanding one year ago. Our share repurchases have offset the newshares that we've issued from option exercises.", "We generated $97 million of operating cash flow in thequarter. This allowed us to fund the share repurchases of $58.7 million,capital expenditures of $19.3 million, pay our dividend of $4 million and stillpay down $11 million in debt. Rock-Tenn's $97 million in operating cash flow inthe September quarter was $42 million more than in the same quarter of last year.Much of this improvement was from improved working capital management,particularly in the receivables and payables categories.", "The Company's credit agreement debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.55times as of September 30, 2007. When we filed our 10-K for this fiscal year, wewill have achieved a credit agreement debt-to-EBITDA ratio below 3 points fortwo consecutive quarters. We will have a right to cause the release of the lienon our Senior Credit Facility.", "Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $19.3 million.Our capital expenditure for the year was $78 million, which is well below ourannual depreciation and amortization of $104 million. For the fiscal year 2008,we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $75 million.", "Rock-Tenn's financial results for the year reflect recordresults for our business. Rock-Tenn's credit agreement-to-EBITDA is $286.5million, which is 12.4% of sales. Our segment income was $211 million, our netincome was $82 million, and our EPS $2.07 or $2.17 on an unadjusted basis.", "We will now turn to our operating results and outlook, andJim will cover that. Jim?", "James Rubright", "Thank you, Steve. Our business has really performed well inthe fourth quarter. $0.57 in adjusted earnings is at the high end of what we expectedto achieve given the high fiber prices that we saw at the outset of the quarterand that is expected to continue through the quarter.", "Our operating result for the segment level was very good,showing continued growth in the underlying profitability of our businesses. AsSteve mentioned, total segment earnings were up in the quarter $3.7 million to$54 million with each of our segments posting higher earnings on year-over-yearquarter basis.", "The reduction in segment earnings from third quarter of 2007can really be explained by two events. The fist one is the outage at our BattleCreek Mill, which Steve has mentioned, and the second is higher recycled fiberpricing, which were $10 higher per tone in the fourth quarter than they were inthe third quarter. The results that we produced were really a function ofexcellent execution of our operating strategies.", "I want to start with packaging. In folding cartons, we saw asmall improvement in return on sales, even though physical volumes were downslightly. So, we mentioned our strategies to continue to focus on visits thatwe can make money on in connection with the planned rationalization that we putin place, following the Gulf Statesacquisition that was part of our integration plan.", "In addition, our cost reduction in productivity initiativeswere mostly evident in the packaging sector, where as I mentioned, wemaintained margins, even though board price increases substantially affected inputcosts.", "The issue for cost reduction in our businesses, and what wesee from our competitor is really not how much cost reduction you can get, buthow much net cost reduction you can achieve, net cost reduction versus theunderlying inflation of your businesses. We view inflation not as commodityprice changes, fiber prices and energy prices. Those are commodity input coststhat are in cyclical and which will vary, but the underlying inflation, such aswages, healthcare cost, insurance and alike. We believe that the result of allour cost reduction and productivity initiatives outpaced underlying inflationduring the year by about $14 million, which we think is a significantachievement.", "In last quarter's call, we said we expected to see continuedrecovery of paperboard price increases in the fourth quarter. We did achievehigher pricing in the quarter, which as Steve said, was about $9 per ton overall [grades]. ", "The reason, I think, why we are at the high end of ourexpectation going into this quarter, is that we did very well in continuing torecover from price increases from our paperboard mills.", "But in addition, the productivity of our mills wasexceptional in a period of strong demand. We again took no economic downturn inour bleached board, coated recycled board, corrugated medium and gypsum linermills. And our total tons produced in the quarter were very strong given theplanned capital outage at our Battle  Creek Mill.", "Demand for corrugated packaging and merchandizing displayscontinued to be very good during the quarter. And we also did well there,particularly in the corrugated business, passing through higher paper costs, aswe did as well in displays. Volumes at our corrugators and displaymanufacturing continued to grow, and of course in Alliance we had record sales of $85.5million.", "As we noted in our press release, we are increasing thestated capacity of our paperboard mills, since we're continuing to producepaperboard at rates that exceed our previously stated capacity. We'reincreasing what we believe to be our stated capacity by 62,500 tons per year,which is a 4% increase.", "The largest increase is at our Battle Creek Mill, wherein the Septemberproject we referred to was very successful, increasing capacity by at least the16,000 tons that we stated. Battle  Creek manufactures a premium grade of coated recycledboard with what many of our customers tell us was the best recycled printingsurface in the industry. ", "Fortunately, it\u2019s a big machine, it's just got bigger, andit has very low operating cost that just got lower.", "There were a large number of other capital projects andother productive gains that account for the balance of the increase incapacity, all of which is in paperboard grade where we have been sold out forsome time.", "As Steve mentioned, we brought back 2 million shares of ourcommon stock at $27.41 per share, which is somewhat above yesterday's closingprice. Put this in perspective, from our view, as we looked at the transaction,$27.41 per share is 13 times 2007 earnings. $27.41 is also only 6.5 times 2007cash flow from operations less CapEx. We saw that the investment on our ownequity is compelling. This raises the question of how we see businessconditions going forward. Demand for paperboard, packaging and displays allstarted out strong in our first quarter and mill backlogs from bleached andcoated recycled board remained strong. We also expect to recover more priceincreases in the next quarter and next year.", "First, last quarter we had just begun recovering our Julyannouncement of $40 per ton on bleached paperboard. And as you know, we expectto produce about 330,000 tons of bleached board in 2008. We expect to continueto recover some coated recycled board price from our previous announcementslast year, under deferred price adjustment provisions in some of our larger contracts.", "We also have just begun recovering in September the $40 perton increase on corrugated medium that was announced last summer. Our averagecorrugated medium pricing will increase in the December quarter.", "Fourth quarter is typically our seasonally weaker salesquarter as in November and December demand for products reduces with outagesand downtime at our customers and our results in that quarter are reduced bythe annual outage of our bleached board mill. But we have completed thatoutage. It was completed in October, and it was very well executed although itwas a large outage and the startup went well. So, the financial impact of the outageshould be consistent with our expectations and consistent with last year'sexperience.", "In our folding carton business, demand for our productsstarted out again very strong in the quarter, we were pleased to see, and weessentially have completed the folding carton integration and restructuringthat we undertook following the Gulf States acquisition. So, we do not expect toincur any significant or material restructuring costs in fiscal 2008 from the foldplant closures that we -- affected as a result of the Gulf State'stransaction.", "Recycle fiber pricing continues to be relatively high on a historicalbasis, but the most recent market movement was down and therefore in our favor.Currently we are seeing some contraction in transaction spreads of publishedindex prices. So, we expect to see some further moderation in fiber cost nextmonth in November and through the quarter on seasonally stronger generation andcurrent global sourcing trends.", "Last, in summary, if demand for our products does not morethan continue at current levels, we believe we are well positioned to post anotheryear of sales and earning growth and strong cash flow.", "That concludes the prepared remarks that Steve and I had,and we are now -- would welcome questions.", "Question-and-AnswerSession", "", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comesfrom Mark Connelly of Credit Suisse.", "Mark Connelly -Credit Suisse ", "(inaudible).", "Operator", "Excuse me sir, we can barely hear you.", "Steven Voorhees", "Operator we cannot hear the question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mr. Bill Hoffman of UBS.", "Bill Hoffman - UBS", "Yes, good morning. Just a couple of questions just on sortof business conditions, you mentioned some of the pricing pass-through here,that you are seeing in the fiscal fourth quarter. Does it feel like businessconditions are tight enough where you can gather further price momentum goinginto 2008? Obviously given the seasonality, it makes it a little more difficultto know that, but we're just trying to get a sense on how tight marketconditions feel in the CRB business?", "Steven Voorhees", "Right Bill, I cannot comment on the prospect for furtherprice increases for legal reasons, and so I will not do so. But the conditionsin our paperboard mills, with the exception of the uncoated mills, which as youknow, the small exposure that we have are very strong. Our CRB mill backlogs byhistorical standards continue to be very strong, and bleach board have actuallyincreased over the last, I'd say 6 to 8 weeks. So, the underlying demand forpaperboard and the apparent supply-demand balance in North America for the grades that we manufacture appears to be verystrong.", "Bill Hoffman - UBS", "Thanks. And just with regards to the URB side of theequation, it's obviously a small piece, and you are seeing some softness there.Strategically what are you doing with regards to that market, are youstraddling that capacity or production at this point?", "James Rubright", "No, about half of our capacity in uncoated recycled boardgoes to our own converting operations and businesses that arestable-to-improving. The largest single exposure that we have in uncoatedrecycled board is into our interior packing joint venture with Sonoco.", "Bill Hoffman - UBS", "Right.", "James Rubright", "The area that the end market for that product is the largestend markets or beverage markets for wine and beer, and those markets arehealthy and we continue to grow share in those markets. We also have adedicated mill that is a -- essentially it\u2019s a small mill, it\u2019s a book covermill, which has continued. The markets continue to be fine and our laminatedpaperboard business continues to be okay.", "So the weaknesses in that portion of our business thatserves the independent tube and core manufacturers and our operating rates arein the 89%, 90% overall in those mills. So, we are not ready to position ourcapacity rationalization, for us would not make any sense. All of our mills areprofitable and they have cash flowing to us. But I think people are aware thattube and core markets for example, because there are some fairly large publiccompanies where that exposure is material, are probably the weaker sector thatwe have exposure to.", "Bill Hoffman - UBS", "All right, okay. And then just final question, as you lookforward, you mentioned $75 million of capital spending in 2008. Do you have anyother thoughts on allocations of capital, for your bolt-on type acquisitions orany other direction on further share buybacks?", "Steven Voorhees", "Yes, we think that there are acquisition opportunities outthere that we will see as we talked about in the past, they tend to beepisodic. But it really is a question of the use of our capital, if the currentmarket conditions prevail it certainly makes our equity a compellingopportunity for us, but we haven\u2019t made a decision at the present timeregarding our plan.", "Bill Hoffman - UBS", "Okay. Thank you.", "Steven Voorhees", "Thank you, Bill.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mr. [Taylor Hood] of J.P.Morgan.", "Taylor Hood - J.P.Morgan", "Good morning.", "Steven Voorhees", "Hi Taylor.", "Taylor Hood - J.P.Morgan", "Good morning. I know this place is a little bit of a lumpybusiness. But can you give us a sense of just how things are shaping up to thefirst couple of weeks of the fourth quarter here?", "James Rubright", "Yes, basically I've said all of our businesses look good andI think Alliancedisplay through growth in its underlying customer base and a strong commitmentof existing customer base. It appears over the last, at least nine to twelvemonths that in-store display will continue to drive that business at a higherlevel of sales than last year, or let's say 2006. So, I think that you areseeing Alliancegrow to new level. It is a little lumpy as you commented.", "Margins were not as high at this quarter as they were twoquarter ago in similar sales. We had some larger than expected expenses inconnection with large display program and had some expenses further developingour (inaudible) display program. So, we had some expenses not associated withany revenues that were booked in this quarter. So, that affected the margin. Ithink the overall margin environment for the business is essentially unchanged,but I think that we are probably taking this business to a higher level ofsales than we would have seen in 2005 and 2006.", "Taylor Hood - J.P.Morgan", "Okay, so if we look in at 2008, that average margin levelfor 2007 would probably be sustainable as you stand here and look out over2008?", "James Rubright", "Yeah. If we see the sales at the same level, we think themargins are sustainable and we hope to be able to do some cost improvements andactually improve the margins somewhat. The hardest thing for us, Taylor is wedon't have visibility far into the order pattern change. So, but I think if thecustomer behavior continues into 2008, the statement you said about our marginis correct.", "Taylor Hood - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, great. And then non-allocated expense is a little bithigher than we had in our model this quarter. How should we think about thisrolling into 2008?", "Steve Voorhees", "It's about $6.5 million this quarter, there were some, kindof true ups of accruals or in some other, what I'd classify as non-recurringexpenses. I think going forward, I would look forward in to a $5.5 to $6million per quarter range, which is a little bit higher than we've had inhistorical period.", "Taylor Hood - J.P.Morgan", "Okay, great. And just lastly, how many shares are left onyour re-purchase authorization?", "Steve Voorhees", "That\u2019s 1.9 million.", "Taylor Hood - J.P.Morgan", "1.9. Thanks very much.", "James Rubright", "Thank you, Taylor.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from Mr. ChristopherChun of Deutsche Bank.", "Christopher Chun -Deutsche Bank.", "Thanks. Good morning guys. Just following up on that lastquestion, with the stock down at current levels, I'm wondering, I know youcan't speak for the entire board but, how do you feel Jim about expanding there-purchase authorization and how would you weigh that, versus other uses ofyour cash?", "Steve Voorhees", "Well Chris, I'd like amplify that, but I really think Ianswered it before by saying we have not made a specific decision beyond, over2 million shares that we've just purchased. But if it was attractive at 27 it'smore attractive at 25, it's probably more attractive at prices higher than thatgiven the cash flow generation that we've got, what opportunities do you haveat 6.5 time free cash flow.", "Christopher Chun -Deutsche Bank.", "Okay. And then in terms of your paperboard capacityincrease, can you give you us a little more color on what grade capacityincreasing?", "Steve Voorhees", "Chris, I am sorry we are having a little difficulty hearingyou. Would you mind repeating that question?", "Christopher Chun -Deutsche Bank.", "I am sorry. Can you hear me now?", "James Rubright", "Yes.", "Christopher Chun -Deutsche Bank.", "I was just wondering about your 62,500 tons per year ofcapacity increase. What grades are those effects?", "Steve Voorhees", "It is primarily everything other than, primarily everythingother than URB. There is an increase in both bleached and market pulp. Largestsince CRB and then the joint venture with [charge] for this gypsum linermachine, which was increased as a result of the capital project that wecompleted this summer. We have very specific data in our 10-K that we are aboutto file, but and after this call, we will just go over where the specificchanges about what you said.", "Christopher Chun -Deutsche Bank.", "Okay, great. And Jim, you talked about the fact that thereshould be some tail still left on some previously announced price hikes. Canyou give us an idea of approximately how much, what percentage you've achievedto date and what remains left in the different grades?", "James Rubright", "The CRB price increases have been pretty much passedthrough, but we will recover, I think, in the $1 million to $2 million range inthe next quarter on CRB. But as I mentioned, the bleached board and medium youshould see the majority of that effect in the December quarter, because theJuly announcement really started to get recovered in early August on bleachedboard and then medium we started to get back either in the end of September orearly October depending. I just can't remember exactly how those contractsflowed in. So on the medium increase of $40 a ton really haven't seen that one,and you are not seeing the majority of the effect on the announced bleachedboard increase.", "Christopher Chun -Deutsche Bank.", "Okay, and then looking ahead to the December quarter lastyear, your adjusted EPS fell by $0.12 based on seasonal factors and youmentioned that there is still price to come and your outage went well. So,would it be fair to say that the quarter-over-quarter decline might a bit lessthan that this time or is it a too soon to make that call?", "James Rubright", "Well, first of all, we don't give specific earnings guidanceand we also don't know the extent of the seasonal effect, it is a function of orderpatterns, primarily in our packaging businesses in November and December, towhich we have no visibility. So, you and I can sort of reason out where wethink it is sort of, but it is not something we like to give specific guidanceon.", "Christopher Chun -Deutsche Bank.", "Okay, fair enough. And then finally Jim, with the EconomicNews lately, there has been a really fast decline of the U.S. dollar relativeto some other major currencies and I was wondering what your perspective was onhow and to what extent that will affect to Rock-Tenn?", "James Rubright", "It's had a very positive effect over the last 12 to 18months. As you know, the SBS bleached paperboard is an exported commodity. Andthe important thing for that is, it has a larger installed base in either CUKor CRB, and our view is that those grades effectively make up one large foldingcarton board market and, so the \u2013 but with a difference that SBS is the premiumgrade and the world assured SBS outside of the United States. The exportabilityof that commodity is one of the principal factors that affect the profitabilityof not only that grade which we make, but also the recycled paperboard. So, thecontinuing weakness of the dollar seems to us to be a positive for Rock-Tenn.", "In addition, the strength of the Canadian dollar relative tothe U.S. dollar net, is positive to us, because of its affect, again, onrecycled paperboard pricing. As you know, the Canadian economy has performedvery well, but it's killing its forest products industry and the relativecompetitiveness of the fairly significant amount of coated recycled paperboardcapacity in Canadais affected by the relative dollar movement. So, I think we, I would say thatas a North American, particularly U.S. producer of paperboard of all grades, aweak dollar has certainly continued to have the wind behind the demand, behindour back as far demand and pricing of our paperboard is concerned.", "Christopher Chun -Deutsche Bank.", "Great. Thanks for your help.", "Steve Voorhees", "To offer you a perspective, there are potential importsthreats because other people in the world make paperboard, other people in theworld can make folding cartons, but all of those factors, I think, continued toenhance the competitiveness, not only of our own manufacturing but of thedownstream manufacturing in the United States by our customers, which may endup over the long run being the most positive of all the trends.", "Christopher Chun -Deutsche Bank.", "Right. That\u2019s very helpful Jim. Thank you.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time.", "James Rubright", "Thank you very much for joining us on our call. We lookforward to speaking with you over the course of the quarter and then nextquarter. Thank you.", "Operator", "Than you for joining today's conference call.

My name is Trey and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Rock-Tenn first quarter 2008 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this call is being recorded today, January 24th, 2008. (Operator Instructions). Thank you.", "Your speakers for today's call are Mr. Steven Voorhees, Chief Financial Officer and Mr. James Rubright, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Voorhees, you may begin your conference.", "Steven Voorhees", "Thanks Trey. Good morning. Welcome to Rock-Tenn's fiscal first quarter 2008 conference call. During the course of the conference call, we may make statements that are not historical in nature and may involve forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. For example, statements regarding our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events are forward-looking statements which involve a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed. ", "Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties is contained in the documents that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents include the Company's Form 10-K filed for the year ended September 30, 2006. During the call we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are contained in the first quarter press release, which is available on Rock-Tenn's website at rocktenn.com.", "Let's turn to Rock-Tenn's results for the quarter. Rock-Tenn's first quarter net sales were $596.3 million, up $62.4 million, or 11.7% when compared to last year's first quarter. Segment income of $48 million was $5.5 million higher than we reported in the same quarter of last year, an increase of 12.9%.", "Rock-Tenn reported first quarter net income of $17.5 million, this is $0.46 per share. The $0.46 includes $3 million in pretax restructuring cost or $0.05 per share for the closure of Chicopee folding carton plant that is discussed in the press release and will be discussed in more detail by Jim in his comments.", "During the December quarter of last year Rock-Tenn recorded $0.5 million or $0.01 per share of expense in restructuring charges. Realized prices for all paper board and pulp grade increased $41 per ton over last year's first quarter.", "Turning to energy costs, energy costs were up $1.9 million in the quarter. Based on current market conditions the March quarter of this year will be in the range of $7.50 per MBTU. This is about $0.75 higher than the $6.76 per MBTU [non-exposing] price in the March quarter of last year.", "We do not have any natural gas hedge positions on for the winter or this coming summer season. Rock-Tenn's cost of recycled fiber was $139 per ton in the quarter. This is up $49 per ton over the last year, an increase of approximately $12.5 million over the prior year quarter. That comes cost of recycled fiber in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 was up only $2 per ton from the December quarter fiber cost of $137 per ton. ", "Markets for recycled fiber are down slightly from the December quarter, although higher than the last year. The January index for OCC in Chicago is $110 per ton, as compared to the average index of $93 per ton in the March quarter of 2007 and a $112 per ton in the December quarter of 2007.", "Chemical cost, some of which changes in oil prices were up $ 2.6 million in our paperboard segment. That number compares cost in this quarter versus same quarter of last year. Freight costs were $300,000 higher than last year and 11.7% increase in net sales. This reflects a continuation from previous quarters of our process improvement programs regarding our transportation management.", "Rock-Tenn did not buyback any shares during the quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 was $22.3 million compared to $32.3 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction of non-debt current liabilities in the current year quarter.", "The Company's credit agreement debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.57 times as of December 31, 2007, based on Credit Agreement EBITDA for the 12 months ending December 31, 2007 of $293 million. We have $35.6 million of cash on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter. An unusually high amount for us due to cash received at the end of quarter that was not applied to debt repayment.", "The credit agreement debt to EBITDA ratio does not give us credit for cash on hand and would have been lower for cash was used to pay down debt at December 31.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter were $17.9 million, below Rock-Tenn's depreciation and amortization of $25.8 million. For fiscal year 2008, we expect Rock-Tenn's legacy capital expenditures to be in the range of $75 to $80 million and in the range of $90 to $95 million assuming that the Southern Container acquisition closes in March.", "Rock-Tenn's effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 was approximately 32%, which is lower than the 35.5% effective rate, we expect for the full fiscal year and somewhat higher than the 29% rate in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007. We expect our annual pension expense to decrease to approximately 8 million down from 13.3 million in fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2008, we expect to contribute approximately 23 million to our five qualified defined benefit plans.", "Rock-Tenn's financial results for the past 12 months reflect record results for our business. Rock-Tenn's credit agreement EBITDA was 293 million or 12% of sales. Segment income was 216 million. Net income was 84 million and EPS of $2.14 per diluted share before adding back restructuring and other costs of 7.2 million.", "Jim will now discuss our operating results and outlook", "James Rubright", "Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all for joining our call. The first quarter 2008 was just another really good quarter across the board in all of our businesses. We started off with great sales in all four of our business segment. Sales in consumer products were up 8%, sales in paperboard were up 11%, merchandising displays up 35%, and corrugated packaging sales up 13% over the prior year quarter.", "We have continued to recover price increases in all of our segments, which contributed largely to the sales increases, but we also had volume growth in all four segment. The volume growth was strongest in our merchandising display segment. In our paperboard division, we also had a shift in mix from recycled board to bleach board, which helped our margins and resulted in part from continuing improvements in the operating performance of our Demopolis bleach board mill. Our consumer packaging business performed very well in the quarter.", "Sales growth, as I mentioned were strong, largely price recovery, volumetrically it was up about 2.5% from the prior year. The most significant factor about the quarter is that we achieved our 5% return on sales target, which we established, when we acquired Gulf States assets little more than two years ago, but we did it in the December quarter, which is seasonally by far the weakest quarter for our Folding Carton business.", "The main factors that contribute to our success in achieving our margin goal are the results of two programs that we started about two-and-a-half years ago. One is operational excellence, which focuses on optimizing and standardizing our operating functions. And the second is an equipment utilization project, which essentially matches our existing business to the optimum operating environment for us Rock-Tenn. We have seen great improvements from both programs, both reducing costs and then creating open capacity that is itself very low cost.", "In addition, we are continuing to realize benefits from the execution and delivery of synergies from the Gulf States acquisitions and we are also seeing the benefits of the application of capital that we made overtime in this business [from] cost reducing technologies across the board.", "Finally in the December quarter, there were no significant LIFO charges, which we had been experiencing through the course of the last year, as our board price increases to-date with the exception of the most recent announcement they have been passed through the Folding Carton business. As Steve mentioned and which goes in the press release, we announced yesterday the closing of our Chicopee, Massachusetts Folding Carton plant.", "We have been operating in the northeastern United States two Folding Carton plants that each have less than $30 million in sales, and then operate in general Folding Carton markets. We cannot just by reinvesting in both plants given the past capacity that you effectively create with new investments in printing technology given the fact that we have very large plants in eastern Canada and North Carolina both of which have open operating capacity that's been created by the operating initiatives I refer to above.", "With respect to this plant closure, as Steve mentioned, we recorded about $3 million in restructuring expense in the last quarter and we will record about a $1.3 million in subsequent quarters as we [first incurred]. The actual out-of-pocket costs of the closing that we will incur will be about $1.5 million after-tax. However, due to the capital avoidance, we will experience from the redeployment of the vest assets from this closed plant and we expect that proceeds from the sale of the building will actually be cash positive, as a result of the closing about several million dollars that we will realize over the course of the next two years.", "From an operating standpoint, we expect to realize approximately $2 million in increased operating income, as a result of the closure. Thus by continuing to consolidate our business into large very well equipped modern plants that are operating at high utilization rates, we are continuing to generate increasing return on sales and a positive turnover in implied capital costs in our Folding Carton business.", "Turning to Paperboard, although Paperboard volumes were up slightly in the quarter over the last year operating income to the segment was down approximately $2 million from the prior year.", "Main driver was that the recycled fiber costs increased somewhat more than price recovery, more recycle grades, but particularly in our uncoated recycle grades.", "Operating rates across the division for uncoated grades were low and they were consistent with industry trends, where we're seeing weakness in operating rates which we've discussed.", "In addition, the annual outage at our Demopolis bleachboard mill was very well executed as was the startup, although the scope of the work that we undertook this year in the outage was much greater than the scope of the work in 2006. So the operating results in the 2007 quarter compared to 2006 tend to mask the significant year-over-year operating improvements we've achieved at this mill.", "In addition, as we noted in the press release during the quarter, we received about $1.7 million in recovery of previously expensed environmental costs, which were largely offset by about $1.3 million in operating losses in our Dallas mill, where we experienced significant disruptions from some dryer failures and a subsequent major dryer section rebuild.", "These disruptions accelerate the timing of the scheduled dryer rebuild at the mill and we also expanded its scope. Bright spot is we believe that we'll see some handsome payback from the rebuild both in reduced cost and added volume. And we've been seeing the benefits of those in the early weeks of January.", "Our display segment had a 35% sales increase in the December quarter over the prior year as I mentioned. Those were especially strong late in the quarter as well as we had a very strong month of December. Here we continued to see strong demand for promotional displays as well as the benefits continued growth in our customer platform.", "Our margins in the quarter were reduced somewhat by a less favorable overall mix and also by the startup of a new assemble facility that's related to the on boarding of a significant amount of new business from one of our largest customers. But we expect to see improvement in the margins that we generate from this incremental business over the course of the next few quarters.", "With good sales growth in our corrugated packing segment, sales were up 13% in quarter over the prior year quarter. With good demands, we have bookings for corrugated sheets and those for corrugators, and we've good packaging sales in our converting plants.", "Income of segments was up 22% based on mix and better asset utilization. When we close the acquisition of Southern Container, which we expect to do in the current quarter, we begin including the results for our St. Paul corrugated medium mill in our corrugated sector.", "St Paul medium mill ran further in the last quarter as it has from last several years taken only holiday contractual downtime. Demand for corrugated medium in North America continues to be very strong and capacity remains very tight.", "Looking forward to the balance of the year, demand continues to be good across all four of our business segments. Critically important for us is demand for paperboard. Our backlogs to bleachboard and clay-coated recycled boards are [off time]. All the industry today assures that North American bleached uncoated recycle mills can up strongly after the holiday downtime with initially very high operating rates.", "Equally important to this paperboard division results are the status and price initiatives and then summarize the activity that is public. First, we see published $30 increase on NBSK pulp that we will recover on January 1, 2008 on our 100,000 tons of annual productions with southern bleached softwood kraft pulp.", "Second, the three largest bleachboard producers and Rock-Tenn have each announced a $40 per ton increase for bleachboard folding grades to be effective in late February. Continued high operating rates and strong demands, as well as continued strong exports have led to favorable operating conditions for bleachboard.", "Lastly, all of the major uncoated recycled board manufactures have announced the $40 per ton increase on most grades of uncoated recycled board.", "Our two primary market mills for uncoated recycled board are located in Cincinnati, Ohio and Chattanooga, Tennessee. They have about a 150,000 tones per year of annual capacity. Operating rates in uncoated sector in North America, like these two that serve primarily tube and core, and other industrial applications have been relatively weak in 2007, the 80% range suggesting weak operating results in this sector.", "As the fiber costs increases as Steve discussed are particularly affecting this lower margin segment for the URB market and are driving its price increase. ", "I would note that we operate three other unquoted mills. Ones that are very small mills focused exclusively on solid fiber book covers and the other two are sold out. One is a mill that supplies our interior packaging and partition joint venture and the other one is sold out by contract to Gypsum Wallboard, manufacturer that's a JV partner in the mill.", "Now, converting businesses, demand for all of our converting products appears to continue to be good. Looking at the segments individually, consumer segment demand early in January is ahead of last year. We see very strong demand for merchandising display, where it is just a continuation of the growing demand in the sales patterns we similarly have experienced over most of last year.", "Our corrugated segment began the year with higher demand in the last year, particularly in our corrugators, which are generally good indicators of market conditions. Of course given the recent announcements of the acquisitions in Southern Container, this product category will assume much greater significance to us. Southern Containers has also reported good demand through the end of December and have been offset at this quarter.", "There is a strong demand for our converted products and our paperboards that goes in to those converting products. It's attributable, in fact, that on an overall basis, our businesses are focused on two paper and tissue, health, beauty and cosmetics, and consumer non-durables and all of those sectors continue to be very resilient in the current economic environment.", "Thus, we believe that the overall outlook for our business appears to be good with continuing prospects for the generation of strong cash flow that you have seen from us. Those were my prepared remarks and Steve and I are now welcome your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Mark Connelly of Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Suisse", "Thank you. Just two things. If we look over the last couple of years at both your coated board and your bleachboard businesses, there is a lot of stability in the volume numbers that you're showing. I wonder if you can give us any sense of what's happening underneath that in terms of the customer base, the relative size of accounts and whether there is any shift among those categories that you've talked about x Demopolis obviously. I'm just trying to get a sense of what's really happening out there because certainly the economy isn't as stable as what you are reporting?", "And my second question was just on the energy costs. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of sense of the energy costs in the quarter, and also how that mix of energy will change once you close Southern.", "Steven Voorhees", "Sure. I'll answer the first half and answer the second half. There is tremendous stability in the customer base both in the coated recycled mills and the bleachboard mill.", "James Rubright", "There has been very, very strong continuity; about half of it is internal and there is some mix in and out of North Folding Carton business. But that's a relatively stable customer. I'd say a very stable customer base and the same is true both in CRB and bleachboard.", "I acknowledge there has been a lot of movement in the sector, as you see I've referred to, but it hasn't really affected us. I think it is a tribute to the job that our people do in serving their customers and creating customer loyalty, so that at a market clearing price we're going to retain our customer base. We've got extremely low costs of quality in the division.", "So, the movement we've made, Mark, has primarily been on the margins looking to improve trends and looking to improve shifting. So, we're either working with our customer base or on the margin changing customers to increase margins and maximize the opportunity in half of our mills. But, I'd say on the whole, the stability has been very high. Steve, if you'd address the energy question.", "Steven Voorhees", "Mark, our energy usage pretty [southern] is about 9.5 Bcf per year; that's natural gas and fuel that would exclude electricity and so speaking primarily to boiler fuel.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Suisse", "Right.", "Steven Voorhees", "But, that mix is more. We had a steam contract at our St. Paul mill, which we reported last summer. The contract ended and we're now burning our natural gas and fuel at the St. Paul mill. Southern Container also has a steam contract, a long-term steam contract with our steam host, which is located adjacent to the Solvay mill. That steam is generated by coal and so, in fact, that represents a significant cost of damage for that mill. They do consume a small amount of natural gas and oil at their converting plants and the order of magnitude volumes about another half of Bcf.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Suisse", "Okay, okay. So, it doesn't sound like we're going to see any big swing, a real substantive swing in the overall mix of energy that you are purchasing?", "James Rubright", "Well, what -- I think the way I'd express it is that there is a big mix in the stack that are going to coal base rather than natural gas base energy at the..", "Mark Connelly - Credit Suisse", "Right for the steam, that's right.", "James Rubright", "Solvay mill and, but it's not a long-term contract with the price adjustor that's primarily based on CPI and a percentage of the delta in coal cost.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Suisse", "Right.", "James Rubright", "We actually have -- we're significantly increasing the overall stability and dampening the volatility of Rock-Tenn\u2019s overall energy cost mix.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Suisse", "Okay, okay. Thanks very much; that\u2019s helpful.", "Operator", "Claudia Hueston of JP Morgan. You may ask your question.", "Claudia Hueston - JP Morgan", "Hi, thanks a lot. Good morning.", "James Rubright", "Good morning ", "Claudia Hueston - JP Morgan", "I was encouraged to see the margin improvement in the Folding Carton business. And I just wondered if you could maybe talk a little bit about how sustainable you see that 5% sort of return on sales level? And then, do you think there is another leg up for margin improvement in that business, and, if so, how you are going to get there?", "James Rubright", "With respect to the first half, I think that the overall cost position of the business is much better than it would have been 24 months ago. So, I think I'd expect to see better margins over time than you'd have seen at the outset of the period for the average of the period, yes.", "And the returns are really not volume driven or market driven. These are real benefits of cost reduction and optimizing the business platform. So, I think they are sustainable in that sense. However, the business is highly sensitive to marginal volumes and we had good sales.", "As we've noted in the quarter, sales were up over the prior sequential quarter and in our December quarter they are flat to the previous September quarter. So, we had strong sales. So, that is definitely going to effect margins. So, if you have the strong sales quarters, it kind of shows up in the margin outlines.", "And do I think we are out of gas in terms of the ability to improve the productivity of those plants? No, I don\u2019t. I think the environment in which we have strong paperboard pricing, which we've had for now at least 24 months, generally favors the ability of the converting businesses to recover price increases. So, I think that has contributed to the benefits that you're seeing and as long as the paperboard markets stay tight, I think that will help the converters, Rock-Tenn included.", "Claudia Hueston - JP Morgan", "All right. That's really helpful. And then, I just wondered if you had any thoughts on recycled fiber in terms of where you sort of expect those costs to go over the course of 2008.", "James Rubright", "Yeah, Steve, go ahead.", "Steve Voorhees", "I think right now we're -- interesting market domestic prices are the spread between domestic prices and export prices is larger than it has been. And I think most people have sound memory. So, there is upward pressure. There are new mills coming online in China. We understand there is about 4.5 million tons of capacity coming around and they are in the course of the year.", "Over the past fiscal year for us the average OCC price was $93. I think we had expected that to increase. And I think as we get over the next few months, we're going to see where that settles out. If we had to estimate, we would see an increase of maybe $10 to $15 on an annual basis year-over-year; it would be where that would settle out.", "Claudia Hueston - JP Morgan", "Okay. Thanks. That's really helpful.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Christopher Chun of Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Yeah. Thanks. Good morning.", "James Rubright", "Morning, Chris.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Hey, Jim, just following up on your discussion of the price hike initiatives that are in the market, you've talked about pulp and bleached and uncoated, is there anything going on in the coated recycled side?", "James Rubright", "Nothing has been announced there, Chris.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Yeah. Okay. And then on container board, did this last quarter fully reflect the small price hike or is there anything still left?", "James Rubright", "That price hike was announced for October, so we began getting it early in the quarter, but we didn't have the full benefit of it. So, with respect to our corrugated medium mill, I believe there is a little bit that you saw primarily most of that increase in the mill.", "In the converting business, we are recovering early in the quarter, but again, it's pretty earlier in the quarter. So I don't have -- I can't give precise fraction. But I think that we did see the effect of that in the converting business as well.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then in terms of the $40 ton uncoated recycled hike, can you talk about over what time frame you expect to recover that?", "James Rubright", "Well, that's just a difficult subject to discuss for both competitive and any trust reason. So I am really not going to attempt to do that. Typically, as you know there is anywhere from three to six months period of time over which you recover price increases generally, either because of contractual limitations, market movements or just negotiations with your customers. But I can't comment specifically on this one.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And is that the typically three to six months lag similar for the bleached paperboard as well or is that different?", "James Rubright", "Well, some of it's going to get -- initially you spot transactions, your contractual -- where you don't have contractual limits you're going to get relatively, quickly, immediately. So I don't want to suggest that it\u2019s -- you know it's an average flow over three to six months. That's not right. But, what I am saying is until you ultimately get finished recovering all that you're going to get; it can take three to six months. The bleachboard is similar -- really depends upon the individual contracting state of the individual mill.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then in terms of your display business, it was up significantly year-over-year but I noticed that it was down a bit sequentially. Can you talk about through the normal seasonality that affects that business?", "James Rubright", "I can, and if you take that business overtime, the December quarter usually is the weakest quarter except when it's not. And, that's essentially what is happening. December in a way, in 2006 and 2007 were weak quarters seasonally, significantly weak. And that's true probably in three of the prior four years, but there was one year in which we had strong sales. 2008 continued the strong sales momentum that we saw in the fourth quarter.", "I'm speculating, my belief is, though, that given weakness in the economy, consumer products companies have turned on the -- I am just speaking with respect to product promotions in order to maintain sales volumes. Because my belief is that this business is somewhat counter cyclical to the rest of our businesses and that is there is less need to promote in the healthiest environments, where the consumer products companies issue is production and supply as opposed to growth demand.", "But the fact that it was down slightly from the prior quarters didn't trouble us because it was a tremendous sales rate for our December quarter.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And, finally, Jim, you talked about how this quarter was affected by the fact that the average at Demopolis involved more work this year compared to last year. Can you tell us, sort of, what the incremental impact from that was?", "James Rubright", "It will. I have been speculating, it's very hard to take that in parts and we might try to do a little bit more work on it. But, I think it's in the range of a couple of million dollars because we had about a 2.5 times as many people in the mill at the peak of the average work as we did the prior year. And, saying so significantly greater scope and what that's going to mean is higher maintenance expense, higher maintenance non-capitalized costs and then sort of greater disruption costs.", "But, the fact is I don't have a proxy to compare the analogy of this scope, under this management team against to really define what the additional operating expense or maintenance expense was and then compared to last year. My belief, however, is that the quarter, you can't really compare 2007 with 2008 apples-to-apples because of the scope of the work. And, therefore, while the mills operating results improved it was significantly greater improvement masked by the scope of the outage.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "All right. And going forward, would you expect future outages to look more like the '08 version or the '07 version?", "James Rubright", "Well, somewhere in the middle. They are not going to necessarily look like either because this is the year when we went into recovery boiler. So, this is going to be a large scale and you are not going to do that every year. So, this is going to be somewhere in the middle of it.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Yes, okay. Thanks for your help.", "Operator", "[Steven Nissan] of Mindflow Capital Investment. You may ask your ask your question.", "Steven Nissan - Mindflow Capital Investment", "Yeah, a couple of questions; Good job, Jim. You always seem to do well in this very challenging environment.", "James Rubright", "Thank you.", "Steven Nissan - Mindflow Capital Investment", "A couple of questions regarding your operation initiatives; Can you tell us about how you guys are really going to improve on your operational initiatives in terms of Lean CPM Six Sigma to overall improve on throughout?", "James Rubright", "Well, we can talk for a long time about that if you wanted to really.", "Steven Nissan - Mindflow Capital Investment", "No, I'll talk for forever. Maybe you give us.", "James Rubright", "Over the last, I guess, from the time I've been here we have trained well over 200 people in Lean Six Sigma. We've over twenty Six Sigma Black Belts, who are fulltime devoted to process improvement and Six Sigma projects in the company. We've got a substantial number and I don't know the exact number of part time Black Belt.", "And so, if I just try to count the number of projects that we were doing I don't -- tell you, it would be very difficult to do. But an average Black Belt is probably going to do two or three projects a year that are significant in terms of their potential impact of part time Black Belt pretty much as a commitment to do one project a year.", "So, you've a massive effort throughout the company applying Six Sigma and Lean technologies to the business and the process of generating the projects for those people is very detailed at the business unit level. So, you have an enormous opportunity said and you've a lot of people who essentially have a methodology that if we are familiar with the methodology it works very well in identifying opportunities to improve operating results and then uses essentially day-to-day decision making in designer [experiment] capacities to isolate ways -- to isolate new process and develop improvements.", "But in addition to that, the big thing we've done in the Folding Carton business that we're doing that sort of an ongoing project is what I referred to as capacity utilization. Rock-Tenn has been a very environmental, a very entrepreneurial oriented company and we've operated on a pretty disaggregated basis. But, particularly after the Gulf States transaction, we concluded that we really needed to operate the Folding Carton system, as one Folding Carton system and change the overall market approach.", "And, as a result, we're essentially re-pricing every piece of business from the largest, working our way ultimately, we will be down to the smallest piece of business determining exactly where that should run from an operating efficiency standpoint and then going to the -- trouble is actually putting it in that environment, which significantly reduces your cost, pretty significantly increases open capacity because you're creating, you're changing the efficiency with respect to the stuff that it runs.", "But, to do that you need to change the mentality or the culture of the people because it's a significant culturalship all of which is in place and is really paying dividends. So as much as Six Sigma, I think it\u2019s the different operating model that we've got in Folder Carton business, but that we're also looking at with respect to the other operations.", "Steven Nissan - Mindflow Capital Investment", "Right; in your manufacturing operations, how important are OEE and RONA to you and is that something that's critical to your business to measure your returns on your investment?", "James Rubright", "OEE, which if you are familiar with ROE, is really our Overall Equipment Effectiveness, and there is a new way of looking at our operations new to the way we've done it. We've got it from one of our customers and it's really worked well. But essentially you measure the performance of every piece of the equipment against perfection if that machine could run at a stated run speed then you multiply that time with 24 hours and 365 days and we would measure on months so it's a number of days and months or so. Okay, that's a 100%.", "What was your percent, how many sheets came out at the other end of the printer? And what it has done is changed peoples' aspiration of what's really possible. So, they are no longer saying well, I run 8000 sheets and somebody else ran [8200] therefore 8200 is the goal. The goal is maybe 20,000 right and you start attacking problems with a different perspective.", "So, in terms of the -- I think very significant operating improvements that we've made it's been critical because we've struggled with ways to make. But I'd think of as quantum changes in operating efficiencies overtime and this one is really working. So, I think it's critical that the results that we're producing, I couldn't be happier with the team that said this is the way we're going to do that and having successfully implemented it and just spreading across the company.", "Steven Nissan - Mindflow Capital Investment", "Now, as you are talking about, obviously you guys are right on track. But what are you doing to accelerate these initiatives? What types of systems implementation are you putting in place going forward to make sure you stay the leader in the industry?", "Steven Voorhees", "Well, I'd be happy to talk in more detail about that after this phone call. But I think it's been more detailed than I would with respect to the broad investor that we have here.", "Steven Nissan - Mindflow Capital Investment", "Okay. And then a final question for you. As we go into a very challenging economy, possible recession for mid of '08, how do you -- Jim, as I see your Rock-Tenn, plan to stay a leader in the industry, improve shareholder value and just overall with this costs and make everyone happy that they are investors in your company.", "James Rubright", "Well, our strategy has been to; number one, focus on a combination of very high customer satisfaction and very high quality and very low cost. And we'll continue that discipline and focus. The question about, do we see a recession coming, I don't know whether there is a recession coming in or not. I believe because of the mix of our business in food, which is probably 62% or two-thirds of the food and beverage of the overall business mix of Rock-Tenn.", "And, then consumer non-durable mix of our businesses, we are likely to have greater resiliency than many sectors of the economy in times of economic downturn. So, I frankly believe that we're well positioned relative to American industry generally to do well in this environment.", "Steven Nissan - Mindflow Capital Investment", "Good. Thank you very much. Continued success down the road.", "James Rubright", "Thank you.", "Operator", "[David Gutterman of Bowen Research], you may ask your question. (Operator Instructions).", "Our next question comes from Kevin Casey at Casey Capital. You may ask your question.", "Kevin Casey - Casey Capital", "Hi, guys. A question kind of on that last one about recession maybe, maybe not. Can you talk about have you changed the way you think about managing cash and cash flow, your different priorities for that? And then, can you just remind us what will be the length of the priorities.", "James Rubright", "Sure, Kevin. The answer is we have not made any change. First of all, we don't reductions in our volumes; the volume growth in our business is continued. And, as I indicated, through January our business has actually looked very good, but we operate our businesses with the view of generating cash.", "As we've talked about in the past, we essentially make every decision based on today's present value of the future expected cash flows of that decision over the long-term, so we don't manage our business with short-term, whether we are in a recessionary environment or growth environment, our decisions are ultimately made on the base driven by the same basic principal. And, that is to not respond to short-term factors.", "In our case, the priority for the application of cash since the cost base application has been to reduce debt, after we met the needs of our business, as you know our commitment is to investment in our assets investing our business. And I think we've done that. Particularly, we did it through the last downturn in year 2000 period of time and I think those decisions are should be consistent in applying technology, and the businesses are paying dividends today.", "But, we are maintaining our assets great. We have the most cost effective assets in the marketplace to attack our business. It's never going to use our excess cash flow. [We will say] there has been significant amount overtime to reduce debt. The acquisition of Southern Container puts us in a position where our debt level goes back up.", "There is something like 4.1 times debt to EBITDA, which is historically at the range we said is acceptable, but a range in which we would be highly focused on that reduction. So I think you will see us over the course of the next two years very focused on executing that acquisition as we did Gulf States, executing the business plans of that business and then taking that cash and applying it to debt reduction.", "Kevin Casey - Casey Capital", "Okay. And then the follow-up, and it actually has been asked anyway, can you talk about having the most cost competitive facilities, do you think you, like, I mean obviously there are tons of facilities but do you think your overall portfolio facilities is more competitive than the competition?", "James Rubright", "Well, I do, yes. If you look at our performance over the last 24 months and then we've our peer group. I just take the other people, who are in our business, look at the performance of the other companies, for example, that are in the Folding Carton business. I'll have to believe that our people and our assets are generating returns that our performance over that cycle is better than the competition. So, something is got to be driving those results and those returns.", "In addition, we've got industry, principal assets or mills then you've got industry cost cuts that you can pretty well compare where you stand versus all of you competitors from a cost standpoint. And I'd tell you that Demopolis is a very low cost mill, maybe the lowest cost bleachboard mill in the United States and is focused on folding grades, which is exactly where we want it.", "So, that is, I think, our Battle Creek, Michigan mill is one of the two lowest cost recycled board mills in America. It's a large mill. St. Paul has very well cost. Our other mills, two of them are very driven towards market niches, where they have good costs with competitive advantage. So, I think they are fine.", "I think our URB mills in Cincinnati and Chattanooga since they have remained good earning assets and what I think is a pretty troubled environment and that business are probably very low cost. The Solvay mill, which we are acquiring, we've done a lot of work on the cost structure of that mill and the reason we have identified that acquisition it is just where we want to go in our markets with the lowest cost assets that you can apply to the business.", "And, I think, people recognized that the Solvay is extremely low cost and the box plant system that Southern Container has is extremely well capitalized and very low cost. So, yes, I'm of the view this will bring superior assets to our markets.", "Kevin Casey - Casey Capital", "And, do you also think you are getting more competitive everyday with the cost initiatives?", "James Rubright", "Yes. The Battle Creek mill expansion that we did, we did last September, for example. We took the mill down and we said we're going to take a little pay in quarter, as a result of that it has created capacity at the very high end of our expectations with very low capital costs, which has significantly reduced the operating cost for that mill, which is one example.", "But, I can go through with you many of the things that we think have improved the cost structure of Rock-Tenn. Other people are doing similar things; we're not the only person out there taking costs out. We are on a treadmill that's running pretty fast. But, are we responding? I think yes, and I think we start with bringing a very good asset base to the marketplace.", "Kevin Casey - Casey Capital", "All right, it sounds great, thanks. Congratulations.", "James Rubright", "Thank you, Kevin.", "Operator", "At this time, we show no further questions.", "Steven Voorhees", "Thank you, operator.

Welcome to MeadWestvaco's Fourth Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call. At this point and during management's prepared remarks, we do have all your phone lines in a listen-only mode. However, later there will be opportunities for your questions. [Operator Instructions].", "So with that being said, let's go right to the fourth quarter agenda. Here with our opening remarks is MeadWestvaco's Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Jason Thompson. Good morning, sir, and please go ahead.", "Jason Thompson - Director, Investor Relations", "Thanks, Brent. Good morning, everyone. This morning we announced our results before the market opened. The notification of this morning\u2019s call was broadly disclosed. Further, this morning's call is being webcast at meadwestvaco.com and slides that accompany this call are available there as well.", "I'll briefly remind you that certain statements we make may be forward-looking and are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties described in our public filings. Furthermore, contents contain time-sensitive information that although correct today, may change with the passage of time.", "First a brief recap of the results we reported this morning. For the fourth quarter, we reported a net income of $148 million or $0.82 per share. Included in the results are after-tax restructuring and one-time cost of $29 million or $0.16 per share and an after-tax gain of $102 million or $0.56 per share from the forestland sales.", "Now, here to tell you more about our results for the fourth quarter and full-year are John Luke, Chairman and CEO; Jim Buzzard, our President; and Mark Rajkowski, our CFO.", "I will now turn the call over to John.", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Jason, thanks very much and good morning. MeadWestvaco delivered another year of sales, earnings, and cash flow growth in 2007. Our continuing progress demonstrates that our global packaging platform is delivering value for our customers and is helping to generate higher returns for shareholders.", "At the beginning of last year, we made several commitments to our shareholders and we fulfilled them. We said we would focus on profitable growth and deliver another year of improved earnings. The result, sales in 2007 grew by 6%, including market share gains in some key categories, and profit from our business segments increased by $38 million or 7%. We said we would improve our working capital\u2019s performance and reduce our cost structure. The result, cash flow from operations increased to more than $630 million and we continue to improve our G&A performance.", "We said we would develop a sustainable business for our valuable forestland holdings and return value to our shareholders. The result, we announced the formation of our Community Development and Land Management Group and completed phase one of our ongoing strategy by auctioning nearly 400,000 acres of forestlands and returning $400 million of proceeds to shareholders in the form of a share buyback.", "We said we would have a relentless focus on execution across our company. The result, we operated well, given many challenges in our businesses and in the broader economy including a steep rise in input costs. In addition to these commitments, we made important promises to our customers and backed them up with actions that enhanced our ability to solve their packaging challenges, serve their needs in key growth markets around the world, and help to shape their brand images for consumers.", "We also took a number of decisive strategic actions this year to continue to build a packaging platform that differentiates MeadWestvaco in a global marketplace and deliver long-term value for shareholders. For instance, we opened a new world class packaging facility in Wuxi, China. As this plant ramps up, demand continues to build from customers who are positioning themselves for growth in the Chinese marketplace and across Asia. We acquired Keltec Dispensing Systems and Hayes Products to augment our primary packaging offerings. The integration of these bolt-on acquisitions has been smooth, and their innovative solutions have helped to enhance our relationships with key personal care and home and garden customers. And we signed an agreement with Klabin, Brazil's large paperboard manufacturer, to enhance our industry-leading paperboard line-up. This long-term commercial and marketing partnership with one of Brazil's leading companies gives us an even stronger platform for additional growth in both new and existing global markets. We also signed agreements to license our Natralock security packaging technology, continued to build our growing healthcare adherence packaging business, and doubled our tobacco packaging business in China.", "Overall, our revenue growth in emerging markets this year is nearly 15%, and we generated 50% of our packaging revenue from outside of North America. With these strategic actions, we have made significant progress shaping a strong, innovation-based global packaging platform that enables us to compete and win in our targeted markets, managing well in an uncertain economic environment. This is the essence of our profitable growth strategy, one that builds upon our already strong and diverse market positions by focusing on targeted growth through innovation and expansion in emerging markets and through increased productivity. As we continue to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace and build brand value for our customers, we are enhancing MeadWestvaco's ability to deliver higher returns and long-term value for our shareholders. Even in the face of some economic uncertainty, this strategic focus gives us confidence that we can continue to make meaningful progress along the course we have chartered for profitable growth in our business.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to Jim Buzzard to discuss our operational highlights for the packaging platform and our other businesses during the fourth quarter. Jim?", "James A. Buzzard - President", "Thank you, John. John underscored our solid performance as a company during the year, and I'm pleased to say that it was largely a result of our actions to build a packaging platform and our focus on execution. We did well to deliver improved profitability and significantly higher cash flow in a challenging environment of rising costs, and more recently an uncertain economic outlook.", "The Packaging Resources Group made the largest contribution to our 7% increase in business segment profitability this year, and the Consumer & Office Products segment also delivered solid improvement in an intensely competitive market. On the other hand, our Consumer Solutions and Specialty Chemicals segments did not perform to our expectations.", "The fourth quarter story largely mirrors the story for the entire year. Again, the Packaging Resources Group delivered solid profit improvement. However, lower results in our Consumer Packaging business and Specialty Chemicals contributed to an overall $6 million decline in profitability for our business segments compared to last year. Let me discuss these results for the fourth quarter in more detail as well as some of the ways we are applying our profitable growth strategy for each of our businesses. As usual, you'll find detailed information for all of our business segments in the slide presentation that accompanies this call.", "The Packaging Resources segment delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of strong profit growth, capping an outstanding year in which this segment improved profitability by $47 million. Segment profit margins also improved to 10.7% in 2007, a major accomplishment considering the input cost environment facing this business. During the fourth quarter, segment profit increased by 19% compared to the prior year. We drove improvement to the bottom line through pricing actions, productivity improvements, and enhanced product mix, which together more than outfaced historically high input costs.", "In general, we have been actively managing our paperboard grades to ensure the production and shipments align with most profitable opportunities. This focus on increasing market share for high value grades resulted in slightly lower overall volumes during both the quarter and the full year. During the year, we doubled our volume in China of high-value tobacco packaging by owning market share for premium brands, and we continued to grow share for Coated Natural Kraft in general packaging markets. And entering 2008, backlogs are steady for this time of year. Rigesa, our Brazilian business continues to deliver strong performance. Excellent volume growth driven by strong local markets and improved pricing in the second half of the year contributed to a full year of very positive results.", "In our Consumer Solutions segment, we recorded key commercial successes during the quarter, including share gains in some markets we have targeted for global growth, including beverage, healthcare, and personal care. We also further improved our competitive position with the gross investments to expand both our packaging capabilities and our global footprints, including the Wuxi facility and the acquisition of Keltec and Hayes. However, an overall increase in segment sales this quarter did not translate into better profitability.", "Much of the fourth quarter decline in the profitability of our Consumer Packaging business was due to steep rises in input costs and competitive pressure in our media business. About one-third of our annual input cost increases hit during the fourth quarter, including increases for critical raw materials such as resin, steel and paperboard. We are benefiting from contractual escalators, but our pricing still lags behind continued steep rises in input costs. We will respond to rising input costs through additional pricing actions and productivity initiatives. This includes measures that will lower our cost base, improve our supply chain, and deliver efficiencies throughout the organization. In addition, earnings were impacted by some one-time costs for Wuxi, Keltec, and Hayes. These one-time costs are behind us and the investments that we have made along with our commercial momentum and disciplined pricing actions will contribute to a rebound in margins in 2008.", "Taking a closer look at each of our markets in Consumer Solutions, demand remained solid in our beverage business. We had good growth during the fourth quarter as markets remained strong in Europe and we picked up new business in Asia. We met the strong customer demand by rebalancing our supply chain, which maximized our cash position, but had a negative impact on profitability during the quarter. Moving forward, we expect to improve profitability in our beverage business by accelerating growth in emerging markets and further leveraging new product initiatives. For instance, we continued to make share gains with our Coated Natural Kraft solution as an alternative to corrugated packaging. Global beverage customers such as Anheuser-Busch and Fosters value the operational efficiencies and printability of our solution for glass bottle packaging. Despite a tremendous effort over the past year to optimize and stabilize our media business by reducing costs and regaining shares of specialty packaging, profitability was still lower because of competitive pricing pressure in the marketplace.", "Traditional printed packaging for music still in decline, but we gained share in specialty DVD titles and video game releases. We've built valuable partnerships with some of the largest film and gaming companies in the industry. As an example, our designers now work onsite with EA Sports in an arrangement to deliver significant savings and enhance long-term collaboration. But there are still intense cost and price pressures in this business. As such, we will have to continue to win share with new products and distinctive design capabilities along with ongoing productivity actions to drive profit improvement in our global media business.", "We serve the healthcare and personal care markets with both our visual packaging and folding cartons solutions, as well as dispensing and sprayer technologies. Fourth Quarter sales in our healthcare business were up double digits compared to last year and we expect this momentum to continue in 2008, especially as we drive revenue through our shell pack supply agreement for Wal-Mart's Prescription Drug Program and as we continue to increase sales of our pharmaceutical pumps for over-the-counter cold medicines.", "Personal care is another market we have targeted for growth around the world, including our solutions for cosmetics, hair coloring, fragrances and lotions. We are winning new business with customers such as Procter & Gamble, and we've seen strong sales increases for high value fragrance pumps in Europe. In addition, we've added capacity to serve Chinese markets from our Wuxi facility, and we augmented our product line with Keltec's airless and foaming technologies. We're are just beginning to gain traction from these investments, and we expect further progress as we move through 2008.", "In Consumer Solutions, we can clearly do better. Our existing market positions remain strong and we are gaining share by delivering innovative and distinctive packaging solutions for our customers. This year, we expect to build on this momentum in the marketplace and significantly grow our topline by capitalizing on opportunities to leverage our investments in expanded global packaging capabilities in beverage, healthcare, and personal care markets. Specifically, we will look for growth from Keltec's innovative product line as well as Natralock, shell pack, and Calmar solutions for the personal care and healthcare markets. In addition, we have productivity plans in place that will ensure that we capture more of that growth through a competitive overall cost base, including manufacturing, supply chain, and sourcing initiatives as well as G&A reductions. We are still going to see rising input costs overall and some pricing pressure in the media business. But we are confident that we can overcome these challenges with our growth and productivity plans for the Consumer Solutions business.", "Turning to our non-packaging businesses, results for the Consumer & Office Products segment were flat during the fourth quarter, but they recorded a strong year of profit growth in a very difficult marketplace. The environment for Consumer & Office products is challenging with retailers reporting slower customer traffic and weaker sales late in 2007. However, we are performing well by continuing to focus on innovative, brand name, proprietary products, and by executing with our retail partners. In addition, our Brazilian business is growing nicely with a strong product line that is selling well to the consumers, and we look for good sell through to consumers in the next two weeks. As a result, profits in the Consumer & Office segment were up 9% for the entire.", "The fourth quarter results for Specialty Chemicals were similar to what we've been talking about all year. We delivered pricing and product mix improvements that significantly outpaced cost inflation, even with many raw material prices hitting record highs during the quarter. And while sluggish U.S. auto and housing markets continued to have an impact on sales, we are winning some share in paper chemicals and seeing opportunities to grow our carbon business in non-automotive markets.", "Overall, profitability for Specialty Chemicals was down for both the fourth quarter and for the full year. However, we feel good about the trajectory of our operational performance and expect to deliver earnings improvement in the first quarter and beyond. Overall, we have substantial opportunities for profitable growth in our global packaging platform and other businesses. We will achieve our goals by executing on our strategy to deliver innovative products to the marketplace through our business in key end markets and emerging economies and increased productivity to help fund our plans for global growth.", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss some of our financial metrics for the fourth quarter. Mark?", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Jim. In 2007, we delivered improved results for shareholders and executed on strategic initiatives that enhanced our competitive position in the global packaging marketplace. In addition to generating better earnings, we returned value directly to shareholders through our strong dividend and substantial share repurchases.", "Adjusted earnings per share for 2007 grew 9% to $1.09 per share, which excludes restructuring and one-time items and the large forestland gains. As important, our cash from operations was excellent. At over $630 million for the full year, cash flow from operations showed solid improvement from last year's level of $567 million. We improved our cash performance by delivering better earnings and reducing working capital by almost five days or 7%.", "Now, turning to the income statement for the fourth quarter, I will highlight a few key items. Our topline grew at 4% versus the prior year. All of the business segments except Consumer & Office Products, showed increased sales year-over-year, primarily due to price in mix gains and positive foreign exchange. While volumes were slightly lower across all business units, the main volume impact in the quarter was driven by our decision to de-emphasize some commodity paperboard grades in favor of more profitable business and by our ongoing emphasis on proprietary branded products in the Consumer & Office Products business.", "Our gross margin in the fourth quarter, adjusted for restructuring charges, was $334 million or 18% of sales, which is 130-basis point decline compared to the year ago quarter. This decline was the result of $40 million of higher input costs across all of our business units, costs associated with starting up our two new lines in Wuxi, China, as well as higher costs primarily associated with reduced manufacturing overhead absorption. Late in the quarter, in response to a slowing U.S. economy, we began to slow production to minimize inventory levels heading into 2008. Partially offsetting these negative impacts were price and mix improvements, primarily in our paperboard products, as well as positive foreign exchange. As you've no doubt heard and read, we are pursuing additional price increases to offset cost inflation, which we expect will continue to be a significant headwind in 2008.", "Our SG&A progress continued during the quarter. Adjusted to exclude about $11 million in restructuring and one-time cost, SG&A in the most recent quarter was about $215 million or 11.6% of sales, down 50 basis points from last year. Cost reductions we enacted as part of our G&A transformation more than offset the increases due to acquisitions, inflation, growth investments, and higher foreign exchange.", "We had good momentum in the fourth quarter on our cost initiatives, achieving an additional $29 million in run rate savings in bringing our cumulative savings from this program to $190 million. These cost savings are the result of our efforts to continue to expand the scope of our global shared services business model, reduced redundant infrastructure costs in our businesses and corporate departments, and from the additional consolidation of warehouses in our distribution network. With these actions and others, we have eliminated 165 positions in the fourth quarter, bringing the total to about 1200 position since the start of this program.", "While we made good progress on G&A cost in the fourth quarter, we know that we've much more to do to achieve our target of 10% SG&A as a percentage of sales. While we will continuing to invest in and grow our topline, we will also continue to reduce G&A cost by implementing our shared services model in Europe and Asia, and continuing to consolidate redundant infrastructure and supply chain cost.", "Fourth quarter adjusted earnings before interest and taxes were $134 million, a 7% decline compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. Improved performance in the mill business was more than offset by declines in the Consumer Packaging and Specialty Chemicals businesses. We also had approximately $4 million of lower small-track land sales in the fourth quarter versus last year.", "Before turning to the outlook, I want to briefly review the highlights of the forestland transactions. In the fourth quarter, we completed the sale of 323,000 acres of owned and leased forest lands bringing the total gross proceeds from our timberland sales to $493 million in 2007. I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the people who worked directly on these transactions. That team did a tremendous job of executing these deals, monetizing the proceeds in a very timely and tax efficient manner in what can only be described as an extremely challenging capital markets' environment.", "With net proceeds of $400 million, we executed an accelerated share repurchase agreement in the fourth quarter, delivering on our promise to return all of the forestland proceeds to shareholders. Through the end of 2007, we received and retired 11 million shares or 6% of our total shares outstanding. By the second half of 2008, we'll see the full benefit of this collared repurchase program under which there's a potential for a total of 14 million shares to be returned and retired.", "Now, I'll provide our perspectives on the year ahead and a more detailed look at the first quarter. Entering 2008, the U.S. economic landscape is unclear and we've little visibility beyond the first quarter. However, we do have good confidence in our ability to continue to improve our competitive position in our global packaging markets through this uncertain economic environment as we leverage the investments we've made this year to strengthen our global packaging platform. The acquisitions of Keltec and Hayes and the startup our new operations at Wuxi augment our already strong packaging capabilities and presence outside the U.S., and we also have new products to introduce in some of our targeted markets that will help drive growth and margin improvement. Finally, we are committed to delivering ongoing annual productivity improvement of at least 3% per year.", "Now, turning to the first quarter. As many of you know, it is our seasonally weakest quarter and we typically post a breakeven performance. Starting with the mills, backlogs are seasonally solid. We're also continuing to pursue price increases to offset the ongoing negative effects of inflation. However, with a $10 million to $15 million negative impact of scheduled maintenance downtime at our Mahrt and Evadale mills during the first quarter, we expect overall segment profitability to be about even with year-ago levels.", "In the Consumer Packaging segment, we are expecting segment profit to improve quarter sequentially, but be flattish compared to year-ago levels. We are monitoring the impact of the slowing U.S. economy on our lines of business. However, we do expect volume growth outside the U.S. where market demand has been strong, particularly for personal care and healthcare packaging solutions. In addition, the ramp-up costs for Wuxi and Keltec are largely behind us, and we are expecting to begin recouping raw material costs including resin and steel through contractual price increases.", "In the Consumer & Office Products segment, we expect segment profit to be slightly above year-ago levels. We expect improvements from a strong back-to-school season in Brazil as well as a continued shift of sales from time management products into the first quarter.", "For the Specialty Chemicals segment, we expect strong year-over-year improvement. Pricing and productivity improvements will more than offset lower volumes from the weak automotive and housing sectors.", "With that, I will turn it back to John.", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Mark, thanks very much. As we delivered on our commitments to shareholders in 2007, we strengthened the financial position of our company and continued to build a competitive global packaging platform with the right capabilities to serve our customers wherever they do business around the world. As economic uncertainty continues to mount, we believe that the strategy we are pursuing including enhancements to our global business mix will position us well for profitable growth in 2008 and beyond.", "Now, we will be happy to address whatever questions you may have. Brent, back to you.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "Indeed, well thank you very much Mr. Luke and our host panel for that update. We do appreciate that. [Operator Instructions]. Representing JPMorgan, our first question, we go to the line of Claudia Hueston. Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "Thanks very much, good morning.", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Claudia.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "Just a couple of questions on the Consumer Solutions Group. First, I was just hoping that you could quantify the impact of a startup and one-time costs that you referenced at Wuxi and Keltec?", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, Claudia. The combined impact of both of those was roughly $5 million to $6 million.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "And they pretty much go away then in the first quarter?", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, for the most part. Some of that was purchase accounting and some of it was just the first startup of our manufacturing facility in Wuxi.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then just thinking about sort of margins going forward I guess sort of two questions; one, just how much of the business is on escalators and sort of what are the terms of those pricing escalators with regard to raw materials? And then I think you've talk before about sort of wanting to get like a 5% kind of margin level as sort of your stage one recovery in that business. How should we think about that time frame in terms of getting there as we look to 2008?", "Jason Thompson - Director, Investor Relations", "Mark or John will take that.", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Or James.", "James A. Buzzard - President", "I will address the first one, Claudia, in terms of the escalators of price increases and turn it to Mark on the second half. In the Consumer Solutions business, most... all of our contracts around Calmar have resin escalators in them and there is obviously a lag, so we get the price increase. We are now out implementing those price increases as we speak. We are also looking for more than what those escalators called for to make up for the steel increases as well that we've seen in those product categories.", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, as far as the margin improvement, Claudia, you are absolutely right. We are still targeting that 5% as the first step. We will see margins improve quite sequentially in this first quarter and certainly we expect to be at that 5% level as we get towards the second half of 2008.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "Thanks. That's really helpful. And then just finally on the tax rate, it\u2019d moved around a lot in 2007. How should we think about it for 2008?", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "2008 we are thinking to be somewhere around 30%... 28% to 30%.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Jason Thompson - Director, Investor Relations", "Thanks, Claudia.", "Operator", "And thank you very much. Next representing UBS we go the line of Gail Glazerman. Please go ahead.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Hi, thank you. Just staying on the Consumer Solution business for a minute, it was obviously a huge swing from your forecast. You talked about the different issues. I am just wondering if you could say what your biggest surprise was? Was it the $5 million to $6 million in startup cost relative to your outlook last quarter or was it the inflation?", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, let me start off. I think, previous... probably one of the biggest parts of that was input cost. We thought it would be higher\u2026 it was even higher than we expected. The other part is we did\u2026 as we looked out into 2008 we wanted to make sure we cleaned our inventories as much as we could, particularly in our beverage business. We sold a lot out of inventory and we took some downtime in our converging facilities and that also impacted our profitability. So those were probably two of the biggest effects. We also saw a little bit more softness in the home and garden market, particularly around one of our largest customers that we expected to see a little bit more of a bounce-back and it just didn't happen.", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you. If I could just punctuate a point that both Mark and Jim have made, I think the input cost question given the inflationary pressures we are seeing here and across the board are substantial and even where we do have opportunities for immediate pass-through of these costs, there is an inherent lag effect associated with that. In some cases there is negotiation, but even where we have a contractual agreement to pass it right on through, there is just a bit of a lag. And so I think as you look at all of that understanding that we are restless with... and we are driving across the board to ensure we pass these increase through ever where we don't have immediate pass-through right, but there is inherently a lag associated with that.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Okay. And I guess staying on that business, it looks like we are starting this year winner in the HD, like DVD versus BluRay battle. At this point do you think it's just too late to make a difference or are you seeing any signs of that in your orders?", "James A. Buzzard - President", "Gail, this is Jim. I think clearly we are well positioned with BluRay with the package of choice with them. So we are obviously very excited about that. We think that there will be growth as result of that, but it's still pretty early in the process and so I think we will see that\u2026 as we go to 2008, we will see some positive benefit, but it's awful early right now.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Okay, and just one final question. In terms of Consumer & Office, you\u2019ve had a lots of pressure from imports over the last few years. I am just wondering if you are seeing any changes in the market, for instance, I think the Chinese markets are starting to tighten up a little bit, are you seeing any of that flowing into your business?", "James A. Buzzard - President", "It's a little early for us to see that here. We'll get that in our back-to-school business is when we will really get a clear indication of that and that's probably early Q1, early Q2. But I think to your point we've seen pressures over the years in the commodity part of the business. The branded proprietary products continue to do very well in the marketplace and we\u2019ve invested in those, but we are seeing and hearing of some cost increases coming out of China and we think that will... that may benefit us going forward.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And thank you very much. Next, representing Buckingham Research we\u2019ll go to the line of Mark Weintraub. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Thank you. Now that you\u2019ve had Calmar under your belt for a full calendar year, can you share with us how that performed relative to your expectations and where that's going at this juncture?", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Mark, let me start it off and then Jim can add any points I've missed. But I think... fourth quarter, obviously there... we made some investments in\u2026 for Keltec and in Wuxi that had an impact on our profitability, high raw material cost, but as we look at the fundamentals of this business going forward, we continue to be very bullish. That business grew in the fourth quarter 12% year-over-year on the topline. We have made investments to continue to grow in some key end-markets like personal care. And we've also taken some share in a couple of key markets including fragrance. And in the fourth quarter, our fragrance business was up 17% year-over-year, our pharma business was up 40%. So we feel very good about the fundamentals and really the reason we acquired Calmar, which was to drive growth in our Packaging business at very good margins.", "James A. Buzzard - President", "Maybe just building on that a little bit, as Mark said we like the markets, we like the opportunity to create unique and distinctive products, and that's really what is fueling the growth that we are seeing. We're very excited about the new product pipeline that exist today, and things we\u2019ll be rolling out in 2008, and the addition of Keltec and Hayes gives us new technologies to enter adjacent markets as well. So in many respects, as Mark said, a tough year, but the fundamentals of the business and fundamentals of the markets keep us very excited about the opportunities for this business going forward.", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. And Mark, it's John. I might just add briefly to what Mark and Jim have said and say that strategically this business remains spot on in terms of our commitment, our sense of the opportunities here. Quarter does not in any way make a trend and we understand what drove some of the issues in that business, but as we look out at the global opportunities, as we look at the opportunities we see not only here, but the opportunities for [inaudible] for growth in the personal care and healthcare markets around the world, and we look at the quality of the underlying team leading Calmar, we're very bullish on the future.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Were the biggest issues just that you have the import cost pressure and that there is a lag in your ability to get that through to pricing for the Calmar business specifically or were there other things as well that have to be rectified?", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "That's the principal issue that has impacted results, Mark.", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That was the biggest issue, and we ramped-up Wuxi in the fourth quarter as well.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "And so, do you have visibility on getting that pricing that will offset the input cost, or is that something that is a give-and-take battle and you hope to get there, but you don't really have visibility on it?", "James A. Buzzard - President", "We've got\u2026 Mark, we've got good visibility on it. We track it account by account. We talk about it on a very regular basis, and we're out in the marketplace pushing that right now and we feel confident that we will see increased pricing as a result.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Two other quick questions, one, East Edisto, I know you'd hoped to originally have the plan in place by year-end. Obviously, conditions have been difficult and there is always process involved. Where does that stand right now?", "And second, just in curiosity, when you say that you had 11 million shares have been... I can't remember the specific language you used, but have they actually been purchased in the marketplace by\u2026 I guess it is Goldman who's doing the buying for you, have those shares actually been purchased from the marketplace yet?", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Mark, let me answer the first and then I'll turn it to Mark Rajkowski for the share purchase question. I think the East Edisto progress continues to be good. We're working hard to develop the preliminary master plan and putting the finishing touching on that. Lag maybe the operative word of the day. We've got roughly about a quarter lag in terms of the timing. We would expect to have the next round of public presentations on that later this winter and no later than the early part of the spring. Mark?", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, and as far as the stock buyback to this accelerated share repurchase program, what happens is we go out with the bank and they borrow the shares and then take them out of the market, but then buy\u2026 physically buy shares over the next number of months, which will probably take us through May or June of 2008. And we've got this transaction collared. We have an immediate 11 million shares that are in essence off our books for accounting purposes. And we expect that as we close out this program that the full benefit could be up to 14 million shares.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "So have those 11 million shares has been physically repurchased at this point or not necessarily?", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "They are in the process of being repurchased.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And next we\u2019ll go to the line of George Staphos representing Banc of America. Please go ahead.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "Thanks. Hi, everyone. Good morning.", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, George.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "The first question I had just with tax resources going from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, you'd mentioned I think $10 million to $15 million of downtime with an EBIT of negative variance sequentially. Are there any other factors that you mentioned and can quantify, that take us from 4Q to 1Q as you see it?", "James A. Buzzard - President", "George, no. It is related to a maintenance outrage that we did not take last year in the first quarter, but we'll take this year in the first quarter, and that comprises the number that Mark referenced in terms of our holding of price, volumes, other thing we feel very good about the business as we go forward.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "Yes. Well, I guess the question I have, if you did about 80 million this quarter, and last quarter if I'm not mistaken you did about\u2026 last year's first quarter you did about 55 million, we\u2019d accounted for about half of that drop off. What else is there? Is it just seasonal volume, although I thought that would be incorporated in the downtime? Is there anything else that could be a driver of the variance in the EBIT?", "James A. Buzzard - President", "No. I think Mark's reference was Q1 of last year to Q1 of this year in terms of the $15 million variance. Normally, the first quarter tends to be a little bit slower for us and we would expect to see that this year. But fundamentally, nothing different from year-on-year comparisons to quarter one.", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, George. And I guess I would just punctuate the fact by saying that here and around the world the business tone is positive and the pricing trends are positive as well.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "Okay, I appreciate that. If we go back to consumer solutions, are there any points in your key attributes for the businesses that you aspire to that you think you are may be behind the curve on? Said differently, how would you rate Consumer Solutions total on R&D design, [inaudible] average on commercializing the technology? How do you think you stand relative to some of your peers within the Specialty Packaging industry [inaudible] as you have?", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "George, it's John. Let me offer the following comments. I think we are very bullish on the opportunities we see, particularly in the targeted areas of personal care and healthcare. As we look at ourselves and understand what has influenced our performance both on the primary and on the secondary packing side during the past few months, notably in the fourth quarter, stripping all of that away, I think that while we've made progress we had not made as much progress in those segments I referenced, most notably personal care and healthcare, and we have not leveraged the design and innovation potential that we have in our pipeline successfully as we might. That said, those are always areas that in this business one has to do better and better to achieve the levels of performance that really winning is all about and that's going to be the area of concerted focus in this organization as we move through the coming 12 months.", "George Staphos - Bank of America", "Okay. Do you think the value that you provide for the terms of pricing, whether contractual or just your general business within those specific segments of businesses, is similar to what again your competition sees and provides to the market or do you think that you maybe somewhat at a disadvantage at this juncture either on contracts or some other way that you go about going to market?", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "It's hard to get total visibility in all of those issues, George. Let me answer it this way. I think value that we bring and certainly are capable of bringing if we leverage our design and innovation platform as rigorously as we might gives us an opportunity to improve that value equation, given what we will be bringing to the customers. And consistent with our drive to leverage more innovation is the desire to... the imperative to get paid requisite value for that pricing structure.", "George Staphos - Bank of America", "I mean the reason I obviously asked the question is, of the other Specialty Packaging companies that I cover, they all have gone through input cost pressures, they are all in various stages of expanding their business from time to time and candidly I don't have one that is at a 2% margin or 5% margin for that matter at the present time. So I would argue that either there are some issues that you are working through on the marketing side and contract side or there are some issues more structurally within your business, either there is some piece of your portfolio that perhaps shouldn't be there given the other strength that you have. How do you see it at this juncture?", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, let me answer at this way. I think you\u2019ve hit on some key issues, which reinforced us as we look at ourselves and look at what others are doing in other parts of the Specialty Packaging business. There is upside that we are not adequately leveraging by doing all of the innovation work that we can. If we look at things that have influenced the margin, again I will go back as well and point to a couple of the other key issues that are influencing thing, one, media as Mark mentioned and Jim mentioned, a significant portion of that overall equation is what we have seen during the year even though revenues come along [inaudible], revenues relative to historic norms has not been as attractive and there has been margin squeeze there, which has taken the overall down. And then you layer in some of the issues that we've talked about, most particularly influencing Calmar [inaudible] impact as well. I think that the fundamental though is building a higher quality position premise on innovation and in the healthcare and personal care markets that we've targeted and leveraging the growth that exist and is reinforced even in the most recent year-end results published by important customers like Est\u00e9e Lauder, Procter & Gamble and others. Their international growth potential is what they site as the most significant and we've got to be right there with them.", "James A. Buzzard - President", "And George, I'd also say that we're not happy with our\u2026 certainly where our operating margins are today. As we move through this past year up through the third quarter, we had made steady improvement heading little bit north of 4% in the third quarter. We took some hits in Q4, whether it was high raw materials, but also some investments we made in Wuxi, in Keltec, and I think what we feel very good about is that those investments that we did take a hit for in the fourth quarter position us very well for the type of profitable growth that we see to get us to that 5% and beyond in terms of our operating margins.", "George Staphos - Bank of America", "Okay. I appreciate that. We will pick it up with some other point, but good luck in the quarter guys.", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, George.", "Operator", "And thank you very much, Mr. Staphos. Next in queue we've got up a line of Chip Dillon with Citigroup. Please go ahead sir.", "Chip Dillon - Citigroup", "Yes, good morning. Just a couple of house keeping things, where did your share count at the end of the year and where do you see CapEx being in 2008?", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "In terms of our share count\u2026 I'll get one of the guys to get the exact number, but in terms of CapEx, we directionally are going to be spending lower in 2008 versus 2007. And we'll get back to you with the exact share count in just a second here.", "Chip Dillon - Citigroup", "Okay. And as you're getting that, when I look at the consumer solution slide, slide 26, it\u2019s hard to see in there the startup costs. Maybe you could help us, where would that part be? We can see volume and price and I guess the cost, but I don't see necessary an usually or separated number for the startup costs at Keltec and Wuxi. Can you give us some idea as to what kind of that\u2026 how much that was and\u2026 or at least what would be considered unusual?", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. It\u2019s roughly $6 million.", "Chip Dillon - Citigroup", "Okay, got you. And then, as you look at 2008 and you look at the... I guess the beverage carrier market, what do you see for that? I mean are you tapped out\u2026 I believe the Mahrt Mill is tapped out, but you still have the ability to convert more or sell two converters of beverage carriers. Is that right, in other words you can upgrade your mix there a little bit in terms of converting?", "James A. Buzzard - President", "Chip, that's right, we can. We see some\u2026 we see growth opportunities. I referenced the replacement of some corrugated packaging with CNK based packaging and we see continued opportunities there. And at Mahrt, we are obviously selling everything we produce there, but my expectation is that the team down there will produce more in 2008 than they did in 2007.", "Chip Dillon - Citigroup", "Okay. And then the last question is, I've taken some numbers from the slides and from the... in particular, the one that gives a breakdown of where corporate expense is going, and it seems like to sort of make the other income line that's on the main income statement foot that you have a pretty large other income. Now, I know you do break out, that interest did go up a nice amount, $5 million from the third to the fourth, but\u2026 and maybe you could... I\u2019ve just two questions. Is $9 million for quarter or anything closer that sustainable, number one, I guess not with rates coming down. And number two, were there other things in that sort of other line that would have accounted for that increase?", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Chip, it's Mark. I think part of that was we had some interest on the... our installment note that accounts for part of that increase. But when you cut through it all, as we look our corporate another line, we still believe that on a run rate basis we're in that $50 million range.", "Chip Dillon - Citigroup", "And do you see a material change in the pension income number for next year?", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No. It's within $1 million or $2 million. We'll be adjusting our assumptions around our discount rate, but that shouldn't have a material impact on pension income.", "Chip Dillon - Citigroup", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And next we go to the line of Mark Wilde representing Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Good morning.", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Mark.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "I wanted to just go back to Consumer Solutions and just follow-up on a comment that you made in your commentary. You mentioned that I think throttling back on production a bit late in the fourth quarter as you saw some signs of a slowdown in the U.S. Can you talk about that a little bit further, what exactly you are seeing and sort of how you bake that into your outlook for '08?", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So let me start off, Mark. Really, I think what we were concerned about was that given the levels of inventory that we had as we entered the fourth quarter and at least signals that we had been seeing relative to volumes and demand, we felt that it was important that instead of continuing to run production at 100% that we really needed to work down those inventory. So we took some shutdowns, and we think that as we head into 2008, we\u2019ve got our inventory levels roughly in line with what market demand is going to be.", "James A. Buzzard - President", "Mark, this is Jim. A big part of that actually was in Europe. And as we all recall very warm weather in Europe this year, so our beverage customers really came in with heavy orders. Final sell through wasn't as strong and so part of that was correcting for that imbalance in the fourth quarter. So sold it through, got back to normal levels of inventory as Mark said, but it was more of a seasonal issue than anything else.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Did you\u2026 actually, Jim, in the businesses domestically or offshore, did you see any signs of an economy slowing down and kind of rippling through the year businesses?", "James A. Buzzard - President", "No. We have not seen any indication of that at this point. As I referenced, our backlogs, our mills are where we would expect them to be this of year and order flows through the other businesses are holding up well.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay. And then, just a kind of\u2026 in Consumer Solutions also just to kind of follow on what George Staphos was mentioning. It seems like since we started on the strategy, which I think all of us understand, in focusing on downstream packaging converting businesses, for the last seven or eight years, it just seems like this has been a pretty bumpy path for the company, and I just wonder about pulling back from kind of more acquisitions activity for a couple of years and really trying to get the margins and the returns up in the business rather than jump even further into the strategy, any thoughts on that?", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Mark, let me offer a few comments here. I think that what you would have just described in the form of a question is very much in keeping with the big influence we have in place. It is all about execution. If you go back to what I was saying in response to George's comments, it is continuing to focus on those areas of opportunity we have targeted for growth, personnel care and health care, and fundamentally limiting our acquisition strategy to one that provides bolt-ons of the sort that we pursued in support of Calmar during 2007, acquisitions that provide unique technologies that enhance the overall capabilities we bring to a marketplace, and that is the area focus. But it is all about execution, it is about innovations, and as with the full measure of our business about insuring is part of that execution that productivity is key.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay, a couple of other questions. Is it possible in the quarter and for the year for you to quantify for us how much FX may have affected your numbers both in terms of topline and then the earnings?", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, Mark. In terms of the quarter, the FX impact was around 3% or 4% and the dollar impact in terms of FX was slightly north of $10 million.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "And any earnings impact, Mark?", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That was the earnings impact, a little bit north of $10 million.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay. All right.", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And the topline was 3%.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay, all right. And how much impact specifically in the Consumer & Office business, because a lot of that business I think is down in Brazil with Tilibra now?", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It was relatively modest, it was a few million dollars, two maybe. Not much.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay. Last question I had really I guess for Jim Buzzard. It just seems, Jim, that we are not getting quite as much earnings leverage out of the mills as I would have expected, given kind of the strength in virtually all of the paper board markets, whether it's the SBS market or the containerboard market, which you have in Brazil and down at Charlestown or CNK market, any thoughts?", "James A. Buzzard - President", "Mark, I think that we had\u2026 as I referenced we had a good year. I think we were pleased with the improvements we saw year-over-year in the business. As I referenced in my comments our volumes were down, but we did that intentionally. We are making a concerted effort to improve the product mix out of those operations, and so we have backed off in some of the heavier weight commoditized grades and are filling back with other more profitable grades. So we continue to expect the business to improve year-on-year and we continue to expect that the high inflationary pressures that we have been feeling will continue to offset those price increases as well.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Would you anticipate that we see incrementally volume gains year-on-year in \u201908, Jim, out of the mills?", "James A. Buzzard - President", "That would my expectation, yes.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Any idea how big?", "James A. Buzzard - President", "Not at this point, no.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay, all right. Thanks a lot, guys.", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Mark.", "Operator", "And thank you very much, Mr. Wilde. Representing Lehman Brothers let's go to the line of Peter Ruschmeier now. Please go ahead.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Thanks, good morning.", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Pete.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Couple of questions, I was curious, maybe from Mark, if you have enough an update on your over-funded pension balance at the end of the year, or just directionally did it go up or down?", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It went up by over $200 million. So we are very well over-funded.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, any comments on your plan asset performance last year?", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It was excellent and it was in the... around the low to mid-teens.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Well, that's good. Okay, thanks. Another question, I guess on the balance sheet, I'm curious of your... if you look at your working capital, it seems like a dollar amount, it is just a fairly high number. I'm curious if you have ever thought about securitizing, freeing up some of the working capital, and how you think about that?", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, we agree with you, Peter. It is high. We\u2019ve made good progress in taking that down. We\u2026 as I said, we improved our cash-to-cash or total working capital by five days or 7% during the course of this past year, but we have more work to do and there is operational improvements we need to make. We have certainly looked at the option around securitization, but in this recent period of rough and tumble credit markets, some of the terms just weren\u2019t all that attractive, but it is something that we look at and we\u2019ll continue to look at as a potential opportunity.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Right, maybe also a financial question if I could on your debt. Can you remind us\u2026 update us on fixed versus floating? I was a little surprised to see the interest expense go up sequentially with net debt trends down.", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, it's roughly 24% floating at this point, and the part of the reason for that tick-up was again this\u2026 the monetization that we did in the installment note and the related debt associated with that timberlands transaction. So that was... most of that pop up in interest expenses.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, and would you expect over time that floating will come back down again and fixed go up?", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We manage that as a function of what our debt to cap is and also the strength of our balance sheet. So that varies from time to time, but right now we are about in our sweet spot. I wouldn't expect it to move too much.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "How about on tax rate, I don't believe you commented, I know it is hard to pin you down a single estimate, but what do you think is reasonable at this point if you\u2019re thinking about for all of '08 in terms of a general tax rate?", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Somewhere between 28% and 30%.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And then lastly, maybe a question for Jim Buzzard, if I could. On bleachboard markets, I'm just curious if you can talk a little bit more about the tones there, the puts and takes in the tobacco markets both positive and negative around the world, it seems like there is something different, movements and different customers, and also on pricing, which has generally been an upward trend. I am curious what percent of your business in the first quarter might be slated to trying to be raise prices on customers at this point?", "James A. Buzzard - President", "Sure, Peter. In terms of the bleachboard markets as I have said, our backlogs are where we would expect them to be. The tone of the markets remains positive in the... you referenced tobacco, clearly we are seeing growth opportunities with the quality of our board in markets like China where we are capturing share. But there is also growth in those markets as well and we are able to take advantage of that. So we continue to feel about the bleachboard market and the end-markets that we serve.", "In terms of price increases, I wouldn't give a percentage of the volume going up, but as you know we have announced price increases in the general folding carton markets for SBS. We are out with the food service and office products as well and the beverage markets and we have some selected increases in other regions of the world on specific end markets also.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And again we were talking $40 a ton in mid Feb?", "James A. Buzzard - President", "Yes, that's right.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And just lastly back on the tobacco, growth in China\u2026 does the growth in China\u2026 is that market large enough to offset every kind of declines in volumes in other markets? In other words, can you comment on your overall tobacco volumes as a company?", "James A. Buzzard - President", "Sure, our tobacco volumes in '07 were up very nicely year-on-year. The China market is a huge market, and what we are seeing in that market and others is really a fundamental shift to higher quality packaging and that goes right into bleachboard and right into our product line. So as these markets continue to develop, the demand for packaging and high-quality packaging continues to go up and it fits right with our... both our bleachboard and our converting operations as well.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Maybe lastly, John, I wanted to ask you a question as well. Is it possible just to... a real high level... what two or three things do you think keeps you up at night the most thinking about MeadWestvaco's opportunities for '08 just from a strategic perspective? I am hearing a lot of details on different businesses, but if you could maybe jell it down to one or two or three items that, John, you really think you need to spend your time on in '08? I am kind of curious on what you think that is.", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Pete, thanks very much. I will go back to some of the themes we have been echoing throughout this call in and around the detail, and I was just leveraging on the point Jim made about tobacco in China, say that in China not only with tobacco product materials but also other products, its growth in emerging markets China, India, other such markets around the world is going to be very, very important for us to continue to focus on. Second, doing so not just with volume, but with... volume represents profitable growth, and doing that as I have commented earlier in the call on where execution in and around the high-potential we have to contribute to our customer's business through elevation and other forms of design, and lastly productivity. We need to be continuing to drive as we grow around the world productivity across the board. Productivity in emerging markets we made important progress during 2007. We did not make the progress in innovation in terms of commercialization of that innovation that we can and must as we move into 2007. So those are three areas that I focus on, that the team focuses on, and I would tell you we are making priority in our communications and actions and plans across the company.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. If you could just comment and I'll turn over... the 3% productivity goals seems like a good one. I think if you could maybe help us to better understand what goes into that and how we measure you on that from quarter-to-quarter I think that'd be very helpful.", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, we will do it.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "And thank you, Mr. Ruschmeier. Well, that does bring us to the top of the hour. So ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Mr. Luke, Mr. Rajkowski, and the team at MeadWestvaco I would like to thank you very much for your interest in today's call.", "And Mr. Luke is also making today's conference available for digitized replay.

My name is Trey, and I will be your conference operator this morning. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Rock-Tenn second quarter 2008 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this call is being recorded today, April 29, 2008. (Operator Instructions).", "Your speakers for today's call are Mr. John Stakel, Vice President and Treasurer; Mr. Steven Voorhees, Chief Financial Officer and Mr. James Rubright, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.", "Mr. Stakel, you may begin your conference.", "John Stakel", "Thank you, Trey. Welcome to Rock-Tenn's fiscal second quarter 2008 conference call. During the course of the conference call we may make statements that are not historical in nature and may involve forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws.", "For example, statements regarding our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events are forward-looking statements which involve a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control and that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed.", "Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties is contained in the documents that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents include the Company's Form 10-K filed for the year ended September 30, 2007 and the Form 10-Q filed for the quarter ended December 31, 2007.", "During the call we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are contained in the second quarter press release, which is available on Rock-Tenn's website at Rock-Tenn.com.", "With that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Steve Voorhees.", "Steve Voorhees", "Thanks, John. During the second fiscal quarter, Rock-Tenn announced, financed and closed the acquisition of Southern Container. Rock-Tenn's second quarter results include 29 days of operating results for the acquisition.", "Southern Container's operating results, including the results of the Solvay containerboard mill are shown in the Corrugated Packaging segment, along with our legacy corrugated operations and also the results of our corrugated medium mill in St. Paul, Minnesota.", "Historical segment results have been reclassified to reflect this alignment. Rock-Tenn's net sales in the March quarter were $685.9 million, an increase of $100 million, up 17% when compared to last year's March quarter.", "Southern Container accounted for $51 million of the increase, or about half of the increase. Rock-Tenn's sales, excluding Southern Container, increased 8% over the same quarter of last year and sequentially increased 6% over the most recent December quarter.", "Rock-Tenn reported second quarter net income of $17 million, or $0.45 per share. We have $0.21 in adjustments, most of which are attributable to the Southern Container acquisition. $0.05 is the cost of the bridge facility that supported the financing commitment we made to the sellers of Southern Container.", "$0.03 is the write-off of the unamortized financing costs on our balance sheet from the credit facility that was in place prior to the acquisition. $0.12 is the impact of the purchase accounting step up in the value of Southern Container's inventory at the time of the acquisition.", "US GAAP requires us to step up the value of the inventory we acquired to a level that in the case of finished goods approximates the selling price of the inventory less selling cost. As we sold this inventory, we assigned the stepped up value to the cost of sales and recognized minimal profit on these sales.", "In March we did not record the profit that we normally would have recorded if the inventory had been valued at cost. The step up reduced income for the month of March by $7 million, or $0.12 per share after-tax.", "We expect to sell the remainder of the written off inventory this quarter, which will reduce June quarter income by $3 million, or $0.05 per share after-tax, after which there will be no further such charges and we will begin to recognize the normal ongoing profit margins at Southern Container's plants.", "We incurred $1.1 million or $0.02 per share for integration expenses during the quarter. We expect to incur similar expenses over the next year that we will track and disclose. We do not expect that these expenses will be very material in the context of an acquisition this size.", "As we explained when we announced the acquisition, Southern Container had in place long-term deferred compensation arrangements for certain senior executives that required the accumulated balances to be fully funded at the time of the acquisition and then held in escrow for one year while the employee continued to work for us, if requested to do so.", "These escrows were funded at closing by these selling shareholders, and the funds will either be paid to the employee or returned to the shareholders if the employees fail to satisfy the employment obligations.", "Under GAAP, even though the funds are not Rock-Tenn's, and Rock-Tenn cannot receive them under any circumstances and they were largely previously expensed by Southern Container, Rock-Tenn most record the entire fund balance as expensed over the one-year employment period following the closing of the acquisition.", "This pretax charge was $700,000 in March, and we will expense the remaining $7.8 million, or $0.13 per share over the next 11 months. We will refer to these expenses by the plan's initials, ESU. We will call them ESU expenses in future earnings releases and just refer back to this discussion.", "Turning back to the consolidated results for the quarter, on an adjusted basis Rock-Tenn earned $0.66 per share, $0.09 or 16% more than the $0.57 per share reported in the second quarter of last year. The acquisition contributed $0.05 during the 29 days that we owned Southern Container in the quarter.", "Rock-Tenn's combined recycled capacity is now 1.89 million tons. This includes 904,000 tons of containerboard capacity, 986,000 tons of recycled paperboard capacity, including 606,000 tons of coated recycled paperboard and 380,000 tons of specialty paperboard.", "Turning to the results of our Paperboard segment, realized prices for paperboard and pulp grades increased $30 per ton over last year's March quarter. Production of these grades increased by 4% over last year. Fiber, energy, chemical and freight costs increased by $37 per ton, accounting for the $1.2 million decline in Paperboard segment income.", "Rock-Tenn's cost of recycled fiber for our Paperboard segment was $141 per ton in the quarter, up $30 per ton over last year, and an increase of $1.00 per ton from the December quarter. The April index for OCC in Chicago is $120 per ton, the same as last month but higher than the average index of $93 per ton in the March quarter of 2007 and $112 per ton in the December quarter of 2007.", "Turning to energy costs, NYMEX prices were up $1.27 per MMbtu over the March quarter of last year. Based on current market conditions, the June quarter will be in the range of $10.65 per MMbtu, about $3.00 higher than the $7.55 per MMbtu NYMEX closing price in the March quarter of last year.", "Rock-Tenn's annual consumption of natural gas and fuel oil is approximately 9 Bcf. This includes half of a Bcf of natural gas used at Southern Container. The Solvay mill's steam source is coal-based. Rock-Tenn's freight costs, excluding Southern Container were $3 million higher than last year on the 8% increase in sales.", "The increase in freight costs resulted from increased fuel costs which were paid as fuel surcharges to carriers to compensate them for higher fuel costs. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $19.3 million below depreciation and amortization of $31.6 million. For fiscal year 2008, we continue to expect our capital expenditures to be in the range of $90 million to $95 million.", "This includes project to increase the capacity of paper machine #2 at Solvay Paperboard by 33,000 tons per year. This project will take place in the June quarter and will take approximately two weeks. We expect to lose about 10,000 tons of production during this time.", "After we complete the project, we expect the capacity of the Solvay mill to be 753,000 tons per year. Our current estimate of Rock-Tenn's ongoing combined annual depreciation and amortization is $145 million per year. This may change as we finalize the purchase accounting of the Southern Container acquisition.", "Rock-Tenn's total debt was $1.85 billion at the end of March. Our net debt which deducts the cash on our balance sheet at the end of March was $1.77 billion. Rock-Tenn's pro forma credit agreement EBITDA for the 12 months ending March 2008 was $448.5 million.", "Using the $448.5 million and our debt levels at the end of March, our credit agreement debt-to-EBITDA ratio as of the end of the quarter was 4.04 times as compared to our covenant of five times that will be effective from June 2008 through the end of this fiscal year. A reconciliation of these numbers to Rock-Tenn's and Southern Container's financial statements is posted as a presentation on our website at www.rocktenn.com.", "We show $113.6 million of cash due to sellers at the end of March. This will return the cash required to be held under the terms of the industrial development bonds at Solvay Paperboard and also keep the sellers hold for the taxes they will pay as part of the Section 338(h)(10) election we agreed to make as part of the acquisition. The total amount will be repaid to the sellers in November of this year.", "We have fixed a portion of our bank debt for a period of four years and at a LIBOR rate of 3.11%. This leaves us with about 65% of our debt at fixed rates through the middle of 2011. Rock-Tenn's effective tax rate for the March quarter of fiscal 2008 was approximately 37%, somewhat higher than the 36% rate in fiscal year 2007.", "We expect Rock-Tenn's overall effective tax rate, reflecting the Southern Container acquisition to be 37%. Rock-Tenn's net cash provided by operating activities was $12.7 million in the quarter, compared to $36.9 million in the prior year quarter.", "Accounts Receivable excluding Southern Container, increased $29 million in the quarter. Rock-Tenn contributed $9 million to our pension plans, and we made $17 million of cash tax payments during the March quarter.", "We expect to contribute another $4 million to our pension plans over the balance of this fiscal year, bringing our total contribution for the year to be approximately $16 million. We continue to expect strong cash flow from operations over the next six months, and we continue to expect to reduce our debt-to-EBITDA ratio to below three times by September 2010.", "Jim will now discuss our operating results and outlook. Jim?", "Jim Rubright", "Thanks, Steve. Rock-Tenn had another terrific quarter in March, particularly when you consider the cost environment that we experienced, and the relative weakness in general economic activity.", "Packaging and Paperboard posted solid results with good volume gains and the Merchandising Display business hit sales and earnings records at new high levels. Southern Container's plants performed at the high end of our expectations and increased our earnings by $0.05. As Steve said, this is well ahead of the pro forma historical accretion we included in our SEC filings last month.", "I am going to comment on each of these in turn starting with packaging. Demand for our packaging products, folding cartons and partitions for glass products continue to pace during the quarter inconsistent with the last year. Industry data shows that folding carton volumes were up about 0.8%.", "Our volume growth was higher by approximately 2% measured primarily by square feet of paperboard converted. Our people have done a terrific job in picking the right customers who have been growing their sales and the right product segments for this business. Our sales growth has allowed us to better leverage our fixed cost base, and to keep our margins, which were 4.9% for the quarter, essentially at our target return on sales of 5% for this business.", "I attribute this to the fact that our people have just done an excellent job of managing two critical drivers of our business results over the past year and a half. First is passing through paperboard and other cost increases through product price increases. The second is the reducing of our overall production cost to more than offset other cost escalations and materials, energy, freight and labor costs.", "As I mentioned, we had another record quarter in Merchandising Displays. Here our employees have done a particularly good job of expanding our position with some of our major customers, i.e. picking up more products and our shares of their promotional budgets. Also, the demand for promotional displays has continued to be very strong.", "Our 14.5% return on sales in this segment was at the high end of our expected range, and here I attribute that to two principal factors. The first is better leveraging our fixed cost due to the high sales volume, and secondly we've been increasing the mix of our revenues that are from design and component manufacturing, which have better margins than fulfillment, because we have been increasing the proportion of our lower margin fulfillment business that we performed through our PPSI minority joint-venture which provides a suite of products including fulfillment of third-party logistics and the provision of the actual displays.", "Our Paperboard sales in tons shipped increased in the quarter as we disclosed. Our earnings were very good, particularly given the high energy and recycled fiber costs we experienced during the quarter.", "Paperboard pricing was up over the prior year quarter, and our attention to operating efficiency gains and the capacity gains we have achieved over the last year in coated recycled paperboard, nearly managed to offset the narrowing of Paperboard selling price margins over fiber and other cost increases.", "Our mills have actually run better late in the quarter in April than they did in the first part of the March quarter, which explains in part the 9.5% return on sales in the March quarter, which is a little lower than the 11% return on sales we experienced in the prior year quarter.", "I would like to take a moment at this point to comment on the cost position we have achieved in our coated recycled paperboard business and to compliment our mill employers who have done just a fantastic job of reducing waste, improving quality, increasing production and reducing energy consumption.", "The cost positions achieved lead our industry as I will explain the reason why I'm going into this in some detail. First, I think you are all aware how important we feel it is for our assets to occupy the left side of the cost curve. This is the place where we think we can make money throughout the business cycles.", "This is what has driven our acquisition strategy over the last few years. We acquired the Demopolis bleach board mill, which the industry experts we consulted at the time believed to be the lowest cost bleach board mill in North America. Also, there was this year's acquisition of the Solvay mill, one of the lowest cost recycled containerboard mills in North America. Since it is one of the newest mills, it's structurally advantaged with its coal-based steam source.", "Coated recycled paperboard is our second largest grade after containerboard, with over 600,000 tons of annual capacity. Our employees have worked extremely well over the last few years to improve their cost position. What we have not been able to do well in this sector until recently is compare our cost structure to that of our competitors.", "There are published cost curves for coated recycled paperboard mills in North America. Unlike the cost curves that we have looked at for the other grades, we typically found that the coated recycled board cost curves didn't accurately reflect our costs. This gave us concern over the overall accuracy of these cost curves.", "Recently this situation changed. Our largest competitor recently published an industry cost curve that gave investors and us a cash cost for their six coated recycled paperboard mills. They also included in this investor presentation estimates of the cash cost of our five mills and the six other mills in North America, in which not surprisingly since they published this chart in an investor presentation they estimated the cash cost of our mills to be higher than the cash cost of theirs.", "First, we are going to assume that they know the cost of their mills. And secondly, I wish to state that of their estimate for the five other independent mills in their study is accurate. It is not that critical to the point I am making because the three largest of those mills are generally recognized as very high cost for reasons that are very well-known in the industry, and two of those three are located on the West Coast.", "The publication of this cost curve has given us the ability to compare our actual cost to the actual cost of our competitors. Since our competitor widely published that data, we felt it was incumbent upon us to set the record straight. The actual facts are that based on their costs regarding their mills, our two largest Coated Recycled Paperboard mills are the two lowest cost coated recycled paperboard mills in North America.", "In addition, a multi-mill owner doesn't just price their lowest cost mill; she prices at least with an eye to her system cost, the cost of all the mills she owns. Based on our competitor's study and our cost data, we can further state with confidence that our average system cost for our five coated recycled paperboard mills is the lowest cost recycled paperboard system in North America.", "This didn't surprise us because we felt that our results were telling us that our costs had to be better than they were generally thought to be. But it is comforting knowledge for us given our view of the fundamentals that drive our paperboard business and our belief that the low cost provider. If our costs are low enough, we will be profitable throughout the business cycles.", "Our Corrugated Packaging segment performed very well in the quarter. As we said in the press release, our legacy corrugated plant operations continued to grow their sales and their earnings, and Southern Container with its $0.05 per share accretion to earnings in 29 days performed very well.", "Also, since we had just completed the acquisition, we had very little time to recognize any synergies. Essentially these results represent no combination benefits. Our integration planning for the acquisition has really gone quite well. We recently announced internally last week our integration plans, which contemplate a full integration of our legacy plant into the acquired operations, which we had not committed to doing when we announced the acquisition.", "We have a lot of the integration work ahead. This being in Systems in-process integration, production optimization, and the internalizing of current outside purchases of Corrugated Packaging. We will spend several million dollars in transition costs primarily over the next six months to get there.", "But with the work we have done, we are very confident that within a year we will comfortably exceed the $10 million run rate of synergies target we announced in January. That $15 million was one of those slips that we referred to, and I actually would be confident of establishing a target at that level as well.", "I'm going to now turn to our outlook. First of all, demand for paperboard remains good. Demand for bleached paperboard is very good with lengthening backlogs. In fact, I believe the backlogs we have today at the Demopolis mill are the strongest that we have had since we have owned it.", "Industry data for uncoated recycled paperboard suggests that operating rates are in the low 90s, and that unmade orders improved through mid-April. Our operating rates are at about that level. Coated Recycled Paperboard operating rates year-to-date are 100%, although we saw some weakness in operating rates in mid-April.", "The folding carton volumes were very strong obviously in the March quarter. We have continued to see strong demand for folding cartons in the month of April. There is also a strong demand in our partition business where we are seeing a continuation of growth that tracks the growth and the sales of beverage glass in North America.", "Demand for Corrugated Packaging on the other hand, is showing some signs of weakness. On the cost side, Steve referred to the current high-fiber energy and freight costs, all of which were higher than they were last year. For this coming quarter, we see OCC pricing actually coming down as export pricing has weakened and our costs for OCC should improve as seasonal generation increases recycled fiber supply this spring.", "Natural gas is currently over $10 in Mcf however, and with fiber currently at $120 per ton OBM pricing, we believe that the right side of the cost curve for recycled paperboard and containerboard particularly are under severe pressure to further increase pricing to cover cash operating costs.", "I said including containerboard. My comment really with respect to that sort of extreme price pressure relative to cash costs is actually focused on recycled paperboard, particularly coated recycled paperboard.", "In that regard, although natural gas costs are very important to us in the production of recycled paperboard, we have materially changed Rock-Tenn's overall sensitivity to natural gas cost increases as a percentage of total energy costs with our last two acquisitions.", "The 430,000 tons of bleached board and market pulp we produce at our Demopolis bleach board mill, rely primarily on the mill's recovery boiler for process energy requirements, and only about 20% of their total purchased energy requirements for fuel sources are natural gas. And the 720,000 tons of containerboard we produced at our Solvay mill have coal-based steam pricing.", "As a result, today if you look and do the numbers on the basis of the tons produced, natural gas makes up about 29% of our purchase fuel portfolio, residual fuel oil, another 15%. Coal makes up the balance with the exception of about 100,000 tons of gypsum liner that we produced, which we passed through the cost of purchase fuel to our customer.", "So we think we are in much better shape than the industry participants generally with respect to the overall production, particularly of Recycled Paperboard from a fuel source. On the pricing side, we've made good progress with the last round of price increases. And, indeed, the industry has done a good job passing those prices through.", "The index for bleached paperboard was up $10 last month for a total of $30 per ton for the most recently announced increase. And coated recycled paperboard index prices are up $25 on the low end, of which together with bleached board represents over 900,000 tons of our total production. These price increases are welcome. We expect to recover them as we normally do in phases primarily over the next six months.", "In our converting businesses, however you will see a further lag in GAAP earnings. We expect these increases will result in the normal LIFO inventory cost increases in our Packaging segment as these higher paperboard inventory prices get built into our inventories.", "The net effect of all this is that I believe Rock-Tenn should continue to generate strong cash flow and earnings, and Steve and I believe our goal of reducing our debt-to-EBITDA ratio to less than three times by the end of fiscal 2010 is the right target for us.", "With those prepared comments, Steve and I are prepared to respond to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question does come from Claudia Hueston of JPMorgan. You may ask your question.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "Hi, thanks very much. Good morning.", "Jim Rubright", "Good morning, Claudia.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "Just a couple of questions, one was on just the Southern Container contribution. $0.05 a share was more than we had expected as well. Just wondered if you could talk a little bit more specifically about where the strength was, and how your expectations really track now going forward for that asset?", "Jim Rubright", "Yes. The strength was in two sources. The first was the contribution of income from the Solvay mill. And secondly, better performance from the graphics side of their packaging business than we had expected. The Solvay mill performed very well. It just operated great during the quarter, and its production was up a little bit over our expectations.", "And then, we had expected a little higher recycled fiber cost than we actually saw. We had expected fiber pricing to really strengthen in the March quarter, and in fact, it really didn't, and at the end of the quarter in April, as you know we think the market is weakening, so that is the principal driver for the improvement.", "But the trajectory of earnings of the Southern Container business all through the year improved, so actually the 12-month historical did not really reflect the full run-rate, so a little bit of the effect was that, Claudia, but the other was that the mill and graphics business performed ahead of expectations.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "Okay. That is helpful. And how should we think about the outage that is happening at the Solvay mill? That's for the coming quarter, am I right, and can you quantify that?", "Jim Rubright", "It is. I think just on production tons lost, you've got a loss in earnings per share, and then with disruption and everything else going on in the mill, I think you could see $0.05 a share plus or minus. It might be a little bit less than that, but it might be a little more.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "Okay, perfect. And then just on the Displays business. Can you comment a little bit on what you're seeing there in terms of the near-term outlook? Are there any signs of weakness, or how should we think about that business, which just has really done very well over last couple of quarters?", "Jim Rubright", "It really has, and we do not see any change. Demand continues to be good into late April, which is as far as we can see, and we just measure that by mainly by sheets produced in the converting business, because that ultimately drives the value chain all the way down the line and business continues to be strong.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then just finally, are there any hedges in place for natural gas going forward?", "Jim Rubright", "There are not.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Christopher Chun of Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Yeah, thanks. Good morning, guys. I just wanted to follow-up a little more on the accretion that you saw from the Southern deal. $0.05 is, again quite a lot more than we expected from such a short period of time. And I am wondering, Jim, if you think that sort of that rate of accretion is sustainable for the rest of the year, so that we are looking at something like $0.60 of accretion for the year?", "Jim Rubright", "The answer to that question is I do with the exception of the outage that we're going to take for the capacity increase, which is a terrific project that we talked about. That's going to cost about $0.05. I think the questions for us really relate to continued market conditions for Corrugated Packaging, and then what happens to fiber pricing and energy pricing, energy pricing being less significant for us than the Solvay mill.", "But the answer is, if we have a continuation of the business conditions that we experienced from January 1 through March 31, the answer is yes. I think it's a sustainable rate of accretion.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "That's very impressive. And then I wanted to ask about you mentioned that prices were going higher in a couple of your Paperboard grades. And I am wondering if you see a sort of typical rate of follow through in terms of your realizations, how much you would expect this quarter's average prices in those grades to be higher than last quarter?", "Jim Rubright", "Right. Well, we were starting to get the first 20 of the SBS a little bit in the quarter, but really not significantly. Because, as you know, you have to get them published before you get your contract pricing up, and then that contract pricing accretes primarily over a six-month period of time from publication.", "So I think in this quarter you are going to start to see spot tons move to the full 30 there, and I think you will see movement in CRB, but it will take six to nine months to get them fully reflected in our pricing.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then the impact of that pricing on your Consumer Packaging business, will you actually see some margin compression there as you raise your package products prices, is there a lag there?", "Jim Rubright", "We always do, right. Because what happens is you ultimately, because we are on LIFO, and part of our competitors are on LIFO, and part of them are not, so you don't get an apples-to-apples comparison for everybody relating to product pricing. But you do get margin compression in your packaging business. As the LIFO inventory charges increase, your LIFO expense for the period in which you are in the process of passing those price increases through.", "And for us it's not dramatic, but it might be $1 million a quarter to $2 million a quarter depending upon how broadly across our product categories that occur, so it shows up $2 million, or $0.03 or $0.04 of earnings, but it is a good thing, it is not bad. Because ultimately once you pass that cost through, your earnings then normalize out.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, very good. And then can you give us a little more detail on what we can expect in terms of interest expense by quarter?", "Jim Rubright", "Yes, Steve. How about you do that.", "Steve Voorhees", "Yeah. Our run rate of interest expense on an annual basis at current LIBOR is about $115 million per year.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Right.", "Steve Voorhees", "Take that and divide by 4, and that would be the quarterly.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Right. And then how much of your debt is indexed to LIBOR?", "Steve Voorhees", "Right now we are about 35% floating. And so some of that would move with commercial paper, but that is very closely related to LIBOR.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thanks for your help.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our next question does come from Kevin Casey of Casey Capital. You may ask your question.", "Kevin Casey - Casey Capital", "A couple of questions. One, what was that CapEx number?", "Jim Rubright", "$90 million to $95 million for the year.", "Kevin Casey - Casey Capital", "Okay. And then the 140 was the depreciation number?", "Steven Voorhees", "Yeah. 90 to 95 would be for the full year of fiscal year '08.", "Kevin Casey - Casey Capital", "Okay. And then can you talk a little more detailed about price and price increases? I'm hearing in certain segments that the customers aren't accepting some of the price increases.", "Jim Rubright", "", "Well, the place that.", "Kevin Casey - Casey Capital", "And they are struggling to go through?", "Jim Rubright", "Well, one you are referring to, Kevin, I think is the $50 announcement of an increase in pricing for containerboard, and that one did not go through in March. And a lot of people would then expect that the next best time for that to go would be late in the summer, which is the pattern of the last major containerboard increase.", "But on the SBS side and CRB, I think SBS is very solidly done and reflected in the index. And as I mentioned in CRB, industry volumes have been high, but the right side of the cost curve is really under pressure to get prices up with costs at these levels, so I think that there is a solid basis to continue to see the CRB prices increase through the marketplace.", "It is going to be dependent upon continued demand for the grade, but I think the cost increase, our mill division didn't really increase its income this year to last year, because the cost increases have matched essentially the pricing increases we have gotten, so I think you continue to see that the right side of the cost curve hasn't really made up any ground.", "But I think that bodes well for continued discipline in the market place regarding pricing.", "Kevin Casey - Casey Capital", "Then what's the bigger driver for higher prices, the increasing cost or just overall supply and demand?", "Jim Rubright", "Well, absent the tightness in supply and demand, and we do have balance right now. It is pretty difficult to raise prices. On the other hand, in the current cost environment, if you saw price erosion, you would have people running below cash costs.", "And last time that happened, it ultimately resulted in a significant round of capacity closures, which then followed with pricing power with the remaining people, so I think my personal belief is that the right side of the cost curve, as I have stated, is under strong pressure to recover additional price to cover the costs.", "Kevin Casey - Casey Capital", "Okay, great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions).

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Jason Thompson. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jason Thompson - Director, Investor Relations", "Thanks Rich and good morning everyone. This morning we announced our results before the market opened. The notification of this morning's call was broadly disclosed. Further, this morning's call is being webcast at mwv.com. Slides that accompany this call are available there as well. I'll briefly remind you that certain statements we make may be forward-looking and are not guarantees of future performance, and are subjected to known and unknown risks and uncertainties described in our public filings. Furthermore, contents containing time sensitive information that although correct today, may change with the passage of time.", "First, a brief recap of the results we reported this morning. For the first quarter we reported a net loss from continuing operations of $8 million or $0.04 per share, included in the results are after-tax charges totaling $10 million or $0.06 per share, for restructuring and bad debt and an after-tax gain of $6 million or $0.04 per share related to the company's U.S. pension plan.", "Now, here to tell you more about our results for the first quarter are John Luke, Chairman and CEO, Jim Buzzard our President and Mark Rajkowski our CFO.", "I'll now turn the call over to John.", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Jason and good morning. During the first quarter, we made progress in our profitable growth strategy and generated strong sales momentum across targeted markets, especially outside of the United States. That said our overall performance was disappointing. Our profitability was impacted by dramatic cost inflation that was greater than we had anticipated, principally due to the sharp run-up in oil and energy related prices, by unexpected customer bankruptcies and maintenance expenses. These factors along with the normal seasonal weakness of the first quarter in several of our businesses, adversely affected our results.", "As we look at the quarter however, there were positive developments and clear evidence that our company is moving in the right direction by focusing on the right markets and the right strategies to win in those markets. First, our commercial performance was solid and we are developing plans to make it even stronger.", "Overall sales in our packaging businesses were up 7%, including a 23% increase to emerging markets; markets including China, India, Brazil and importantly Eastern and Central Europe. We increased sales volume for higher value paperboard grades and storing sales growth in global beverage packaging, home and garden solutions and in personal care segment such as fragrance.", "In addition, our innovative healthcare packaging solution, Shellpak is beginning to be rolled out as part of Wal-Mart's prescription drug program. This commercial momentum demonstrates that our packaging solutions are generating solid demand in the market place, including the markets that we have targeted for growth around the world. We are now developing additional plans to build upon this success.", "As we continue to refine our go-to-market strategy, a logical next step is to align the full breadth of our packaging platform capabilities for each market segment that we serve. Already, we have dedicated teams working across our platform to improve our product development and commercial success in the healthcare and personal care markets. We will soon look to replicate this commercial model with a more deliberate shift to a structure that focuses our sales and marketing efforts on each of our targeted markets and key customers. This along with activities already underway will enhance our commercial success while also generating important operational and execution related efficiencies.", "Second, we took specific actions to bolster productivity and profitability in the face of rapid inflation for energy and raw materials. These rising cost impacted results for all of our businesses during the quarter. While are we continued to make real progress and pricing in mix improvement, we are pursuing even more aggressive pricing across all of our businesses. This is a key operating imperative in an economy in which oil is more than $110 per barrel and related costs continue to escalate. Simply off setting pricing... offsetting inflation is not acceptable, so we must continue to drive pricing wherever possible.", "Third, we are continuing to sharpen our focus on higher margin packaging opportunities. Three weeks ago, we announced the sale of our kraft mill in North Charleston, South Carolina for $485 million in cash. While this mill has been an important part of our success for many years, the linerboard and saturating kraft capacity of this mill was no longer an optimal fit for our long-term consumer packaging strategy and the proceed will allow us to further strengthen our financial position.", "As I am sure all of you can imagine, the sale took some time to complete with challenges over the course of the past year or more, including the recent credit crisis. But we were determined to stay the course in this transaction to obtain full and fair value for our shareholders.", "Before I turn to Jim and Mark for a more in-depth look at our operations and financial performance, let me talk briefly about two other important developments since our last call. We have been keeping you updated on our strategy to maximize the value of our land holding. We recently shared a preliminary master plan for our large East Edisto property with the community in South Carolina, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive.", "Over the course of several years, the plan provides for towns, workplaces and conservation areas that we believe will address the needs of the community of simultaneously rewarding our shareholders with sustainable cash flow and substantial long-term value. Also, and as you have noticed we have adopted a new MWV logo and are now referring to ourselves as MWV. This new branding is a reflection of the work we have completed over the past several years to transform our business and to redefine our value proposition by providing customers with unique packaging solutions that enhance the performance of their brands. The change has been well received in the marketplace and we expect to continue to see the benefits of our enhanced brand identity as we go forward.", "Collectively, these areas of progress and improvement demonstrate that while the economic environment is challenging and frankly may become even more so, we are executing well on the right things, the things that we can directly control. Our sales and pricing performance in the marketplace and the efficiency of our organization.", "We are growing revenue and enhancing our product mix by focusing our leading global packaging platform on targeted markets and customers around the world. We continue to take decisive actions to improve our overall profitability through aggressive pricing measures and productivity programs and finally we are continue to hone our focus on higher value consumer packaging businesses to improve our return profile for shareholders.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to Jim Buzzard and following Jim, Mark Rajkowski to discuss our performance in greater detail. Jim.", "James A. Buzzard - President", "Thank you, John. The operating environment for many of our businesses was very difficult during the first quarter. Input cost inflation accelerated during the quarter. We had operating difficulties at two of our packaging plants and we felt the impact of two customer bankruptcies. Our performance reflects these challenging conditions.", "Despite these challenges, we made good progress in the global marketplace, especially in markets we have targeted for growth. Our top line... our strong top line performance in the packaging business confirms that our strategy is working and that we can deliver more of this growth to the bottom line through ongoing pricing and productivity actions.", "We must continue to take pricing actions to offset the impact of dramatic input cost inflation. Measurable progress in these areas is our priority as we move through the year. I'll now discuss specific segment results for the first quarter in more detail as well as some of the operating highlights in market performance in each business.", "You will find additional information for all of our business segments in the slide presentation of the company in this call. The packaging resources segment delivered positive volume growth across most major paperboard grades. Including for beverage multipacks, liquid packaging and commercial print applications, and the segment may progress offsetting historically high input costs with price and mix improvements but more work remains.", "Our volume and price gains were not enough to drive profitability higher overall. Input cost inflation was an obvious factor but we also experienced higher cost for the plant maintenance outage of our Mahrt paperboard mill in Alabama which totaled about $15 million. No similar outage occurred last year and as a result, segment earnings were $11 million below last year's level.", "We are continuing to gain global market share for high quality paperboard. We had solid gains in emerging markets including the 14% increase in sales to China and double digit sales and earnings improvement for Rigesa. Overall, backlogs in our higher value paperboard grades are solid and we are aggressively pursuing price increases. Productivity was positive for the quarter at the mills other than Mahrt, and while that doesn't show up on our waterfalls for this quarter, we expect productivity to be a positive driver for the mill businesses moving forward.", "In our consumer solution segment, sales increased overall but earnings were significantly below last year's level. Input costs were a major factor, and some of our U.S. businesses began to feel the impact of the weaker economy. In addition, our media business incurred a one-time charge of $5 million related to the bankruptcy of a single European customer. These issues obscured our commercial success and productivity improvements during the quarter that we expect will translate in a profitable growth moving forward. Demand in many of our markets is strong and we have made gains in global beverage, home and garden, fragrance and healthcare.", "For instance, we won additional business from key CPG customers such as Procter & Gamble, Unilever, SC Johnson and Clorox. And overall productivity improved in CSG. With the footprint decisions we made last year and ongoing productivity programs, including actions in our media business that would have helped to restore year-over-year profit growth in that business, were it not for the bad debts charges.", "Let me talk in more detail about what we are seeing in each of the CSG lines of business. First, demand range remains solid for our largest consumer business, global food and beverage. In Europe, we are seeing increased carton volumes in machinery sales, including growing relationship with Scottish Courage. As they take share in the European beer market, we are gaining volume along with them.", "In North America, growth is steady, but there are signs of a weaker economy and a slowdown in consumer spending. Nonetheless, we have had continued increases with Anheuser-Busch and recent success with Labatt.", "In the media business, we continue to see market related volume declines and unfavorable mix. However, we have a strong pipeline of movies titles in Europe and we have doubled our video game business with Nintendo. We also have the industry accepted packaging format for Blu-Ray DVD and we expect to see increasing orders for this solution as Sony's preferred HD technology won a decisive victory over the rival format.", "In healthcare, the big story is the success of Shellpak, our innovative adherence packaging solution. During the quarter, we produced Shellpak for several products in Wal-Mart's prescription drug program in the United States. And we are enthusiastic about the planned expansion by Wal-Mart and the potential for other retailers who are also exploring this unique solution. In addition to the success of Shellpak, sales of our pharmaceutical pumps increased again during the first quarter and we are looking to commercialize two new pump formats in the second half of this year.", "Sales on our global personal care business increased compared to last year, led by a strong performance for our cosmetic pumps, fragrance dispensers and foaming and airless technologies in Europe and other international markets. We have launched new products with Colgate and Avon and we are adding capacity with the new press in our Russia facility that will support specialty packaging for these segments of the rapidly growing Russian market.", "In our home and garden business, sales increased by almost 20%. We have won market share by participating in Clorox's Green Works product line with our home cleaning trigger sprayers and we saw an increase in business from Scott's Miracle-Gro. You may remember that home and garden business was a negative factor in previous quarters, due to drought conditions last year, but we are now seeing positive signs moving into the busy season for lawn and garden care. We have also seen good growth from our new Wuxi facility in China, serving SC Johnson and high profile local customers with trigger sprayers for home cleaning products.", "Overall, the consumer solutions segment exited the quarter with strong momentum. We expect to see improvement moving forward as we align our commercial organization to increase our value proposition to customers, execute pricing and productivity actions and leverage our innovation pipeline for targeted packaging markets.", "Turning to our non-packaging businesses, results for the consumer and office product segment were about the same during the traditionally slow first quarter. This segment normally reports a small loss in the first quarter as they built inventory for the important back-to-school season.", "Consumer office products had a strong back-to-school season in Brazil and recorded pricing and mix improvements during the quarter as this business continues to focus on value-added proprietary products. However, this segment incurred a $3 million charge for bad debt for one of our Brazilian customers, keeping a small loss in this segment unchanged compared to last year.", "This segment continues to perform well, driving productivity gains and product mix enhancements to offset some of the continuing input cost inflation and the risks associated with the current retail environment. The specialty chemical segment achieved solid performance compared to a very week first quarter in 2007. This segment implemented significant pricing actions and productivity projects during the quarter to offset dramatic ongoing input cost inflation. These actions will continue as this business experiences unprecedented increases in key chemical raw materials such as petrochemicals and phosphoric acid.", "In our carbon business, growth in sales to non-U.S. auto markets and gains for non-auto purification applications partially offset weakness in the U.S. auto market. In addition, we continue to generate solid momentum for our Evotherm warm paving asphalt technology.", "Let me also update you on the acquisition of the pine chemicals product lines for Eastman Chemical Company. The integration of these product lines has been exceptionally smooth and is already having a positive impact on our operating leverage in this business. As the transition continues, we expect this business to be accretive to our earnings in 2008.", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss some of our financial metrics for the first quarter. Mark.", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Jim. The seasonally slow first quarter for our business was both difficult and disappointing. The impact of input cost inflation was much more severe than we had expected and eroded much of the margin improvement we had planned from our strong pricing and mixed actions. Higher than expected cost related to our Mahrt mill outage and our program to shift production capacity to lower cost locations also impacted margins. We are however, successfully getting price and are beginning to generate good momentum in the market place with new product introductions and by leveraging our emerging markets investments.", "Before I review our financial performance in more detail, I would like to touch on the pending sale of our mill North Charleston, South Carolina. The sale of the Charleston kraft mill was a very long and complex deal to negotiate, but it is an important strategic move and we are pleased with the value we will receive from the sale of this asset. It will sharpen our focus on higher value consumer packaging products and will further reduce the volatility of our earnings and cash flows by exceeding the highly cyclical linerboard market.", "The after-tax proceeds from the sale are expected to be approximately $400 million and will be used to repay debt, which is in keeping with our balanced approach to deploying excess cash having recently repurchased $400 million of stock, with the forest land proceeds. We believe the timing was right for this transaction, which we expect will result in a modest after-tax gain.", "Now, turning to our financial results for the quarter. First, keep in mind that in making year-over-year comparisons, all prior year numbers have been restated to reflective results of our continuing operations on apples-to-apples basis. The results of our Charleston kraft papers business have been excluded and are separately reported as discontinued operations.", "Starting with sales, we saw a strengthening in our top-line across all of our businesses, resulting in an overall growth of 6% year-over-year. Our improvement was driven primarily by higher selling prices, mixed improvement in foreign exchange. Top-line growth outside the U.S. and Canada in the packaging platform was 16% reflecting export growth in our major paperboard grades and solid performance in our non-U.S. beverage, personal care, home and garden and tobacco businesses. Especially chemicals business also posted double-digit growth on the strength of its pine chemical business.", "Our gross profit in the first quarter adjusted for restructuring charges in one time items was $225 million or 15% of sales, which is 170 bases point decline compared to the year ago quarter. This decline was primarily the result of about $40 million of higher input cost across all business units and lower productivity primarily due to higher than expected cost associated with the Mahrt outage and manufacturing optimization moves in the consumer solutions group.", "We are continuing to improve asset efficiency of the consumer solution group by implementing a more global manufacturing strategy that fully leverages both lowest cost locations and our enhanced global capabilities in supply chain and procurement. As part of this on going work, in the quarter we moved high cost Western European tobacco and personal care packaging businesses to our lower cost facilities in Moscow. We also further expand the capacity of our Wuxi China facility to one, take advantage of the strong growth we're experiencing in the regions specifically in Home and garden and personal care markets and two, to supply lower cost product to U.S. and European customers.", "These actions will provide us with a lower manufacturing cost base for CSG products going forward but resulted in about $5 million of incremental cost in the quarter. Partially offsetting these negative impacts to gross margin were price improvements as well as positive foreign exchange. We are continuing to aggressively pursue additional price increases to help offset cost inflation, which we expect will continue to be a significant headwind in 2008 as oil remains at historically higher levels. Progress in reducing SG&A cost during the quarter was massed by $8 million of charges due to two customer's bankruptcies. With regard to credit risk in our accounts receivable portfolio certainly the weakening economic climate has increased overall credit risks. However we have thoroughly reviewed the credit and liquidity position of each of our customers and believe that there are no additional material at risk accounts at this time. Adjusted SG&A in the most recent quarter was a $195 million or 12.8% of sales, down more than a full percentage point compared to last year. Cost reductions more than offset the increases due to inflation.", "Turning to cash, during the quarter our cash from continuing operations about $35 million, our cash performance reflects the traditional seasonal weakness we experience across many of our businesses in the first quarter which lowers operating earnings. It also reflects higher tax payments we made in the quarter, inventory build for the back-to-school season and a higher level of receivables due to increased sales. However from an overall efficiency perspective, we continue to show improvement with a year-over-year reduction in our cash to cash cycle of four days. Turning to our outlook for the second quarter, there is significant volatility in many key macro-economic factors that limits our visibility.", "While a number of our businesses are entering seasonally stronger selling periods like beverage and home and garden, weakening trends and consumer spending and housing market coupled with rapid increases in and key input costs makes it extremely difficult to provide a high degree of confidence around outlook information. With that as context, we are encouraged by the current backlogs in our mill business. They are at or above prior year level. We are continuing to aggressively pursue price increase across all grades; however with oil continuing to reach new records, we may not be able to fully off-set input cost increases with price improvement during the current quarter. Productivity in the quarter will be impacted by a scheduled full outage of the Covington bleached board mill. As a result we expect segment profit to be slightly below year ago levels.", "In the consumer solutions segment, we are expecting segment profit to be higher versus the year ago period. We expect volume growth and the global beverage packaging, home and garden business.", "In addition we are seeing good momentum in healthcare packaging particularly as Shellpak gets rolled out nation wide with Wal-Mart and in global personal care with continued growth in high end fragrance pump. We should also see lower manufacturing driven by the benefits from our actions to optimize our manufacturing foot print.", "In consumer and office products business, segment profit is expected to be below year ago levels. Given weakening consumer spending trends, we are seeing our retail customers tightly manage their inventory levels. This likely will push back-to-school orders into the third quarter closer to the point of sale.", "Specialty chemicals, segment profit is expected to be above year ago levels. Increased pricing in pine chemicals and productivity will more than offset expected weakness in automotive and housing markets. With that, I'll turn it back to John.", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Mark. While the first quarter certainly brought challenges, we are encouraged by the positive momentum to growth in our key markets, in the pricing improvement we achieved in many of our businesses. And our markets remain strong. And then what is... and likely will remain a challenging environment, we are relentlessly focused on managing the things that we can directly influence driving price and mix improvements to offset still amounting cost inflation and on executing productivity improvements.", "All while continuing to invest for growth in our global packaging platform. We are confident that we will continue to succeed by differentiating ourselves in the marketplace and building brand value for our customers. This concludes our prepared remarks, we are pleased to answer any questions that you have.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. We will start out with the line of Claudia Hueston with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Claudia Hueston - J.P. Morgan", "Thanks very much, good morning.", "James A. Buzzard - President", "Good morning Claudia.", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning Claudia.", "Claudia Hueston - J.P. Morgan", "Just had, a sort of a broad question first just in terms what you are seeing from the consumer and if you are getting any sense of substitution or changing consumer trends, specifically in the consumer and office product business and then may be on your fragrance business as well, are you seeing any sense that may be the customers is trying to trade down at all?", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Jim you want to comment there... I mean my sense says that we are continuing to see reasonably firm momentum in all of our markets. Claudia as we have topped and we have not certainly in the packaging and seen any trading down that I'm really sensing at this stage Jim.", "James A. Buzzard - President", "Oh yeah I think that's right John, I think Claudia the... the area that gives us a little bit of pause right now, because we just don't have visibility is the back to school season, and as you know we played at a very high end of that market place and so you will have to watch how the consumer reacts to all the other things going on. But this point we don't see any impact on it and as John said in the packaging business, things are holding up well.", "Claudia Hueston - J.P. Morgan", "Okay and then referenced Asian competition, in release around the consumer and office product business. Is that on the high end stuff or is that still pretty much on the low end?", "James A. Buzzard - President", "Pretty much on the commodity side of things, I would say one of the things we are seeing as you know, we do source from, Asia... is we're impacted by, what our rising cost coming out of Asia for all products at this point of time so that's something that we're having to do with as well.", "Claudia Hueston - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, and then I'll was hoping to shifting gears a little bit looking at the consumer packaging business, can you just comment on your outlook for resins, in the face of the oil price movements? And then as we look to that business in the second quarter, should we expect some recoup as you pass through the price increase from last quarters as of sort of to get implemented?", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Claudia let me start and then I'll turn to Jim to provide a bit more definition around us. I think that with what we are seeing in a volatile oil price marketplace and volatile pretty much on the upside that we can only expect to see resin and other oil related or energy related materials continue to increase and price and we have a clear priority to ensure that those cost are off set by pricing improvement in our own market structures. As Mark indicated and I think Jim eluded, it is... there is no sure guarantee with the momentum we've seen in that cost input that we can perfectly offset in any given three months period but you can be sure that our absolute determination to off set those unexpected cost is a firm priority in the company. Jim.", "James A. Buzzard - President", "It's just don't have it, I think Claudia, we will see a resin increase in the quarter and as John said we are very focused on getting pricing to recover that, most of our business has contract passthroughs that we will get that. There is lag as John referenced it goes with that, and in other case is where we don't... we are going after general price increase to make sure we can recover it so, we will go after and get it, but that may be a little bit of lag as we go forward.", "Claudia Hueston - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, great. And than, just finally on that business, know I think we topped past quarter about may be getting 2 or 5% operating margin by the end of the year. Is that something your still comfortable with in this cost environment or do you think you may have a little bit more of a difficult time this year and might... given the passthroughs be more of '09 issue?", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "It is just through the first quarter, Claudia, and we are absolutely focused on the same objective we have talked about before, clearly the cost environment makes these things though but it in no that has diminish our focus on that is a key result.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll now go to the line of Mark Connelly with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Suisse", "John, just two questions. One, if we can start with consumer in office, I'm just wondering, where we're headed sort of strategically here. The brand is strong but the customers are shifting their... their buying patterns and I am just curious how you guys keep the upper hand in that relationship as the selling season is contracting. Obviously, it's been an issue you have been dealing, but I am just wondering are they shifting more of the risk to you and how do you fight back?", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Did you have a second one as well you want to come back to that?", "Mark Connelly - Credit Suisse", "Yeah, well the second question is actually even picture... with things being weaker out there and your balance sheet being in good shape, are you looking at this and saying this might be a good time to be picking up acquisitions to strengthen the global platform?", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Let me comment at a high level on both of those and then I'll turn to Jim to speak more definitively about what we are seeing in consumer and office, to give you a bit more color in those relationships. I think one of the key strengths in our position in this consumer and office marketplace over a long period of time other than the super group of individuals who have lead and operated that business is the power of the brand and I think we have been able to have that power brand... power resonate with consumers and that has given us a very firm position in what has been a shifting marketplace. There's no guarantee that there aren't going to be further squeezes as we go forward, but we see go power in that brand and that's enabled us to maintain share and good strong profitability and for us as a parent company good cash flow as well.", "With respect to the second question before turning the first back over to Jim, we do have a strong balance sheet and we do see that the times are a little bit soft. We do not however, view this at the time to be unduly opportunistic at least from the standpoint of being profligate. We want to be very sure that we are working prudently, that we are generating and maintaining good liquidity in a period that we frankly don't know where things are going to go, clearly we will, as I concluded my comments this morning, invest prudently for profitable growth in our global markets that will enable us to grow where we to need to grow and it think our balance sheet and our overall business profile enables us to do that but that won't be strategic, it will be select. It would be prudent and you can be sure that it will not be anything other than right sized, that that is we're going to be looking and tuck-in kinds of things and in some cases investments are just in how we do things I suppose looking into to... to make any major acquisitions at this stage.", "James A. Buzzard - President", "Just building on it Mark in might just going back to consumer office products, want to make sure I clarify that we have not yet seen any thing within consumers trading down, something we're obviously are watching closely. Its really too early back-to-school season to see that and the fact. The fact is we've got nine out of ten top brands in that and market place in many of the retailers we are to category captain, we manage full category for them. In fact they like our brands because they make more money that retail of our brands and they do of with more commodity oriented ones so, our retailers like it, we have a very, very strong position with our brands have had for many years. It's a business that drives on innovations, keeps things fresh and different. There is no question we are seeing it today our retailers are going to manage our inventory closely, but as the back-to-school season comes in that will press us to make sure we can service some and send in the replenishment orders. So we are still...we are still feeling good about to back- to-school season but obviously the cost is giving what we see in the in consumer environment.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Suisse", "Both were helpful, Thank you.", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Mark.", "Operator", "We'll now go to the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Hi, Thank you, maybe taking the flipside of Mark's questions, as you move closer to selling Charleston, are there any other kind of sizable divestment or things that don't appear core at this time?", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Gale, I think we have been to true to form in recent years in divesting businesses larger or smaller that don't necessarily fit our profile and we have been somewhat contrarian in the marketplace by not doing these things purely opportunistically but by ensuring that we're taking the time to maximize value and we continue to work through that process with respect to all assets that we presently hold.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Okay, and I think I saw somewhere in the press release a comment about landfills increasing this year, I was wondering if you could give a little bit of color in favor of what we should be expecting?", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah Gale, this is Mark. We do believe that we will see increased revenues from the sale of land compared to the prior year. It's a... while it's certainly a difficult market, we do have a very strong portfolio in great locations and the team has been very, very proactive in getting those properties ready, enhanced and they have a quite a quite a strong marketing program, so we do still expect to see increased land sales year-over-year.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Okay, and finally I thought I heard a mentioned of increased maintenance expense at Covington in the quarter, I was wondering if you could compare that to the cost that you had in the first quarter Mahrt?.", "James A. Buzzard - President", "It will certainly... Gail, it'll be less than what we had in the quarter at Mahrt.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Okay. Thank you.", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Gail.", "Operator", "Moving along to the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.", "George L. Staphos - Bank of America", "Hi guys good morning. How are you? First question, I thought I heard you say something about realigning the sales forces, I want to say in consumer solutions, but might have been in packaging resources, if I heard correctly could you give me a bit more detail in terms of what's involved and how long that process might go on for?", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "George, at a high level we have had a very, very successful effort selling to each of our major customers in the segments we have targeted, business-by-business, product line-by-product line and I think what we have seen as we have knit together very attractive packaging platform, but there is very good opportunity for us to move more logically to an approach where we are selling as a platform aligning our products with various solutions we have, as levels of interaction with our customers that will enable us to strategically support their needs a lot more affectively. So, what we are doing is gradually making shifts and we are starting as I commented in my openings remarks with healthcare and personal care to bring the breadth of our packaging platform to bear and that's what where... that what we are all about. It's a logical next step and it's something that we will be gravitating towards in the coming months.", "George L. Staphos - Bank of America", "Okay. And my experience with the sorts of realignments in the past is that while they ultimately work out and they are well intended, they are often pretty tricky to implement the first few quarters. I don't know if you agree with that or not but how do you manage against that and then specifically within a market like healthcare does your customer really care that you can offer the carton and offer this dispensing system? I would imagine that the performance and the pricing are separate but obviously there are some advantage there, what would you have us think about? Thanks.", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "George, great question. First of all, we're mindful that any kind of realignment, can involve some breakage of glass and you can be sure as they we are very focused on managing any realignment, we undertake with a view towards maximizing opportunity and minimizing disruption and so we are very focused on that, we would look at more of the half full approach to the glass that is we see more opportunity at this stage when we do disruption. With respect to the second question, whether its health care or other markets, I think what we have found is indeed, that our customer values strategic insights, the growing consumer insight and the breadth of the platform that we can collectively bring to there, so it is really more knowledge about them, their needs and our ability to serve it with that range of products and solutions, it is at the core of the value and so the customers do, appreciate, the breath that we have. And it's our job to continue to remind them of that, but that is, as any of these moves and talk to talk about these moves have... you can be sure, reinforced by interaction with the customers that have validated the re-alignment we are working towards.", "George L. Staphos - Bank of America", "John a couple of other ones and I will turn it over, is there any way and perhaps its in the detail in the appendix, I didn't see it too, breakout the fact that media is having on consumers solution and perhaps offsetting a better story, said differently, is there anyway that you can roughly quantify for us what type of revenue or EBIT growth you are getting out of the dispensing systems year-over-year, or over the last couple of quarters, that would be helpful if you had it.", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah let me offer a couple of qualitative comments and I will turn it over to Mark to supplement what I am saying. I think there is a very positive underlying story here, Gorge and its embedded in the comments that we've talked, but you'll see more of that as we move through the next several months, whether its clearly in personal care right now and our global markets, whether its an health care broadly or building or be it from a relatively small base and growth in the international beverage market. There are a lot of good things going on and I think in the... even in the dispenser market where resin price have masked results, the innovation, the technology advance and the growth and responsiveness to all of that in the market place is very, very positive, so we're incurred, we don't like the numbers fairly in the aggregate, but we like what is going on underlying all of that and we are encouraged by the opportunity we have to share with you in the months ahead, Mark.", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, and Gorge on your questions around media and Calmar on the media side revenues were down year-over-year but more moderate than we had seen in the past we... we are certainly having success in the gaming... gaming space the... and the fact is that absent that charge we took for the accounts receivable write off are of media business would have been up slightly year-over-year, driven mostly by taking out cost in productivity.", "In terms of Calmar that you know we are... we've talked about end market segments but if you look at Calmar holistically, that business continues to perform very well, sales for that business were up over 20% year-over-year so we continue to really like the growth side in profitability of that business.", "George L. Staphos - Bank of America", "Alright I'll turn it over and I'll try to come back later, thanks.", "Operator", "We'll now go to the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Thank you, just a few clarifications. First the pension that $30 million in the quarter, does that include... what's included in that or put another way, what is the pension credit for the full year going to be?", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Roughly, full year roughly $80 million included in the first quarter was a gain that we had as a result of pension curtailment, so it was a little bit higher than you would expect to see on a run-rate basis.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "So for is it going to be $17 million or so quarter going forward or what's the?", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, it's roughly 20 million a quarter and we had an additional 10 million this quarter for that curtailment gain.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Got it okay, and also can you give us an update on cap spending and I don't know if the sale that Charleston mill has any implications on that number, perhaps going lower. And then maybe DD&A, actually while your at it.", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure, the cap spend for the year is still in that 330 to 340 million range, there certainly is capital associated with the Charleston mill off course and that is before the exclusion of Charleston. So, there is certainly would be some decrease in that full year forecast related to Charleston.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Okay. And is too early to give us a sense as to what next year might look like of cap spend side?", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah it is.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Okay.", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We are working on continuing to really focus on capital spend, make sure that we have got very tight hurdle rates and good returning projects and as we see continued softness in the economy and potentially tougher times ahead, we are going to continue to look hard at our capital spends.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "So, certainly there is no major capital needs that are coming-up that's going to make that number necessarily go higher and unless you have great projects you want to be pursuing?", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Absolutely correct.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "And then lastly, on the land management, on... what... can you tell us how many acres you sold, what you sold them or whatever the best way to be looking at 8 million?", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, it's relatively minor in the first quarter. I'll have Jason get back to you and Mark with the details on that.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "And follow-up on that, with timberland values remaining extremely strong in fact seem to be continuing to go higher, are you constantly evaluating what another significant transaction firm from the land that you still own might make sense keeping a base for the development work that you are looking at but maybe supplement that with one or two larger timberland sales or are we kind of done with that process?", "James A. Buzzard - President", "Mark, I'll take that up. I think that we continue to evaluate opportunities as we look at markets and relative values and the land holdings to consider any and all such opportunities. I think it's fair to say though that as we talked following the conclusion of the last major transaction that that was the biggest single transaction in the past we had going forward, but again consistent with my comment to in response to Gail's question earlier, whether its hard assets or land assets like. We'll continue to evaluate what is the best approach to achieving value with assets that we have. You mentioned though the development activity and again, I think we're very encouraged as we commented during our prepared remarks with the progress that we are making and I would reinforce that the opportunity is there to create value within longer term prospective in mind and clearly, supporting that with the strong next stage focus on developing the final master plan for this East Edisto and following that entitlement is the key.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Thank you.", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Mark.", "Operator", "And we'll now go to the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Good morning. First a comment then a couple of questions. I just want to comment that I think that the value of Charleston was quite good. I know that that was a very good transaction for you but it's a good price and it really contrasts I think it what a lot of us saw at Stevenson a few year ago where we thought the mill was sold awful cheap. The questions I have are, first just on a detail basis, can you just talk with us a little bit about what the plan is down at Rigesa over the next two or three years. It seems like you're rebuilding an awful lot of the back end of that mill and you could be getting ready to do that machine that I think you've talked about.", "James A. Buzzard - President", "Mark, I'll pick up on that. You are correct and we are doing some work in the back end of that mill, more around however energy costs and what we have seen are dramatic increases in electrical cost down there, so it makes an awful lot of sense for s to go in and put it in the to capacity both from a power boiler and a turbo generator to make ourselves more self sufficient, and that was the driving factor behind those investments.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay. But it does look like kind of the infrastructure is getting built out to do make that mill potentially larger at some point.", "James A. Buzzard - President", "Well I think as we've talked in the past, we like Regisa a lot, the whole Latin American cost structure and, as we said, we've considered additional capacity down there. At this point in time, there is nothing on the table.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay. And then from a big picture standpoint, I know its about eight years ago when you kind of laid the strategy out to us which was the focus on these downstream packaging businesses really focus less energy and less capital on the back end of the business, and it seems to me, in the interim we have seen a very interesting transaction with Mead done. We've seen the value of the underlying land in the company go up tremendously. But if you just look at the value of a share in the company, it hasn't really done anything over that eight year period, and I just wonder if you just step back, are there any lessons we need to take from that or do we just need to give this more time?", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I guess I should answer that question, Mark. And I think that there's nobody more frustrated with the share value performance than yours truly here leading the company today. But we're absolutely confident that the transformation that we are on is one that is directed to achieving the value that... the increase in volume that we believe is appropriate for shareholders. I think if we look at performance of companies across this industry, it reinforces to us that the actions were undertaking while those are not yet generating the results that is manifesting share price that a course of action which would have been stay the traditional course is one that would not have generated the prospects we see going forward. So, we were going to keep our nose to the grindstone, we have confidence in what we are doing and we believe that our shareholders will be rewarded as a result.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Yeah, I guess John. I'd agree and I think staying the old course would not have been good decision. I just... do you think that there are any kind of modifications to the course that need to be made here in order to really generate more value?", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Mark, that's a fair question and you can be sure that as we look at the course and as we look at aspects to implementing plans along the course that we are relentless in challenging ourselves day in and in day out. And as we have any changes with respect to the course or modifications that we think are appropriate to discuss externally, we will do that. I would note just in terms of the comments we made in our remarks and the questions that George raised about go-to-market strategy that those are... those reflect very clear modifications to the course that on one hand, while subtle and not requiring a huge amount of hand fanfare and investment, are ones that reflect the logical next step in the execution of the commercial strategies that we have.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay and just as a kind of a final point on that. John, you are giving more detail on the company, on the business segments than we got a few year ago. I just want a particular insight, consumer solutions. Are there any ways that you can give us yet additional information to really help us understand what goes on within all of those different businesses on a sort of a regular basis? We get kind a segment commentary each quarter now but we have still don't head along in terms of numbers that we can look at there, that really help us understand those businesses.", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Mark I think that's a very fair question and we... I answer this knowing that there is probably never enough that we can provide that will satisfy all of your deals. But I think that as we go forward whether it is in a quantitative breakout or certainly qualitative information that we can support with numbers as appropriate, we will look to do that to build of the kinds of responses we gave in the questions today on what's happening with Calmar versus other forms of packaging. I think the other thing that we will do consistent with the market focus that we have talked about is that we will build into our commentary prospectively a greater measure of color as is appropriate on what we are seeing as our performance and progress and certain market segments, either healthcare market or a personal care market and we are appropriate the sub-segments there. So, you will get not only an assessment of what we are seeing in the subsets of the business but probably most important from our standpoint, which happening in the market place and how we are tracking there.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay, very good. Thanks.", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll now go to a line of Peter Ruschmeier with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Thanks. Good morning. I had a couple of questions, may be for Mark, I was curious if you could comment on the type of annual cash tax savings MeadWestvaco might enjoy if the Tree Act were passed?", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "In essence what that will end up doing is reducing the tax rate on those sales from the current 35% rate down to closer to 14%. Right now, our sales are modest but, you can merely just take some type of pro forma amount of land sales and multiply it by that delta in the tax rate.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And then coming back to consumer solutions, I mean I know there is certainly lot of challenges in that business. I was curious John if you could try to help us at a higher level to understand in different buckets perhaps, what has to happen to go from point A to point B, and we when we're think about it, if you were get to the high single digit, EBIT margins that you've talked about in the past, I think you're talking about $150 million kind of improvement that's needed, and the factors that impacted business are some out of your control, whether these... whether the economy resin cost pressures, secular trends that are out of your control... how much help do you need from those factors, and then the factors that are in your control, if there's any way to communicate the controllables that you can get X dollars from cost cuts or X dollars from mix or X dollars from new products? So just recognizing there's a lot of a headwind, I am just curious if you can help us to say here is where we are and here is some different pockets that we think that if we can get X, Y and Z, we can get to that objective?", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Fair question, Pete. I think clearly, as we comment at the earlier, we are very focused on the ambitions we have set for the year and clearly with this platform, moving well beyond 5% margins to higher single digit is absolutely the key. And as we go forward as I responded to Mark's question, we will attempt as appropriate to provide greater insight into those buckets so that we can have conversations with you about what those and entail.", "Cleary, there are as you have reinforced, unusual factors that represent headwinds today and we recognize it one form or another. In a challenging competitive global marketplace, there will always be things that we say as headwinds. And so, our plans and the conversations we'll have what you will focus on those things that we view our very much within our capacity to influence and you're going to have to measure our progress against those ambitions, but we'll look to be ever more clear in defining what those buckets if you will look like and want the performance expectation should be.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "And just may be a real high level, are the factors out of your control, are they going to impact this or do you think that you can get to your objective? Just trying the hard level say well, do you need $50 million or $75 million of help on these macro variables that are out of your control to get to your objective or do you think you can get there independent of that?", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think that... let me answer it this way. We would never make promises that headwind in the short-term making is going to make anything we are doing, easy. But I would go back to the comments where you've offered across the board and that is the growth in our markets the segments were targeting, the initiatives that we have, give us great confidence of the mix of business that we are looking to build in the segments we have targeted, will give us a significant opportunity to achieve the profitability targets and the profitable growth ambitions that we have set for ourselves, and we are absolutely determined surmount unusual headwind in the face of for example, energy related raw material cost with pricing that... if not immediately certainly through a stage pass through more than offset those costs so that the good work we are doing in the market places is not diluted by the raw material cost.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. That's helpful. You did give one example of something you are doing, I mean the Shelpak rollout, I am curious, is that a $10 million revenue opportunity, a $100 million revenue opportunity, I mean, any thoughts on as an example of a new rollout, if it goes well, how could... how much could that contribute for you?", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "That is a great question Pete and I would put that in one of those buckets that we'll talk about in the future. But surprised to say that it represents growth in itself as well as more broadly in terms of the healthcare initiatives, healthcare packaging initiatives we have, but one of several very, very exciting opportunities that we see for taking our leadership position in compliance base packaging at a time when there is great and increasing focus on to newer and higher levels of growth and profitability. So we'll come back and talk about that more fully at a later day, when we've got more specifics to disclose and we're in good alignment with customers and of more broad based the several customers' confidence in our disclosure of any of that information.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, that's helpful. I know we're running late but may be last one if I could. On the cost side equation, can you help us to better understand hedges that you may have in place, contracts you may have in place, whether its hedges in nat gas or longer duration contracts and things like coal so that we can better understand if and when the recent escalations may actually impact your business or whether you have protections from the recent escalations and some of your cost inputs?", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I'll pass you on to Mark.", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah Pete. Probably the biggest area for us is nat gas and we are hedged almost 70% going into the second quarter and 55% for the full year, and right now, those hedges are some where around 865, 870. So, as nat gas goes up, we should be fairly well covered.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Anything else outside of gas or coal for example?", "E. Mark Rajkowski - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No. We have contracts on coal that are longer term that we like right now and we... that's really it from a commodity perspective.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, very good. Thanks guys.", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks have a good one.", "Operator", "We have exhausted our time for questions today.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Rock-Tenn third quarter 2008 conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.

Thank you.", "Your speakers for today's call are Mr. John Spiegel, Vice President and Treasurer; Mr. Steven Voorhees, Chief Financial Officer and Mr. James Rubright, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.", "Mr. Spiegel, you may begin your conference.", "John Spiegel", "", "Thank you, Trey and a welcome to all for joining Rock-Tenn fiscal third quarter 2008 conference call. Joining me are Jim Rubright, CEO; and Steven Voorhees, CFO. During the course of the conference call, we may make statements that are not historical in nature and may involve forward looking statement, then the meeting of federal securities law.", "For example, statements regarding our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events for forward-looking statements which involved a number of risks and uncertainties. Many of which are beyond our control and that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed.", "Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties is contained in the documents that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents include the Company's Form 10-K filed for the year ended September 30, 2007, and the Form 10-Q filed for the quarters ended December 31, 2007 and March 31, 2008.", "During the call, we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are contained in the third quarter press release which is available on Rock-Tenn's website at Rock-Tenn.com.", "With that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Steve Voorhees.", "Steve Voorhees", "Thanks, John. During the June quarter, Rock-Tenn completed to close full quarter of operating results to Southern Container. Rock-Tenn's net sales from the June quarter $771 million, an increase of $180 million. Southern Container accounted for 156 million of the increase in sale. Rock-Tenn sales excluding the Southern Container increased 4% over the same quarter of last year. Rock-Tenn reported third quarter net income of $18.8 million or $0.49 per share. Rock-Tenn's suggested earnings were $0.70 per share, $0.06 or 9% more than the $0.64 per share reported in the third quarter of last year. Adjustments included $0.7 for the impact of the purchase accounting step up from the value of the seven containers inventory at the time of the acquisition.", "As you may recall from our prior conference call, (inaudible) requires a step up to the value of the inventory who require to a level that in the case of finish goods, approximate the selling price of the inventory (inaudible). As we saw this inventory, we assign the step up value of the profit sales minimal profit on these sales. We do not record the profit as we would have normally recorded this inventory, have been valued the cost.", "For cost, the step up produced income for the June quarter by $4 million or $0.07 after tax. We will not have similar charges from the seven container acquisition in future quarters. We recorded $3.7 million of restructuring cost consisting of acquisition integration cost of $1.7 million, and that amortization of acquisition-related deferred compensation expenses of $2.1 million.", "We will refer to the $2.1 million as ESU expenses during the conference call in April. During the quarter, we successfully completed the capital project of the Solvay mill to expand the capacity of the paper machine number two. The project reduced our income by $3.8 million primarily due to the loss of 12,500 tons of production during the outage.", "Finally, we incurred $1 million of operating losses at our folding carton plant in Chicopee, Massachusetts as I showed with the wind down of operations of that plant and the relocation of this business.", "Turning back to the consolidated results for the quartet, non-allocated expenses increased by $1.7 million to $6.9 million in the quarter. Most of the increase was for expenses related to the major of financial systems upgrade that we implemented this quarter. The cost to move to this new state-of-the-art financial system reduced income by 1 million in the quarter. The total project cost including capitalized expenses was approximately 7 million.", "At the time of the seven container acquisition, we fixed a portion of our bank debt for a period of four years at an average LIBOR rate of 3.11%. When interest rate increased, we terminated these fixed rate agreements and received $10.4 million in cash. We then entered into new fixed rate agreements for accountable time period at a higher average labral rate.", "The $10.4 million gain will be amortized over the original term of the fixed rate agreements. We currently have approximately 70% of our debt at fixed rates. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $22.5 million, below depreciation and amortization of $39.2 million.", "Our guidance for capital expenditures in fiscal year 2008 has been $90 million to $95 million, and for the fiscal year 2009, our guidance has been $80 million to $85 million. We expect actual capital expenditures for fiscal year 2008 to be at the lower end of that range, (inaudible) $90 million, and fiscal year 2009 capital expenditures to be in the range of $90 million to $95 million. This includes a $5 million increase for the spillover of capital from '08 to '09.", "We have identified a number of project that will drive synergies and enhance the seven containers integration that will require an additional $5 million that we have included in the past month. Rock-Tenn's net cash provided by operating activities was $107 million in the quarter as compared to $72 million in the prior year quarter. This strong cash flow enabled us to pay down $89 million in debt during the quarter. Total debt was 1.765 [ph] billion at the end of June.", "Our (inaudible) which deducts the cash on our balance sheet at the end of June was just under $1.7 billion. Rock-Tenn's full format credit agreement EBITDA for 12 months ending June 2008 was $440 million.", "Using the $440 million and our debt levels at the end of June, our credit agreement debt to EBITDA ratio as of the end of the quarter was 3.92 tons as compared to the 4.2 tons when we closed the acquisition in early March. And this compares to our cabinet of 5 tons. We continue to expect to reduce our debt to EBITDA ratio to 3 tons by September 2010.", "On January 15th, we announced a realignment of operating responsibilities. Our six coated paperboard mills now report to Michael Kiepura who has lead and will continue to lead our folding carton business.", "Our five special paperboard mills now reports to Dick Steve [ph] and will continue to have responsibility for Rock-Tenn's RTS partition joint venture with Sonoco. Rock-Tenn's reporting segments will change to reflect this realignment. Before we vie up to recording segments, we will include the following, consumer packaging consisting of folding carton investments and six coated paperboard mills specially paperboard products including five specially paperboard mills, 16 converting locations, and our recycled paperboard procurement in trading activities, corrugated packaging including the Solvay and St. Paul containerboard mills, and our corrugated converting operations.", "Fourth, our merchandizing displays business will continue to be reported as a segment. In September, we will report financial results along this realigned segments including three years of comparable financial information. General, James will now discuss our operating results in (inaudible).", "James Rubright", "Thank you, Steve. Strong sales performance in our consumer packaging display and corrugated packaging businesses and higher accretion to earnings from the Southern Container Acquisition prove this quarter's excellent results. Sales were up over the prior year 4.9% consumer packaging, 12% in display, and (inaudible) sales of corrugated packaging were up 16.5% all compared to the prior year.", "Although higher prices contributed to the increased sales, our volume in each of our converting business were up. And in the case of consumer packaging in corrugated packaging where we have published industry data, our sales increases outpaced flat folding carton industry sales at 2.1% decline in industry box plant sales.", "A higher sales contributed to the higher segment income in our consumer packaging business. Consumer packaging segment income was up 25.8% over the prior year and return on sales was 4.7%, which includes the business transition losses related to the closing of our Chicopee, Massachusetts plant which we took out in (inaudible).", "We achieved this result due to the benefits we have attained from our operating improvements and our sale gained. Corrugated packaging margins were up as well including our legacy business and the Acquired Southern Container operations, although I can't quantify precisely the increase for you as we do not report the GAAP segment income for Southern Container for this pre-acquisition quarter.", "Margins of our display business were down in quarter despite continued strong sales, as significantly higher input cost and sales mixed reduce margin. Return on sales of 9.8% for the quarter was disappointing as it was at the low end of our normal range but with still within the expected range for this business over time.", "Turning to our paper mills, our mills were great throughout the quarter with new records total production at our coated and especially milled. Tons shipped, almost 236,000 tons are up 11,000 tons from the prior year, and are up 7,000 tons from the second quarter of this year.", "Also to mention, sales increases in Southern Container box and graphics plant and containerboard mill's operating performance and superior cost position resulted in better than expected earnings accretion from the acquisition.", "If it excluded special items we sited above in establishing adjustment earnings which we think is the best way to represent the ongoing earnings of the acquisition without the acquisition relay of charges in the Solvay capacity expansion which I will discuss. The acquisition of Southern Container had a $0.21 per share to our adjusted earnings for the quarter.", "Our June 2008 expansion of the southern containerboard mill has exceeded our targeted capacity increase. And based on current production rates, the annual capacity of the mill is now 770,000 tons per year. Fully 50,000 tons more than we paid for and what we announced when we announced the acquisition in January of this year.", "As we expected, I think I have advised you with connection to this jut down, we believe we have the additional tons sold out primarily from the increase internal consumption that we have at Rock-Tenn and from integrating Rock-Tenn's purchases, as well as from improvement in our combined portfolio and trace walks [ph].", "Turning to the cost situation, much higher input cost particularly in our coated and specially milled reduced total statement income by 18.6 million or 31% per share over the prior year, and 6.4 million or $0.11 per share over Q2 '08. Specifically for the coated and specially milled, recycled fiber was up $21 per ton as Chicago OBM pricing averaged to $110 per ton in the quarter, and recycled fiber pricing increased $5 per ton over Q2 '08. Virgin fiber cost were also up $25 a ton over the prior year, and $17 per ton over Q2 '08.", "Natural gas and other purchased energy costs were up $18 per ton, because NYMEX natural gas pricing average $10.92 per MMBTU for the quarter, and increased $5 per ton over Q2 '08. ", "Transportation costs, which you know are very material cost for Rock-Tenn, were up $7 per ton, as diesel fuel prices were up 57% over the prior year according to the US Energy Administration. And they increased $5 per ton over Q2 '08, and US Energy Administration's increase for that quarter was 24% over the immediately preceding quarter.", "The chemical costs were also up $6 per ton over the prior year and $2 per ton over Q2 '08. Thus, we saw just a veritable storm of higher input cost across our business compared to both immediately preceding quarter and the year. And though we have realized price increases for coated and especially paper board during the quarter, the price increases were not enough to offset these cost input increases. However, as I will discuss in more detail, fiber and energy costs particularly have eased significantly from the averages we experienced in the just-completed June quarter.", "Also, as we noted in our press release, there are a number of factors that appear to go very well for continued earnings and cash flow increases for Rock-Tenn over the balance of this year, and in the fiscal 2009. I will detail the most important ones that we see.", "First, demand for paper board in consumer packaging remained solid, and our businesses have outperformed industry averages by gaining share and doing better with respect to price recovery of that our competitors.", "Demand for corrugated packaging actually strengthened materially in the last few weeks with backlogs and new projects showing healthy gains. Thus, we believe the demand outlook across Rock-Tenn is very good.", "Second, we have seen a number of recycled mill closures announced since our last conference call, which will remove overhanging capacity and keep industry operating rates up.", "A total of 635,000 tons per year of recycled capacity of all grades have been announced to close since we had our last call. Particularly significant to us is the announced indefinite, whatever that means, closure which is scheduled for late August of this year of 180,000 ton per year coated recycled mill in Canada, and then 343,000 tons of uncoated recycled box board capacity including a small but significant mill located in Chattanooga, in Tennessee, where we also have an uncoated mill that serves independent (inaudible) manufacturers.", "Third, recycled in virgin fiber cost and NYMEX natural gas pricing, our largest input cost together with transportation have all moved in our favor. For example, Chicago OBM pricing for OCC is now $90 per ton versus the June quarter average of $110 per ton. In Buffalo, OBM for OCC is also $13 per ton lower.", "We currently consume an average of 1.9 million tons of various grades of recycled fiber, of which OCC is approximately 75%. In our virgin paperboard and market pulp production based on current pricing for fiber, we would also expect fiber cost to ease by $6 or $7 a ton for this quarter versus the immediately preceding quarter on our 430,000 annual tons of production of bleach paperboard and market pulp. Natural gases also eased materially, as I'm sure you've noticed.", "The July actual natural gas price was $13.10 per MMbtu, but the August-September natural gas strip is approximately $9.20 per MMbtu, $3.00 less, and the annual natural gas and fuel oil equivalent purchases for us are about $9 million MMbtu per year, so again, a significant variance in cost.", "Fourth, we expect to realize much higher pricing for paperboard and converted products in the coming months particularly corrugated packaging.", "Since our last quarter call, published transaction pricing for containerboard is up $55 per ton. Our total containerboard capacity is 955,000 tons per year. Published transaction pricing for bleach paperboard is up $40 since our last analyst call. Our annual capacity for bleach paperboard is a little over 330,000 tons per year.", "The pricing outlook for 100,000 tons of bleached southern softwood craft pulp continues to look good. In addition to previous announcements related to these increases, we have announced additional price increases of $65 on bleached paperboard and $50 per ton on uncoated and coated recycled paperboard. Our total uncoated and coated recycled board capacity is 851,000 tons per year.", "We actually have some additional capacity on our Seven Hills joint venture with the gypsum pacing machine in our very small Aurora book board mill, but there \u2013 in Aurora, we only sell converted pricing, so paperboard pricing index is not relevant. And in Seven Hills, as you know, it is a total agreement effectively and affects three of those prices. And that's why the 851,000 tons is the number that I've used because those are the ones that we will select market pricing in our effective value increases.", "So, as we track through that, we would expect higher paperboard and containerboard pricing over the September and December quarters and then with our most recent announcements, we would expect continued recovery of higher pricing on coated and uncoated paperboard in the calendar 2009.", "Finally, as we discussed, in June 2008, we brought on additional capacity in our Solvay containerboard mill. This capacity adds 50,000 tons of production over the next 12 months. In addition, we are beginning to realize the synergies that we have forecast with the southern container acquisition, although as I've mentioned before, we are just beginning to bring those synergies on. So we really expect to increase the annual contribution from that acquisition by about $15 million as a result of those synergies.", "On the subject of synergies, we have begun executing our business integration plan within the last 30 days and as I discussed in connection with that, we are actually downward integrating the legacy Rock-Tenn operations into the larger and lower cost Southern Container operation.", "As a part of that integration, Southern Container will give up its historic identity in the marketplace and will go to market as Rock-Tenn. And we are going to be much more consistent with our other business units in eliminating a number of the trade names we've operated on because we believed we will benefit significantly from capitalizing on the brand equity for quality and service that is signified by the Rock-Tenn brand in the marketplace.", "In that connection, we freshened and modernized the look of our brand, which you may have noticed appearing at the head note of our earnings release.", "When we take the current environment of good demand, continued capacity rationalization and paperboard grades that are highly material to us, strengthening demand for containerboard and particularly corrugated packaging at our box plants, which I think is very important on the subject to passing through at the box plant level the published containerboard price increases together with our volume increases at the Solvay containerboard mill, we think this represents all in all a very positive outlook for Rock-Tenn.", "That concludes the prepared comments that Steve and I had. And at this time, we would open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator instructions) The first question does come from Claudia Hueston of JP Morgan. You may ask your question.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "Thanks very much, good morning.", "James Rubright", "Good morning Claudia.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "Did I hear you right that Southern was $0.21 to earnings in the quarter and then I just wondered if you could talk about how we should think about the accretion on an annualized basis, so are you comfortable with that as sort of a run rate?", "James Rubright", "Yes, I am. The mill does not take a prolonged annual outage as the Demopolis virgin mill does. It does take outages during the year, so you multiply 21 by 4. You might shave a couple cents of it for maintenance outages, but I think it is a run rate. When we announce that we were doing the shutdown to increase the capacity of the mill, we predicted about $0.05 of operating losses which is really lost production and expenses that you would otherwise have devoted to productive offer activities. And I think that if you're trying to go to the underlining earnings of the mill, you have to essentially treat that as a capital expense associated with the project and that's why we adjusted it out.", "So, yes, I think that's right, but it does not reflect the synergies because the business integration with respect to the reduction and staffing and associated business improvements from aligning our business with the Southern Container business model we just began in basically in July and August. And then as we've also discussed, the administrative synergies are awaiting a major system integration which we are in the process of designing. As Steve mentioned, we upgraded Rock-Tenn's financial systems materially in the last quarter and we had to do ours first before we could do theirs. So I don't think you are seeing significant synergies. We have integrated some purchases, but the substantial majority of the synergies are ahead and we have them identified and I feel very confident that we will be able to recognize them.", "In modeling our business, Claudia, they probably will not all show up in the containerboard segment because there will be an administrative component to those savings that will show up across Rock-Tenn. And we very likely will reallocate the home office in administrative costs. For purposes of this year, particularly because of the way the Southern Container employee compensation programs were established, we didn't change the allocation of cost to Southern Container. We held them steady from the administrative cost they would have incurred. And in fact that made sense because of the transition of the administrative assistance I referred to.", "So if we in fact change our allocations, what we will do is to make that clear. We will give an update and publish the report so that it will be out there and we will be glad to sit down and explain to you how we have modeled that, so then you'll be able to predict how this cost roll across the segment, but then it will be formalized before we are in a position to do that.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "Okay, thanks that's very helpful. And then just looking at the paperboard business, the bleach board and pulp volumes were a little bit lower than I had expected. Don't know if you have any caller on that, (inaudible) year-over-year?", "James Rubright", "We do, we report ship tons, not tons produced.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "Okay.", "James Rubright", "And so there can be noise in the shipment date, more than production. In fact, the mills run at essentially \u2013 the bleach board mill was sold out, so it really was a function of when the ton shipped, not when they were produced.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "Okay.", "Steve Voorhees", "In the coated mills, we took a few days of market downtime, but not anything that was really significant and I think that we will be cleaned up by the closure that we have referred to.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just finally, could you just give a little bit more color on the displaced business and sort of maybe parse out what was cost and what was maybe mix related and just a little bit more color on what the cost pressures are in that business?", "James Rubright", "", "Yes. Well, I think the majority of the difference in earnings was mix related and they are subject to a lot of the same production cost that are corrugated box plant would be subject to, because you've got the transportation costing cost (inaudible) cost and the like. They tend to pass through their cost pretty well and that's why I think that the majority the effect was mixed, as I have to look at it and review the sort of the detail under those numbers. But I kind of been to the point, if you are turning the dials up on Rock-Tenn's businesses, don't turn all of them up and then turn alliance up too.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "", "Okay.", "James Rubright", "That business turns to -- that is going to be a somewhat countercyclical business. So I think that you need to kind of take an average of a number of running quarters in order to really predict the annual run rate at alliance. It's a very competitive business. And as you know, we have a large competitor out there who's indicated that the business has maybe gotten a little tougher too. So, I think that, if I were modeling that business, I'd put it in something like an 11%, 11.5% return on sales. Try to make a guess with respect to sales going forward, but recognizing that if the economy picks up, probably you might see a little dialing back and customer utilization of this place. So I'd moderate that business somewhat.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "Okay great that's really helpful. Thanks so much guys.", "Operator", "Joshua Zaret of Longbow Research, you may ask your question.", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "Thank you. I guess, if I heard correctly on demand for corrugated packaging, I think you said it strengthened significantly in the last few weeks. I would just like to follow up on that because the June numbers were pretty bad, and so I'm wondering is that because of the unplanned schedule maintenance and it relates to you as a company, or just the industry?", "Steven Vorhees", "That is the right question to ask. What I was referring to was demand for corrugated packaging in our box plants and graphics plant. So our plant activity is up in our backlog were up. I think our backlogs for corrugated packaging were up about 7% over the last couple of weeks and our pipeline of new projects was healthy to us. So we are seeing good demand from our customers for finish goods. We are 2% of the industry and we're focus on the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Southeast. So it maybe a regional look, and it may be our companies look. I don't have visibility across the industry so I think -- for the answer to your question, I'd be listening very careful to the -- carefully to the others who announced, but I will tell you that we feel that demand has definitely strengthened.", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "Okay. As long as you bring up, I mean the regional thing, with Solvay, there are not a lot of containerboard mills up in the Northeast. So I'm kind of wondering, when you look out past 2010, your balance sheet is restored and you start looking to expansion. How important is that mill? Is there room for expansion there and would that be the first place you look within the company in terms of putting a new machine? How do you think about that now?", "Steven Vorhees", "I think, we think about all of the things that you've mentioned -- we were very attracted to the containerboard business based on what we viewed as a change in the fundamentals. That economic premise looks really good four months into it and we think there's opportunity there both through acquisitions and continue the Southern business model of successful expansion. There is room for another machine on the site in Syracuse so we will definitely evaluate that. ", "In our St. Paul site, we have the ability I think to significantly improve both the cost and the productive capacity on that site and we have great access to fiber and just a superb workforce in a community that recognizes the value of having that mill where it is. So, we are definitely going to look at the possibilities of doing something in that region. But the fact that you've noted which is if we have a locational advantage in New York State based on the scarcity of productive capacity there really translates into the strength of the swap position that we have through that mill and because of course it's new and makes a very high quality product that swaps.", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "Great. And one last set of questions, on the cost side or fiber cost being down so much, is that a function of weather, or is there something else going on there?", "Steven Vorhees", "No, it's a function of February. If you just model recycled fiber pricing over time, there is a February increase that is observable in most instances and it is the amelioration of the February price point.", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "Okay, that was for recycle, but what about now for virgin, is that a weather thing or --?", "Steven Vorhees", "No, I think that it is really a fuel oil related phenomenon. The cost pressures on truckers are the same cost pressures that are experiencing -- being experienced by the people who go into the woods and go get trees, where fuel oils and material costs, and the marginal producers there are under a lot of pressure.", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "Got you, that's very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Our next question does come from Christopher Chun of Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Yeah, thanks. Good morning Guys.", "James Rubright", "Hi, Chris.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "", "First of all, can you remind us how much pension expense will be for this fiscal year and how that compares to your cash funding?", "James Rubright", "Yes, Steve is referring to that right now.", "Steven Voorhees", "", "Approximately $5 million.", "James Rubright", "Pension expenses, $5 million.", "Steven Voorhees", "Yes.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "", "What about the cash funding?", "James Rubright", "Hold on a second.", "Steven Voorhees", "It is $5 million.", "James Rubright", "And what is pension funding, I thought it was \u2013 ", "Steven Voorhees", "It was $16 million, I'm not sure.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And how -- do you have a sense of how that it will look in '09?", "James Rubright", "", "I think it's going to go up a little bit, but it's not going to be material. The funding is going to go up probably closer to $20 million.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Okay.", "James Rubright", "Then the expense, Steve, do you have a forecast of expense?", "Steven Voorhees", "I think about 11.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Can you explain why the expense would go up somewhat?", "Steven Voorhees", "It is the investment results for this year, just have not been. They have been under the assumed right return that we have. (inaudible) they're going to be just little investment of financial markets have declined.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then in terms of all your input cost, Jim, you discussed a number of factors in terms of how they were quite high for last quarter, but they've moderated since then. If you put them all together, can you give us a sense of sort of -- I don't know, either an absolute number on a per ton basis or something of order of magnitude of how much they might have moderated continue to last quarter's average?", "James Rubright", "I can, but I have to add it all up. I went through it item by item in the call.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Right.", "James Rubright", "If you don't mind, just call us back after the call and we will add it up and we'll discuss through it.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Yeah, okay. And then how about on that pricing side? You have a couple of price hikes on paperboard grades out there. Can you talk about how you expect them to roll through this quarter and how much of a lag there will be into the coming quarters?", "James Rubright", "", "Sure, because of the anti-trust rules that apply to us, I can't really predict or talk about how we will execute. I can speak, however, from the extent to which our volumes have contractual limitations and so forth and then what the normal experience we've had regarding price increases from publication in DPW. The big one that we'll start with is the $55 increase on containerboard and in our corrugated packaging business, we are less restricted regarding price movement contractually than we are in folding carton business.", "In fact, fully two thirds of our business is unrestricted and so we have the ability to move that when the market moves and that should \u2013 we should expect if the market moves in August as we expect, two thirds of that business would be unrestricted which respect to our ability to move it. The remaining third begins to have either delays where you got a two to three month delay or in some cases the cap bottom provision where you might get 60% of an increase or 60% of a decrease. So, there's a third of the business on which you will either be partially delayed or you won't get the full amount of the increase, but you should see a very substantial realization of that $55 on the assumption and we're making that assumption that it does move through the marketplace relatively quickly.", " ", "Now, bleach board, the publication of that increase was basically 20 and 20 over the last couple of months and that will pass through the marketplace relatively rapidly on the open tons, but again you have somewhat of a greater exposure to contractual limitation there than you do on containerboard and corrugated packaging. But again, over the next three to six months, I think you'll see us recover fully what we'll recover and likely weighted towards the first three months. With respect to coated recycle board, there we would be contractually the most limited in terms of our recovery. So, typically, we have said that a price increase takes really three to nine months to move through our system with a normal distribution that probably has a peek about six months out.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank ", "", "Okay. And then what's the breakdown between open tons and contractual in waste and CRD?", "James Rubright", "", "I don't have that precisely, but I think at least 50% of our total tons on both grades would have some contractual provision that would specify a time period in which that increase would be recovered and that would have some delay.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "", "Okay. And then lastly if I might, Steve, you touched on this in your prepared comments, but I was wondering about you're debt and your infrastructure. Can you remind us, what's fixed and what's variable and if it's -- what the variable is high to and also how much of that comes from the Southern deal?", "Steven Voorhees", "We have about $1.7 billion in net debt. About $1 billion of that is due to the Southern transaction. The breakdown of fixed is we have public notes outstanding of $550 million, and then we have a term loan under our senior credit facility, which \u2013 that is what we have hedged, debt balance is currently $550 million. We took on $120 million some odd of debt unresolved that bound outstanding, those are fixed, and so that adds up to the fixed debt that we have, which is about --", "Jim Rubright", "70% of the total debt.", "Steven Voorhees", "Right. And the balance is primarily tied to LIBOR, the floating piece.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. So, LIBOR doesn't move around for you much, it's the interest expense that we saw in the quarter, a good run rate for the future?", "Steven Voorhees", "Yes.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thanks for your help guys.", "", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Our next question does come from Kevin Casey of Casey Capital. You may ask your question.", "Kevin Casey - Casey Capital", "I'm not sure if you guys talked about this, but have you talked about next year's CapEx and depreciation?", "", "James Rubright", "Hi Kevin, Steve did, but I'll just go over it briefly. We had basically said this year, the number was going to be 90 to 95. As we look at the timing of the expenditures, we think we are at the low end of that range because about $5 million is going to push into next year. Next year we had said 80 to 85, so we're up in that 85 to 90. And then we've identified some integration and synergy capital that we think is really highly justified and is part of out overall $15 million of annual synergy run rate and that looks like about $5 million for us. Some of it is systems related and some of it is related to plan closure and so forth. So we're saying 90 to 95 for 2009.", "Kevin Casey - Casey Capital", "And then can you talk about, now with the more \u2013 the bigger debt burden kind of buying back stock versus paying off debt?", "", "Jim Rubright", "Yes, and I didn't follow through on depreciation but depreciation is about $155 million. So you're going to see $60 million of difference between CapEx and depreciation. On our bias on buying back stock, we think that the optimal capital structure for us has between 2.5 to 3 times of debt to EBITDA. So, our target is to aggressively reduce debt to three times debt to EBITDA, and at that point, stick your head up and take a look at what you should do. Our belief is that we will \u2013 it will be appropriate for us to increase the dividend run rate and we are looking at that. The timing of that will be tied to continued reduction in debt, but the majority of the short term effects would be in the form of stock purchases where you have really good ability to dial up or dial down the amount that you do.", "", "Kevin Casey - Casey Capital", "Alright, thanks. Congratulations on another great acquisition.", "", "Jim Rubright", "Good, thank you, Kevin.", "Operator", "At this time, we show no further questions.", "", "Steven Voorhees", "Yes, thank you very much for your participation on this call.", "", "Operator", "Today's conference has ended.

This morning we announced our results before the market opened. The notification of this morning's call was broadly disclosed. Further, this morning's call is being webcast at mwv.com and slides that accompany this call are available there as well.", "I'll now briefly remind you that certain statements we make may be forward-looking and are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties described in our public filings. Furthermore, contents contain time-sensitive information that although correct today may change with the passage of time.", "Now here to tell you more about our results for the third quarter are John Luke, Chairman and CEO, Jim Buzzard, our President, and Mark Rajkowski, our CFO.", "I'll now turn the call over to John.", "John A. Luke, Jr. - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Jason thanks, and good morning to all of you. Let me begin this morning by stating the obvious. The crisis in financial markets and the economic difficulties that are emerging in its way have combined to post great challenges for all of us. While MWV is not immune to these challenges we are fully prepared to deal with them. Our company continues to deliver solid profitability, generate positive cash flow, and execute successfully on long term profitable growth strategies that will make us a more competitive global packaging leader and our global breadth strategic relationship with well capitalized customer and longstanding commitment at financial management are clear advantages in the phase of these tough conditions.", "We have been through difficult cycles in the past and we have confidence that our disciplined approach to generating sustainable value will enable us to emerge stronger from this challenging and uncertain environment.", "In the third quarter we increased sales by 8% across the company, and each of our businesses was profitable. However, continued rapid input cost inflation and weaker demand in our personnel care and North American consumer and office products businesses resulted in an overall decline in profitability compared to last year.", "We were also impacted during this quarter by the Hurricane along the Gulf Coast in September. We purely as a quarter-to-quarter measurement of our performance this result is disappointing, but it is not discouraging when viewed in the context of the broader challenges the world economy is now confronting. We have confident in the fundamental strength of our company and our global packaging markets, and in the strategies we are implementing the capture profitable growth opportunities we continue to see in those market throughout the world. For instance, the investments we have made to strengthen our global packaging platform helped us to deliver 19% growth in emerging markets during the quarter this global diversity in our business is a key advantage and what its clearly an uncertain time in the global economy. We expect continued progress in faster growing emerging markets from our new packaging clients in Wuxi, China, our expanded facility in Moscow and our joint venture with India based Vasco, a partnership that will allow us to extend some of our proven packaging designs and strategies from Brazil to India local fresh produce market.", "We also continue to benefit from our pipeline of innovative products. 12% of our sales in the quarter came from new products, a slightly faster phase in the first half of the year, and a number that will grow as we accelerate momentum with Shellpak, Natralock and other product pipelines.", "We have also made progress enhancing the value of our strategic land assets through the work of our community and land management business. Earnings in this business were followed, despite the credit crunch and softness in the real estate market. In fact, we found that the timing is proving to be ideal for us to accelerate our value creation strategy. We are taking advantage of the opportunity the fast track entitlement and enhance the value of our current holdings by swapping some parcel for more desirable track with features such as additional road frontage or existing entitlements.", "As we indicated recently, we believe these shareholders may benefit from a different ownership structure for this distinct business. We are actively working toward that end, so we are prepared to act on the right opportunity when market conditions permit.", "In addition to these ongoing strategic priorities, we have been taking additional steps over the past few months to position our company for success in these increasingly challenging times, and to strengthen our prospects for a long term growth when the global economy recovers. First, the immediate environment is clearly not business as usual. So we have been proactive about recovering rising input cost, conserving cash, controlling discretionary spending and enforcing even more disciplined approach to capital allocation. This is a natural extension of our conservative approach to financial management. Second, we continue to sharpen our focus on profitable growth in our market. MeadWestvaco has undertaken a major effort to align every aspect of our company toward one single goal, capturing profitable growth opportunities in each of our targeted markets. The focus that this brings will enhance our position with key customers that we believe will enable us to build and maintain even in the phase of a sustained contraction and consumer spending.", "Let me share with you a few other details. We are assembling all of our packaging commercial resources in the market focused teams, for healthcare, personal care, beverage food, tobacco and home and garden. Each of these commercial themes which we are calling strategic business units as SVUs is responsible for product development, marketing strategies, sales success and customer service. This represents an enhanced focus on the consumer and marketing insights required to develop the solutions our customer need and demand. These new commercial organization will simplify our relationships with customers, while also expanding their understanding of Oracle line of capabilities. By focusing in this way on our market we will be able to capture targeted opportunities in the packaging market segment that we have identified for substantial global growth over the long turn. This very focused the market based structure to our commercial activities will be supplemented by a stream moment and more cost effective and profitable operating model and Mark will share some of the details in a few moments. These strategies deeply focused on growth and profitability are right for any economic environment and we are moving aggressively to implement and execute. Through this period of economic uncertainly we will continue to be proactive in managing the elements of our business plan that we can directly control.", "Growth initiative, commercial success, price recovery and of course productivity improvements. We have confidence that our disciplined approach will continue to be an advantage for our company and will enable us to emerge as a strong competitor and an attractive investment. With this introduction, I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Buzzard and Mark Rajkowski to discuss our third quarter performance in greater details. Jim?", "James Buzzard \u2013 President", "Thank you John. In our businesses third quarter operating results reflect the continued impact of an usually high input cost and the first signs of weaker demand for some packaging products, as well as for back-to-school and time management products from our consumer and office product segment. We work to offset this external challenges during the quarter by extending progress on our profitable growth strategies, including another strong top line performance, good penetration of our pricing increases and improved productivity. Continued success in these areas will be an essential part of doing business in this difficult economic environment. We incurred a device by positive sales momentum in many of our markets especially in fast growing regions around the world. Sales outside North America again outpaced our overall growth rate with particularly strong results in emerging markets which grew nearly 20%. While the impact of a global slowdown is rippling to these otherwise fast growing economies we still believe they are poised for long term economic expansion, that\u2019s why each of our businesses continues to look for opportunities to participate in these emerging markets, as a sound strategy in the phase of sustained economic weakness.", "I will now discuss specific segment result for the third quarter, including some of the operating highlights and market performance in each business. You will find additional information for all of our business segments in the slide presentation that the company is called. In the packaging resources segment overall shipments increased compared to last year with a particularly strong performance for our bleached paperboard. Along with steady price increases this additional volume help drive sales up more than 11% compared to last year. Again this quarter however, input cost inflation outpaced our progress in the top line and our productivity was negatively impacted by the two large dorms that hit New York Evadale mill in September.", "We had a strong quarter for our bleached board product, gaining market share with our largest customer for a subject liquid packaging, increasing volume in tobacco markets outside the United States and generating significant momentum for our Tango Advantage product for the commercial marketplace. This total is not as part of the Coated Natural Kraft. CNK paperboard volume who are down compared to last years record third quarter.", "We continued a solid sales base for our corrugated replacement for glass bottle multi packs, but this was not enough to offset the decline in demand toward the end of the quarter for carbonated soft drink packaging in North America.", "Compared to the prior year backlogs at the moment are stronger for Bleached paperboard and about the same for CNK. Profitability for the PRG segment continues to be hit hard by input cost inflation which set another record in the third quarter. Performed well again in the third quarter despite a continued decline for the Brazilian rail and the same inflationary pressures and input costs. Strong volume growth for corrugated packaging helped improved earnings modestly compared to last year.", "In the consumer solution segment sales increased by 7% overall with strong commercial performance in our beverage, healthcare and home and garden packaging businesses around the world. This segment delivered another quarter of productivity as we continue to consolidate our footprint and improve asset utilization in our converting operations. Again, despite these gains profitability for the consumer solution segment was off by $12 million, equal to the additional input cost in the quarter for energy, freight and raw materials, primarily plastic resin and paperboard.", "Let me talk in more detail about what we are seeing in each of the CSG lines of business. For the quarter our global food and beverage business grew sales by 7%, we had broadbased success in our markets around the world with sales up in Asia, Europe and North America. Earnings in this business also showed a modest improvement compared to last year.", "We had an excellent customer retention rates in operating performance with the asset we acquired from Oracle packaging this new business helped new sales in North America even as we began the impact of declining carbonated beverage demand in the United States.  In Europe and Asia we had high carton volumes with Redbow, Guinness, Asahi and Fosters, as well as growth in our dairy business, and we continue to add business for Anheuser-Busch as part of our initiative to convert large multi plastic glass bottles and corrugated packaging to CNK paperboard solution. The media business continue to see decline for printed packaging for music, but generated solid increasing orders e for plastic packaging for DVD's and Videogames, including our board exclusion for the new Blu-Ray DVD format.  We have seen steady sequential volume growth Blu-Ray packaging every quarter since we launched this product.", "Overall, sales and earnings in this business were about the same as last year. Sales and profits declined in our global personal period business compared to last year. Volumes of declined is customers delay in new product launches and adjust inventory levels in anticipation of slower retail sales.", "Product mix was also impacted as some customers chose standard packaging over specialty solutions to offset their cost pressures. Also in the quarter we recorded expenses related to production consolidation activities in North America and Eastern Europe.", "In our healthcare business sales were up almost 25% including the contribution from our recent acquisition of international Labs.  International Labs are joint venture package fulfillment center with India-based Bilcare is a key element to helps streamline the supply chain for generic and branded prescription drugs using Shellpak. Our priority Shellpak solution continues to gain strong market acceptance at Wal-Mart and other prescription retailers.", "In our home and garden business we also delivered solid double digit sales growth, including market share gains with Clorox and strong organic growth through our strategic partnership with Scotts and SC Johnson. In the case of SC Johnson we are a key partner in the global expansion including serving their needs in Asia from the new Wuxi facility we opened last year.", "We also recently purchased some strategic assets and intellectual property from the bankrupt pump and dispenser competitor.  This acquisition further solidifies our leadership position in the home and garden market in North America. Some of the new business we have won with Clorox this year came from this competitor and the acquisition will provide an additional growth platform for us in this market. This is a good example of how we are continuing to leverage our financial strength to pickup high quality assets and customers from distressed competitors.", "Turning to our non-packaging businesses, result for the consumer office product segment were h behind last years third quarter.  In this area of our business, we have begun to see some direct impact from reduced consumers spending and the weaker US economy, as volumes declined in third quarter especially in North America.", "As you may remember we had strong back-to-school selling during the second quarter.  However, slower retail sell through rates translated in the fewer replenishment orders for us in the third quarter.", "In addition, the economic uncertainty has contributed to lower shipments of time management products for UN sales, as well as weaker sells in our envelope business. Offsetting this declines the business recorded productivity gains and product mix improvements, as well as the strong performance by the segment Brazilian business Tilibra as we entered the start of the back-to-school season in that country.", "In our specialty chemical segment the story is similar to last quarter with solid sales growth including strong pricing improvement offsetting rapid input cost inflation. Profitability in the segment was the same as the third quarter of last year even now we had some significant descriptions to our production schedule and supply chain due to the Hurricane.", "Demand is strong around the world for our performance chemical products especially for pine chemicals for the oil field markets and our asphalt trading business. We also continue to invest projects for Evotherm warm paving technology in several regions including China where he has gained high level government support as a sustainable solution.", "Carbon technology markets were strong outside North America, where opportunities during the quarter to gain share automotive market in Europe, Japan and South Korea helped to offset continue declines in the US automotive industry.", "In addition, demand remade relatively strong for water and food purification application for the first time this quarter we are reporting result from our Community Development And Land Management business as a separate segment.  We continue to make rapid progress with the value creation strategies we pursued over the past several quarters, and we are currently marketing more than 100,000 acres of real land.", "Land sales in the third quarter were $12 million, double last year's level, but below the $24 million we recorded in the second quarter. As you would expect the uncertain economy and volatile capital markets had an impact on a real crack sales during the third quarter. We sold roughly 4,600 acres for an average price per acre of over $2500.  This is a slight decline from our historic levels, because we intentionally held back sales of some higher value land in South Carolina due to unfavorable market conditions.", "To the first nine months of the year we sold 14,000 acres as part of our real track program.  Our strategy clearly continues to generate good per acre values which is our main goal, maximum net present value per acre.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss some our financial metrics for the third quarter. Mark?", "Mark Rajkowski \u2013 Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Jim.  Before reviewing the results for the quarter, I want to first talk about some of the operating leverage that we are managing to strengthen the company during this difficult economic period. Given the uncertain state of financial markets preserving our strong cash position is one of the most important near term priorities. We are taking proactive steps to further solidify this areas strength.", "As you would expect, we have stopped all non critical capital projects, we are aggressively managing working capital and we are controlling all spending that is not essential to making we are selling products.", "Taking together, these measures are expected to help insure that we closed 2008 with positive free cash flow which we defined as cash after capital expenditures and dividends. We are confident that our financial position and the additional action that we are taking to further to be a distinct competitive advantage for our company.", "In addition to these measures, John mentioned the plans we are implementing to enhance our commercial effectiveness and simplify our operating model. These efforts are focused on the following areas. First, we are taking a comprehensive look at the profitability of each element in our packaging business.  So we will use this information to streamline our product mix and portfolio and focus our investments and innovation.", "Second, we are evaluating the profitability and productivity of each facility in our manufacturing platform in North America and Europe. This is a natural extension of the productivity and asset optimization efforts that we have been implementing over the past or so but with an even more aggressive approached to operating efficiency and internal capacity requirements.", "Third, we are putting in place resize global finance, human resources and IT functions, organizing and staffing these groups on a global basis for the first time.  This work will enable us to leverage and extend the benefits that we\u2019ve gained from our shared services platform in North America.", "Finally, we are working to generate greater procurement related savings and supply chain efficiencies across all businesses.  By truly leveraging our global scale and scope we believe we can realize significant additional cost segments. We are currently finalizing these plans and will provide additional details on our next call.", "Now turning to results for the third quarter. The headline is that the true underlying progress that we made in the marketplace including gains in several businesses was massed by a number of challenging factors the most significant of which was hiring for cost.", "Energy materials and freight combined were $81 million above year ago levels and overall cost inflation grows by more than 10%. While the price of oil has permitted recently, the average price during the third quarter was about a $120 a barrel. 60% higher than the year ago quarter.", "In addition, we began to fill the impact of the sudden and substantial appreciation of the US dollar especially against the Brazilian Real which also had an impact on our bottom-line results.  To counter and overcome these factors we continue to have success driving price and mix and productivity improvements.  As we review the third quarter numbers, keep in mind that we have restated prior year results to reflect continuing operations on an apples-to-apples basis with the results in the Charleston kraft mill excluded and separately reported as discontinued operations.", "Starting with the top line.  Overall sales growth was 8% year-over-year.  Volume contribution is 1%.  Pricing mix was 4% and foreign exchange benefit was 3%.  Volume growth in the packaging resources and consumer solutions segments and continued strong price and mix improvement in the packaging resources and specialty chemicals businesses drove the top line improvement.  Overall demand for our products and solutions was relatively stable, which reinforces our key advantage in terms of in-market and geographic diversity.", "Though we saw weakness in the personal care market, our beverage, home and garden and healthcare packaging businesses delivered solid gains compared to last year.  Paperboard exports also remained healthy in the quarter and were driven by continued demand in tobacco, aseptic and the general packaging markets.  Specialty Chemicals business continued to deliver double-digit sales growth outside North America, helped offset to continued weakness in its US automotive carbon business.", "Our gross profit in the quarter, adjusted for restructuring and one-time items was $321 million, or about 18% of sales.  We have shown a 90 basis point decline compared to the year ago quarter was driven by higher input costs and our lower than expected productivity due to the Gulf storms.  Price and mix improvements across all of our businesses partially offset the impact of higher input costs.", "SG&A cost during the quarter continued to trend downward.  Adjusted SG&A excluding restructuring charges was $211 million in the quarter, unchanged on an absolute basis, but down 90 basis points to 11.7% as a percentage of sales.  The main driver of the improvement was productivity gains and lower corporate spend more than offsetting increases due to inflation and foreign currency exchange.", "Turning to the balance sheet.  Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the third quarter were approximately $520 million and benefited from the sale of the kraft paperboard division and from cash generated by operating activities in the third quarter.  Cash generated from continuing operations in the third quarter was $39 million compared to $172 million in the third quarter of 2007.  The year-over-year decline in cash flow was principally driven by lower earnings and by one-time tax items totaling $65 million.  Overall working capital efficiency ratios have shown substantial improvement with total working capital reductions of almost five days compared to the prior year.", "In addition to our strong cash position, we have no short-term debt or significant maturities due until 2012, and our committed $750 million credit facility and our $200 million account receivable securitization program remain undrawn.", "For now let me turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter.  Mindful of the limited visibility to the backdrop \u2013 due to the backdrop of a weakening global economy and unsettled credit markets, I will share with you what we currently see across each of our businesses.  Before trusting the individual businesses, keep in mind that our current exchange rates, we do expect to see a reduction in the company\u2019s earnings year-over-year due to the translation effects from the strengthening of the US dollar.", "Now starting with the mill businesses.  Demand for key bleached paperboard products remain stable.  Backlogs are at or above historical seasonal levels.  However, we are beginning to see some weakening in the backlogs for coated natural kraft.  In terms of input cost, we are beginning to see moderation in freight and energy cost.  However, prices for other key raw materials remain at historical high levels.", "In the consumer solutions business, demand in our key end markets appears to be holding steady at the levels we saw exiting the third quarter while input costs remain high, we do expect some benefit from lower plastic resin cost.", "In the consumer and office products business, we are seeing lower consumer spending in business purchases primarily for time management products.  We expect continued solid demand in performance in Brazil partially offset to weakness in North America.", "In the specialty chemicals business, we expect solid demand in performance chemicals to be partially offset by further weakening in the automotive carbon business.  The segment continues to focus on price and mix improvement to offset higher raw materials and freight costs.", "In this difficult environment we remain intensively focused on what we can directly control, including generating and preserving cash, driving price and mix improvement and taking our cost to our productivity initiatives.  Our progress in these areas will continue to ensure that our financial strength is competitive advantage for our company and our shareholders.", "John back to you.", "John A. Luke Jr., - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Mark thanks. At MeadWestvaco we have confident that we are doing the right things to strengthen our company's performance and succeed in this difficult economic and operating environment.  Our business is a profitable, our financial position is strong, and we are focused on making continuing progress in our markets and delivering results to the bottom line.  We are prepared to manage through this period of economic and financial tumult, and have confident that our global breadth and disciplined approach to generating sustainable value will enable us to a merge as an even stronger competitor.", "This concludes our prepared remarks this morning, we will now be happy to turn to those on the call for any questions you may have.", "Questions-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Great.  Thank you very much.  (Operator Instructions).  And our first question this morning goes to the line of - I should say rather comes from the line of Mark Connelly with Credit Suisse.  Please go ahead.", "Mark Connelly", "Thank you.  Two questions, I mean when I look at these results, I can't help but think that it\u2019s the traditional paperboard business that are doing well, even though historically input cost pressure has historically hit those business harder.  So is there something fundamentally changed about the consumer solutions business making it harder to pass those through, vis-\u00e0-vis your paperboard business where you don\u2019t seemed to be having anywhere near the trouble?", "John Luke", "Yeah Mark, its John.  You said there are two questions?", "Mark Connelly", "Yeah, I am sorry.  Yeah, the second question is on consumer and office with the changes in distribution channels.  I am curious, last quarter you said that the shift towards the box retailers was playing to some of your strengths and I am curious whether that\u2019s still feels true this quarter?", "John Luke", "Okay, let me pick up the first and I will turn to Jim to supplement as well as comment on the second.  First, we are holding up with great discipline in the traditional paperboard business as you called them.  But I would remind you that with the focus we have on our targeted markets that whether which were to characterize the traditional paperboard businesses or the downstream consumer solutions business now to include Calmar that we are focused on segment that we see good opportunity in which to grow and clearly we have had good success in aligning the paperboard business around those markets building on what we have done traditionally in the beverage and tobacco market.  And that\u2019s giving us good strength based on the performance in the quality leadership we have to hold our pricing and in many cases good premium pricing in those market.  You are right, some of the downstream consumer solutions businesses tend to be a bit more competitive in certain areas and that\u2019s particularly true in North America, I would say that we had a much better job generating price improvement and stability in other markets around the world.  But we have good confidence that we can succeed with that, it just takes a little bit longer in certain cases to get some of these pricing move through. And of course in this quarter we each reference we have had some pressures that you have now seen reenforced with some of the third quarter headlines from larger personal care companies that those markets have been unusually weak. Jim?", "James Buzzard", "Thanks John, I would only supplement those comments with one around our plastics business which certainly in Q3 we saw a very dramatic increase in resin prices. Most of our contracts with our key customers there are reopen on a quarterly basis some semiannual. So we will begin to move up on those prices in Q4 and see the benefit of that. In respect to your question on consumer office product, I think the same will institute that we commented on Q2. Certainly we are seeing strength in mass with important partners like Wal-Mart and target and we are seeing weakness in the office superstores all three being down as well as with our drug partners retailers as well. So that shift is continued on and that we expected to continue for the fourth quarter.", "Mark Connelly", "Good.", "Operator", "Great thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Claudia Hueston with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Claudia Hueston", "Thanks very much, good morning.", "James Buzzard", "Good morning Claudia.", "John Luke", "Good morning Claudia.", "Claudia Hueston", "", "I don\u2019t think you mentioned the outlook for the land business Mark when you are going through outlook, I know visibility is limited there. But can you just have any comment on how we should think about that business in the fourth quarter?", "Mark Rajkowski", "Claudia I didn\u2019t and one of the reasons is it is very lumpy as we talked about in at the end of the second quarter as well. So that hasn\u2019t changed. We have seen some of the pressures there and intensify it is very transaction oriented and to make a forecast at this time would really be baseless.", "John Luke", "Yeah, and I would just supplement that Claudia by saying, and I think we are in very strong position obviously we would like to be able to make that business less lumpy as Mark suggest. But I think we want to be very focused on generating shareholder value with any transaction we would consider below basis value we have in that land puts us totally in a very different class and others we have seen who are acting for more a distressed buyers in past year in todays stretched credit markets and we certainly don\u2019t profess to have any luxuries here, elsewhere we can pick the size and timing of the transaction as it make sense for our shareholders and that\u2019s what we are looking to do.", "Claudia Hueston", "", "Okay, thanks. And then just two questions on the packaging resources business, I was just wondering if you could maybe comment on your non-US businesses and if you are seeing any sort of signs of the slowdown in those businesses in packaging resources and then just any changes in the export market at this points, and if its possible to quantify the impact of the Hurricane in the quarter that would be helpful as well?", "John Luke", "Let me start by commenting on the global environment and I will turn to my colleagues on the Hurricane Claudia. I think its clear in the headlines that we are seeing everyday that this financial crisis and the result in economic turmoil is spreading, has spread all the way around the world. It is inevitable that it will impact consumer spending habits in various countries. We are seeing on the margin some of that occurring I don\u2019t know that we have felt the impact that we might just remove in the 2009 subject policies that are put in place to address softness in credit availability in certain countries around the world, but I would there say while we have confident that we are focused on the right consumer market and we are focused with good breadth on the geographies that we have targeted with excellent competitive position and also working I would reinforce with great customer that there will be presumably a bit more softening in certain of those market we saw in the third quarter and we are fully prepared to deal with that as it comes along. But at this stage of the game it has been only on the margin and we \u2013 so we will stay tune.", "Claudia Hueston", "Okay thank you.", "James Buzzard", "Claudia, this is Jim. In response to your question in the hurricane you can take sort of the plus or minus $8 million for the quarter was the impact.", "Claudia Hueston", "Okay, and that was pretty much, is that that just for the packaging business. So does that include the chemicals?", "James Buzzard", "That would include the chemicals business as well.", "Claudia Hueston", "Okay.  Thank you very much.", "John Luke", "Claudia, I would just and since I have got the line, I will just supplement my response also by saying, building on where I was commenting, I think we have got uniquely strong competitive positions in the global market.  The dollar well it is stronger, is still very favorable to our overall exports and we would expect as business exits in those markets to be preferred supplier for packaging materials given the targeted focus we have on certain customers end markets.", "Claudia Hueston", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thanks.  And we have a question then from the line of the George Staphos with Banc of America Securities.  Please go ahead.", "George Staphos", "Thanks.  Hi, everyone.  Good morning.  I just want to come back to the export questions, John, I mean realizing that bleached board is little bit of a different animal, and should be less susceptible perhaps to trade flow fluctuations because of the dollar.  And if we go back over the last five or six years, you have seen you know, roughly speaking about 500,000 tons moved into export from North America or growth in export, how much do you think could we repatriated back over the next two to three years or seemingly hold current currency rates where they are right now?", "John Luke", "George we have for the most part and I can't quantify this right now, but let me answer qualitatively, we have worked very hard to build positions that are based on quality performance and sustainability as our customers have grown in the world markets, resisting the temptation which always exits when you may have what is proven already to be an artificially week currency to build purely spot positioned.  So while I would never say that any of that tonnage would not come back, I can say with confident that it would be our expectation that the lion share of the market positions we have build around the world are sustainable positioned based upon the market position we have established.", "Mark Rajkowski", "George and building on that I think to your point SPS is a little bit of a different animal, and these consumer good companies are selecting that product line as a statement about their brand.  And so they are looking for premium packaging in developing markets around the world and we think that will continue to carry us away the boards.  Certainly we will feel as John said on the margin some pressure around that run the currency, but this is about TST companies building their brands through packaging and using our board to do so.", "George Staphos", "Okay.  So we should really do then Jim is look at income rates around the world, especially in these emerging markets given the strong correlation areas between income and packaging demand and should that decline - that\u2019s probably a bigger affect on your production and exports of bleach then would be the dollar, would that be correct?", "James Buzzard", "Yeah, I would just say George, I think that is exactly right and that is another dimension of the point.  Where to point, I should have made in answering Claudia's question, because I think that's it in a nutshell.", "George Staphos", "John, you mentioned the new business model and forming the new commercial teams around commercial development, it sounds very logical, perhaps natural lock within medical would be an example or pharmaceutical be an example of how that\u2019s playing out.  Given the other examples of how new model is actually leading to you capturing targeted opportunities as you said within your targeted market?", "John Luke", "Shellpak, in our healthcare business as we have commented is an excellent example of where we have been able to take a plastic package building on our knowledge in the paperboard market and our success within adherence or compliance packaging, understand through a much more focused appreciation of consumer trends, consumer needs, trends in healthcare overall as well as trends in retail, particularly at Wal-Mart.  Not to mention trends in sourcing of medical goods, pharmaceutical products we have understood that market much more clearly seeing the opportunities much more clearly and be in a position to bring packaging and related solutions to bear to establish when we firmly believe will be excellent long-term growth profitable positions.", "George Staphos", "Yeah, Sorry, I mean for Shellpak, but are there any other examples that you can point one is that the best one right now?", "John Luke", "Well I think what we have done over the longer with beverage packaging  is an excellent example as well. That is the market that clearly right now is feeling some signs of early softness, but the machinery linkage, the converting linkage and the excellent job we have done in the paper mill over a time has given us a very, very good focus. Another that I would point to is one that I referenced in a very small way during my opening comments that we are enthused about is the opportunity through our brand-new joint venture with Watco in India to bring great success based on what we have learned and accomplished at Rigesa in the agricultural markets in northeastern Brazil to India where there is a crying need for efficient packing to prevent produce, minimize spoilage, maintain freshness on the way to market.  So there are number of things that we can point to over time but I think we are learning an awful lot of about these markets from our customers, from our insight work and that's helping us ensure that our go-to-market strategies are ever keener in focus, that our innovation supports that, and that we understand much more lucidly the profit pools that exist in each market as well.", "George Staphos", "All right.  Thanks, John.  Just quickly and I will turn it over.  Office products, did you say in your guidance that we should expect an up quarter as Rigesa more than offsets the weakness in the US business purchases or it will be down and Rigesa is only a partial offset.  Thanks.", "John Luke", "Yeah, George.  We expect it to be down, but partially offset by ", "George Staphos", "Got it.", "John Luke", "Improved Brazilian performance.", "George Staphos", "Alright.  Thanks Mark.", "Operator", "Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.  Please go ahead.", "Gail Glazerman", "History good morning.  Just going back to consumer solutions and you talk about reopening some contracts over the next few months.  Do you have any concerns that falling resin costs will make a -- price also make it harder to see any recovery there?  Or is it relatively automatic where you will get it on a historic basis?", "John Luke", "It is relatively automatic.  As we absorb it on the upside we expect to retain it on the downside.", "Gail Glazerman", "Okay.  In terms of pricing.  If I recall correctly, some give some portion of your SBS business has been hasn't participated in the price recovery we have seen this year.  I was wondering can you give us a sense how many of those contracts percentage wise roll off in the turn of the year where you may be able to see greater recovery?", "John Luke", "Gail let me comment on this.  I don't have we -- I don't have the numbers right in front of me but you are correct that has been traditional posture.  We do have contracts that have been rolling off, but I think as we have indicated in previous calls and certainly in conferences, we have been proactive given the unusual cost increases that we have seen in working with customers to reopen or accelerate revisitation of those contracts, and I would say that we have had very, very good success not all of the impact that those discussions as reflected in our results to date, but it will be forthcoming.  So we are not waiting for any contracts to unwind at this stage.", "Gail Glazerman", "Okay.  And then just final question.  Mark, can you talk a little bit about pension?  I know it is early, but just any sense of what could happen moving into 2009 given market performance lately?", "Mark Rajkowski", "Gail we remain in a very strong position with our pension plan, and while certainly the markets and returns have been awful in general, we have a -- a very fairly conservative mix in terms of our asset allocation.  Which we had actually adjusted prior to some of the market declines we have recently experienced.  So we are still well overfunded and in a very strong position.", "Gail Glazerman", "Okay.  Thank you.", "Operator", "Thanks.  And our next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.  Please go ahead.", "Mark Weintraub", "Thank you.  One quick question.  Maybe there is a simple answer or maybe I am missing something.  Book value seems to have gone down -- or equity seemed to have gone down by a couple hundred million dollars.  Was that currency or what was causing the decline in shareholder equity? The other market?", "John Luke", "", "Yeah that was our currency translation.", "Mark Weintraub", "Can you just provide a little bit more color?", "John Luke", "Yeah, it\u2019s really a function of and Brazil was probably the biggest contributor where we had a - I think moving downward in the real in the third quarter.  So we have to translate our net assets to the current market rate.  And as those currency values decline, whether it\u2019s a real or the euro that impact on that assets gets reflected in currency translation account.", "Mark Weintraub", "And would it be possible for you to provide a framework for how we should think through your sensitivity to some of the energy cost inputs?  All in all, natural gas and I guess natural gas for you is one just \u2013 I mean, how much do you consume a year for natural gas, but also you do have a lot of sensitivity some other energy resources, and just a framework to help us think that through?", "John Luke", "Let me spend in terms of energy, it\u2019s roughly $100 million this quarter in terms of total energy spend.  Natural gas is the biggest piece of that, 40% of our spend.  The next biggest component is electricity and coal and wood waste.  So in terms of how we think about that, natural gas being the biggest component, we do hedge our natural gas purchases to remove the volatility of cash flows and at this point in time as we look out next year, we are about 60% hedged.  So as market crisis rise, we are a little bit under water as - we are a little bit in the money as they fall, we are a little bit under water.  But as you think about that, roughly $100 million a quarter spend, 40% oil and gas then electricity, oil and wood waste are the key components.", "Mark Weintraub", "Would it be feasible for us to - if prices, if energy prices were to stay basically where they are today, what would your that 100 million be on a quarterly basis on average in 2009.  And then if you would take out the hedges from that equation is that something that you would have off the cuff?", "John Luke", "No, and that\u2019s a - that would probably take me a few weeks to figure out, Mark.  We could work through those details offline, but I think the way to think about our energy spend is that year-over-year in the third quarter was up almost 20%, okay.  And that was driven by higher oil, higher gas and we are seeing some moderating in that.  So we are going to see benefits in terms of our oil, to oil spend if that trend continues and we will see some benefit but to a lesser extent in natural gas because we hedge.", "Mark Weintraub", "Okay.  And then lastly, a totally different topic.  I believe I read somewhere that you recently bought some entitled properties down in Charleston for about $40 million in the last couple of weeks.  I just want to - what is the thinking process or how you are writing that business today, were you actually spending money, are you self financing it through sales of other properties within the land group or are you basically in an investment phase in the land group at this point?  How should we be thinking about that?", "John Luke", "Mark, let me take that up and I will ask Mark to supplement with anything he thinks we should.  We are looking at that business to be a self financing business where there are opportunities to make select high value acquisitions at very very attractive prices particularly where there are entitlement features that can be matched up with strategies that we already have in place.  We will look at that, but again to you point, principally on a self financing basis and wherever possible as a dimension of that as in this case, we would look for very attractive tax efficient swaps to play a role and providing the basis for this.  So it\u2019s a matter of aiming at business for other reasons that we have talked about the distinctiveness of this business as opposed to viewing it as simply a slow - some have suggested a slow liquidation.  That\u2019s not what we want to do with this.  There is tremendous richness there that needs to be cultivated as a separate business, thus our continuing evaluation of alternative ownership structures.", "Mark Weintraub", "Okay.  And for instance you would expect to take advantage of 10/31 or\u2026?", "John Luke", "Yes sir, you are exactly right.", "Mark Weintraub", "Okay.  Thank you.", "Operator", "Thanks.  And our next question then comes from the line of Peter Ruschmeier with Barclays Capital.  Please go ahead.", "Peter Ruschmeier", "Thanks.  Good morning.", "John Luke", "Hey Pete.", "Mark Rajkowski", "Good morning.", "Peter Ruschmeier", "A question for Mark.  You gave us the cash flow from operations year-to-date, but I think that was - but you haven\u2019t given us the restated cash flows for 1Q, 2Q.  Do you have the third quarter cash flow from operations?", "Mark Rajkowski", "Actually that\u2019s what I did give you.  I gave you the third quarter cash flow, which was 39 million.", "Peter Ruschmeier", "39 million, okay.  And I guess a related question was, I am trying to connect the dots on the net debt decline, 329 million sequentially, your proceeds from Charleston I think were 466 million and -- but your CapEx was I think only 67 million.  Were there some acquisitions in the quarter I am missing?", "Mark Rajkowski", "Very small.  We did acquire, as Jim mentioned in his remarks, the assets of a couple of discussed companies, but both of those were under $10 million.  So when I look at our debt outstanding, we are down about $240 million.", "Peter Ruschmeier", "Okay.  But your cash balance was up, correct?", "Mark Rajkowski", "Cash balance is up.", "Peter Ruschmeier", "Okay.  Maybe a question for Jim on the consumer solutions business.  I was curios if you can remind us how big is the media packaging business now and roughly as a percent of that business and help us with the trend if you would?  I know it\u2019s been under pressure, but is it - are sales trending down 5%, is it less than that?  Any color on that would be helpful.", "James Buzzard", "Sure, Pete.  You can think of our global media business and that would include both print and plastics, in Q3, about $150 million and fundamentally flat from a year ago.  Within that we saw some decline on the print side and proven on the plastic side.  As I said, we are seeing some nice gains and gains.  Blu-Ray was small, it\u2019s trending up nicely, but that was offset by a little bit of a decline in the print side as well.", "Peter Ruschmeier", "Okay, that\u2019s actually very helpful.  And I guess related to consumer, the Shellpak business.  Can you quantify how big is that business today or how big are you trying to scale, I am just trying to understand the order of magnitude, how big a contribution that\u2019s likely to be?", "James Buzzard", "We think the return on Shellpak can be a very contribution for us.  As you know it is featured in the $4 generic program for Wal-Mart and they are continuing to add drugs as we speak, so we are seeing very rapid growth with Shellpak.  A number of other important retailers are looking at it.  We have brought some on board.  And we are seeing the pharmaceutical companies also looking at this packaging solution.  So we have very high hope for that product and the trends right now are extremely positive.", "Peter Ruschmeier", "Okay.  Last question if I could, maybe back to Mark.  I think seasonally your working capital has often been a large source of cash in the fourth quarter.  Any reason to think that will be any different this year and can you help us understand how large of a contribution that might be on the working capital swing?", "Mark Rajkowski", "Your recollection is correct, Peter.  It is traditionally a source of \u2013 good source of cash and we expect that to continue to be the case in the fourth quarter of this year and we are looking to be even more aggressive in terms of managing our inventories and our past dues on receivables to wing out even more cash for the fourth quarter of this year given where the economic condition are at these days.", "Peter Ruschmeier", "Very good.  And just a comment I thought the slides this quarter I think were particularly helpful.  I appreciate the detail.  Thanks I will turn over.", "Operator", "Thank you.  And our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.  Please go ahead.", "Mark Wilde", "Good morning I would like to just take step back and look at the consumer solutions business, because if I just work of the back of the envelop here, we paid $3.25 billion dollars for Calmar.  We did a number of other acquisitions earlier in a decade, I mean it all adds up to over $2 billion plus the business has the legacy meet beverage packaging business which was quite large.  Some legacy WestVaco businesses and then we had capital projects in Eastern Europe and Chine and in Brazil.  In that last year we only generated EBITDA of 86 million, for the first nine months of this year it\u2019s only 45 million.  What's not working here?", "John Luke", "Mark, I will pick up and answer.  I think you have raised the question that probably will take longer and more thorough response then the time we have and I think that there are a variety of things that are working and there are variety of things that are challenges that we are actively working.  First of all, I don\u2019t want to go out of wait to validate all of your numbers, I think that we need in any response to call those together and talk from that standpoint.  What is important is that we have a business that is contributed along with our overall paperboard business to focusing ever more intently on end consumer markets that are growing around the world.  Certainly we have been able to succeed and grow with several of these businesses notably in the healthcare and despite the immediate challenges in the market place the beverage business.  In other cases we have been hit with unusual challenges that we are not forecast a decade ago when we maybe acquisition and the media business, which is some of the current technology base challenges.  So we have been faced with some market adjustments in technology challenges along the way.  I put that to offer perspective of bottom line though is that while we can focus on the things that haven\u2019t gone well there are a variety of things that have gone well and from those the company is positioned more effectively today to grow in market that represent fairly attractive and profitable potentials over the longer haul.  It\u2019s a broader questions is a very sound question, I will be happy to sit down or address these issues at sometime as we have a bit more time.", "Mark Wilde", "Yeah that\u2019s fair enough.  I mean John from my perspective, numbers never seemed - we never seemed to get there on the numbers?", "John Luke", "I understand your point.", "Mark Wilde", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you.  And our last question this morning comes from the line of Richard Skidmore with Goldman Sachs.  Please go ahead.", "Richard Skidmore", "Good morning.  Just a quick question with regards to foreign exchange and the amount of sales that you have coming out of Europe and other places that have seen some weakness in their currency.  How should we think about the translation impact as we move into 2009?", "Mark Rajkowski", "Rick, I mean who knows where the currencies are headed.  We did include comments in our outlook just given heads up relative to current rates that we are seeing and the fact that both in case of Real and the Euro, they are lower than they were the fourth quarter of last year and that\u2019s certainly going to have an impact.  But where they go it\u2019s difficult to tell because of how volatile all these markets are these days.", "Richard Skidmore", "Mark, could you provide maybe a percentage of revenue break down in those respective regions like Europe.  How much was Europe and how much is either Latin America or Brazil of your total revenue in the third quarter?", "Mark Rajkowski", "You know, I would have to get back to on that.  I don\u2019t have that off the top of my head, Rick.", "Richard Skidmore", "Okay, thank you.", "Mark Rajkowski", "Jason will get you that information.", "Richard Skidmore", "Okay, that\u2019s it.  Thank you.", "Operator", "Thanks.  And I would like to turn the call back over to the company's management for any closing statements.", "Jason Thompson", "Thanks for joining us everyone.  We look forward to followup questions and Ken if you could please provide the replay information.  Now that concludes our remarks.  Thanks everyone.", "Operator", "Certainly, sure well.  And ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available starting today October 29th at noon Eastern Time and it will be available through Saturday, November 29th at mid night Eastern Time.

(RKT) F4Q08 (Qtr End 09/30/08) Earnings Call November  4, 2008  9:30 AM ET", "Executives", "John Spiegel - VP and Treasurer", "James Rubright - Chairman and CEO", "Steven Voorhees - EVP and CFO", "Analysts", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Cameron Newton - Wachovia", "Matthew Clark - Prudential Financial", "Bill Hoffman - UBS", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Operator", "At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Rock-Tenn fourth quarter 2008 Earnings Call.", "(Operator Instructions)", "Your speaker for today's call, are Mr. John Spiegel, Vice President, Treasurer, Mr. Steve Voorhees, Chief Financial Officer, and Mr. James Rubright, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.", "Mr. Spiegel, you may begin your conference.", "John Spiegel", "Thank you, Trey. Welcome to Rock-Tenn's fiscal fourth quarter 2008 conference call. I am John Spiegel, Vice President and Treasurer of Rock-Tenn. Also joining me on the call are Jim Rubright, CEO and Steve Voorhees, CFO.", "During the course of the conference call we may make statements that are not historical in nature and may involve forward looking statements, within the meaning of Federal Securities law. For example, statements regarding our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events are forward-looking statements, which involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Many of which are beyond our control and that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed.", "Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties is contained in the documents that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents include the company's Form 10-K filed for the year ended September 30, 2007, and our subsequent Form 10-Q since that date.", "During the call, we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are contained in the fourth quarter press release, which is available on Rock-Tenn's website at rocktenn.com. Also during the call we will be referring to credit agreement EBITDA for 2007. Reconciliation to this measure can be found in our August 2008, Investor Presentation located at rocktenn.com", "I will now turn the call over to Steve Voorhees, who will review our financial results. Steve.", "Steve Voorhees", "Thanks John. Rock-Tenn reported another quarter of record revenue, of $786 million, up 30% over the last year and 2% over the last quarter.", "Strong sales growth in consumer packaging and corrugated packaging and pricing improvements in our businesses enabled us to outrun very high input costs during the quarter, and our newly acquired corrugated packaging operations continued to exceed our expectation.", "Rock-Tenn reported fourth quarter net income of $28 million or $0.74 per share. On an adjusted basis, Rock-Tenn earned $0.90 per share, 58% more than the $0.57 per share reported in the fourth quarter of last year.", "Rock-Tenn reported $8.1 million of restructuring cost, consisting primarily of acquisition integration cost of $1.8 million, the cost of corrugated plant consolidations of $2.3 million, and the amortization of acquisition related deferred, compensation expenses of $2.1 million. We refer to this $2.1 million as ESU expenses during our conference calls earlier this year.", "We also incurred $2.1 million of restructuring costs from the closing of our folding carton plant in Baltimore.", "During the September quarter, we adjusted the value assigned to the inventory at the time of Southern Container acquisition. This increased the purchasing accounting step up in the value of the acquired inventory by $1.3 million. This was expensed during the quarter and adjusted out, as we did in the second and third quarters.", "The integration of Southern Container and Rock-Tenn has continued to proceed very successfully. During the quarter we consolidated our Greenville and Spartanburg, South Carolina sheet plants. We have now fully integrated our legacy corrugated operations into the Southern Container box plant system. We expect to achieve $15 million in annual rate run synergies by June of next year.", "Rock-Tenn's results this quarter reflect our new segment reporting structure. Before, reporting segments included consumer packaging, which consist of the folding carton business, and six coated paperboard mills, corrugated packaging, which includes Solvay and St. Paul containerboard mills, and our corrugated converting operation, our Merchandising Displays business, and four Specialty Paperboard Products, which include five Specialty Paperboard mills, 16 converting locations, and our recycled fiber procurement and trading activities.", "Turning back to the consolidated results for the quarter; non-allocated expenses increased by $2 million to $8.9 million in the quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher accounting audit and systems cost, driven by the size of the company after the Southern Container acquisition. Perspectively we expect these costs to run at a rate of about $8 million per quarter.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter were $24.5 million, below depreciation and amortization of $38.7 million. For the full year, capital expenditures of $84 or $51 million are below depreciation, amortization of $135 million, and below our prior guidance of $90 million.", "So fiscal year 2009, we expect to invest $90 million of capital in our business, below the full year depreciation amortization expense of approximately $155 million.", "Turning to our defined benefit retirement plans were $256 million at the end of September. This compares to $326 million projected benefit obligation at the end of September.", "For fiscal year 2009, we expect our book expense related to these plans to be approximately $17 million, as compared to $7 million in fiscal year 2008. We expect to contribute $25 million to our defined benefit retirement plans in fiscal year 2009.", "Rock-Tenn reduced net debt during the quarter by $62 million, making for a total reduction of $150 million for the six months since the March quarter, when we acquired Southern Container.", "With the increase in credit agreement EBITDA to $458 million, we reduced our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio from 4.2 times at the time we closed of Southern Container acquisition to March, to 3.6 times at September 30, 2008.", "Clearly, many things are working well at Rock-Tenn at the same time. The Southern Container acquisition added $0.29 per share to earnings for the quarter.", "Yesterday, we used our senior credit facility to redeem $129 million of debt at Solvay Paperboard. This frees up approximately $73 million of cash at Solvay that was required to be held under the terms of the Solvay bonds.", "We will return $44 million of this cash to the sellers of Southern Container as required by the acquisition agreement. We will use the remaining $29 million to reduce debt at Rock-Tenn.", "There was a 2% or $2.4 million redemption premium paid to the holders of Solvay bonds. This premium was funded by the sellers of Southern Container. This premium, even though funded by the sellers, will be expensed on Rock-Tenn's financial statements in the December quarter and shown as debt extinguishment cost and will be adjusted out of earnings for the quarter.", "We will make an additional payment of approximately $70 million to the sellers of Southern Container this month to reimburse them for taxes that they will pay as a consequence of the section 338(h) (10) election made as part of the acquisition.", "The $70 million payment and the $44 million in cash returned to the sellers as part of the Solvay bond redemptions are shown as debt on our balance sheet as of September 30. Total debt and net debt will not change as a result of these payments.", "After these payments are made, we anticipate that Rock-Tenn will have over $200 million in availability under our senior credit facility. This provides more than adequate liquidity for our business.", "Going forward we expect annual interest expense to be in the range of $105 million to $110 million per year. Approximately 35% or $575 million of our debt will be at floating interest rates.", "We continue to expect to reduce our debt-to-EBITDA ratio to three times by September 2010. Given our progress over the last six months, it appears likely that we will obtain our goal prior to September, 2010.", "Jim will now discuss our operating results and outlook. Jim?", "James Rubright", "Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Well this quarter, the numbers pretty well speak for themselves. Strong sales, high operating rates, operating excellence within our business units and strong accretion from the Southern Container acquisition all combined the results in a record earnings that we reported and record adjusted earnings, which were up 58% from the fourth quarter of 2007, and up 29% from the June quarter.", "Segment income was higher than last year in each of our operating segments, except for Consumer Packaging segment, where higher pricing for coated paperboard could not completely offset, very high input costs during the quarter. Especially for fiber and energy, both of which started out high and then with the exception of virgin fiber declined across the quarter.", "Bleached and recycled ton shipped, were up during the quarter over last year. Folding carton volumes were flat, in an industry that was slightly down. Display sales were up again, up over the prior year quarter and the September, 2007 quarter.", "You step back and look at the changes at Rock-Tenn overtime, I think a very good measure of the improvement of our business profile and our performance is the increase in our EBITDA margin.", "Many of you will recall that in our Southern Container acquisition investor presentation, we showed credit agreement EBITDA margins pre-acquisition of 12.4% and 14% pro forma for the acquisition. During the September quarter just completed, our actual adjusted EBITDA margin had increased to 15.4%.", "As good as those results in the quarter were, actually each month in the quarter got better. Demand for our products continued to be good throughout the quarter. Thus is July's peak natural gas and high recycled fiber cost backed off across the quarter and the July $55 container board increased and the related box price increases went into effect in August and September, our monthly results improved.", "Our outlook for next year should be for continued strong earnings and cash flow as recycled fiber and energy costs are much lower today than last quarter's average as are detailed, and the sales resiliency in times of economic stress, of the large proportion of our sales that are for food and beverage, paper products, health and beauty products, and other consumer non-durables should support our sales volumes, compared to many other businesses.", "I would like to return to recycled fiber. We saw sharp OCC declines for both October and November. About half of our OCC price is off of Buffalo and North Eastern OBM, and the balance price is primarily off of Chicago and Southeast and Southwest.", "Today, Chicago and Buffalo OBM are each $45 per ton, and that compares to an average for the quarter of $87 per ton for Chicago, and $110 per ton for Buffalo. If you compare that to the last year's September quarter, they were both at $115 a ton.", "In total, OCC represents about 75% of our total recycled fiber requirements, and those total recycled fiber requirements are about 2.1 million-tons per year. Although, I will not detail them in the call, I would also point out that most other recycled grades have shown similar, very significant downward cost moves.", "Energy is also a major cost input for Rock-Tenn. Natural gas closed at $7.47 per Mcf for October, and $6.47 for November 2008, which will be reflected in our December quarter earnings. December is currently trading at $6.84. Those prices compare to an average for the September quarter that we just reported, of $10.24 per Mcf and $6.16 for the December 2007 quarter.", "We did not buy natural gas forward this year when prices were high, so our costs for the current quarter will fully reflect the price declines from the September quarter that I have just outlined.", "Other important costs for us, such as chemicals, starch and transportation have not yet seen comparable declines from the averages of the September quarter, but the downward movement in oil and natural gas prices should prove helpful there as well as, as it will be with transportation costs.", "In contrast to the declines in prices that I have just outlined, virgin fiber costs were much higher than last year, with wood costs for our Bleach Board mill up 27% in the September quarter over the September '08, '07 quarter, so the year-over-year comparison is up 27%. Unlike costs of recycled fiber, our costs for virgin fiber remain high today, and we believe due in large part to the housing slowdown.", "I would like talk about the current pricing environment. Published index, paperboard and container board pricing improved significantly since the ends of the June quarter, and we have been passing those price increases through, to our paperboard and packaging customers.", "Overall, average pricing for the quarter for paperboard and container board increased $19 per ton over the prior quarter average. Just pointing out what many of you all know, since June of 2008, containerboard had $55 per ton price increase, published in July, which we began to recover in August and September on our 954,000-tons of annual capacity.", "In bleach paperboard, $40 per ton was published in October 2008, and we will begin to recover that price increase in November and December on our 335,000 tons of annual capacity.", "We saw a $35 per ton increase published in August of 2008 on Coated Recycled Board, which we began to recover on our 620,000 tons of CRB capacity. Uncoated Recycled Board saw a $45 per ton price increase published also in August of 2008, and we will begin recovering that in our uncoated mills, which is known as smaller of our segments, and we have a number of contracts there that affect pricing and with respect to the portion of that product that goes into industrial markets. I think we will see head winds that will not necessarily be the case particular with other grades.", "On the other hand, pulp pricing has declined, for us the decline is approximately $30 per ton on our approximately 100,000 tons of annual capacity. Given the production we anticipate of SPS, I think our market tons of pulp this year will be below that 100,000 ton number, perhaps by 10% to 15%.", "Regarding containerboard pricing for this quarter, while it is true that recycled fiber and natural gas cost have declined, virgin costs, certainly as we see them, have increased. As I mentioned earlier, and they remain high as we speak. So, that should translate into a relative competitive advantage for recycle producers such as Rock-Tenn.", "Looking to the current December quarter, this is typically our weakest quarter seasonally in paperboard and consumer packaging, as we typically experience a falloff in demand for folding cartons and recycled paperboard, especially, as we approach the Thanksgiving holiday and then through the end of the year.", "This December quarter, we have taken an abbreviated maintenance outage at our Demopolis bleach board mill. We will not take a major outage, as we have in each of the last three years. We have made a number of operational improvements that would allow us to move to an 18 month major outage schedule.", "Thus, we expect to take a major outage in the third quarter of this fiscal year, but then we will not take one in fiscal 2010. The October outage will reduce this quarter's earnings by several cents per share, but the net effect of these changes over the full cycle will be lower maintenance costs in total.", "Looking at the current demand environment; demand for our products is going to vary by product category. As a whole, we see our demand as better than general economic data than I have seen, as we would expect.", "Backlogs for bleached paperboard are good. Backlogs for recycled board have not changed materially from the averages of last quarter. While the industry data shows decline in containerboard and box demand, our containerboard mills continue to run full as we speak, and our box plan inventories in bookings, which were weak in early October actually strengthened late in the month.", "The integration of Southern Container in our legacy corrugated plants is proceeding very well, as are the steps we have taken so far to integrate corporate services. The Southern Container acquisition continues to achieve results ahead of our acquisition operating cases, in all three areas of their business: containerboard, with higher pricing and the increase of 50,000 tons per year in annual production capacity; and the box plants; and the graphic plants.", "Our targeted sales plans and operational improvements have led to continued sales and earnings growth. The fact is that notwithstanding weak industry volumes. We grew our corrugated box plant volumes in the September quarter, when we grew them compared both to the June '08 quarter and the September '07 quarter.", "Our box plant volumes in the acquired plants increased 6% over the June quarter and 22% over the September '07 quarter, while the mill tons sold were up 11% over the June quarter and 16% over the September '07 quarter. As Steve said, we estimate that the acquisition added $0.29 per share to adjusted earnings for the quarter.", "I think, based on our current demand for containerboard and corrugated packaging, the earnings and cash flow accretion showed from the acquisition should continue strong into fiscal 2009, if only as I noted before because recycled fiber costs today are significantly lower than last quarter.", "Overall, the strategic moves that we have made over the last few years to now operate the lowest cost coated recycled paperboard system in North America, the lowest cost folding bleach board mills and one of the newest and lowest cost containerboard mills. As well as the increasing profitability of our folding carton business, primarily through the Gulf States acquisition and through aggressive pursuit of operational and administrative excellence, have made Rock-Tenn an exceptional for the rule of our industry and positioned us we believe for exceptional performance in the years ahead.", "I want to thank you for your continued interest in our company, and Steve and I are now prepared to answer questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). First question does come from Claudia Hueston of JPMorgan. You may ask your question.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "I was hoping you could provide just a little more detail on what you're seeing in the corrugated box business. Obviously, it sounds like your trends have been a little different than the industry and then you commented that things have picked over the course of October. Just wondering are there specific markets or areas where you're seeing trends, any color there would be helpful.", "James Rubright", "Yes, if you compare Southern Container's business profile and Rock-Tenn's, we have a higher percentage of our end markets in food, beverage, paper products of various categories, which could be personal care, for example. So our business is going to be a little more resilient, we think than an industrial packaging business.", "Now to be clear, October was weak, and we saw our backlogs decline, probably 10% to 15% in the first couple of weeks of October. But then they came back up not to where they would have been at the offset of the quarter, but they increased in the last week of the quarter.", "So, while we see weakness in the markets, it may just be our positioning that causes us to be somewhat stronger than other participants. The other thing is that the data has been flowing in, which causes me to say that it has not perfect predictive value. But simply on a Mcf shift basis we feel that our volumes were relatively consistent with our expectations for the quarter. In fact I'm not ignoring the fact that there is a weak economy, I'm simply reporting what we're seeing from volume data in our plants.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "It's helpful. Good to hear. And then I guess, just looking at the display business I was curious just how that turned in through the quarter and drew into October. Has there been any slowing in that business at all?", "James Rubright", "I don't have a lot of visibility for what the December quarter would be, but there is also a lot of ebb and flow. So given the strength of the October quarter, and the fact that we're heading into the holiday season, I would expect that business to weaken. And we've seen a shift, so that I'm not sure where the revenues are going to come out or sheets produced in the manufacturing plants are down. But we've got in a high level of product manipulation activity in the assembly plant. So it's a little hard to say where that's going, but I question whether the business continued to be as strong as it has been?", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "Okay, and then just finally. Any thoughts on where OCC is going to end up here? And have you noticed any changes just in competitive behavior with the decline in OCC?", "James Rubright", "I won't comment on the latter, but with respect to OCC, we have had the conversation before. We have looked at those $115-$125 prices, and said, well, the mean reverting price is $75, and Steve and I were just going over the 10-year trend, and the mean reverting price is now $72.15 or something like that. So you may ask me what's OCC going to be, I'm going to tell you it is $72, but really, the markets are so weak right now. And that's the way it is.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "", "Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Operator", "Christopher Chun of Deutsche Bank, you may ask your question.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "First of all I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the new maintenance outage schedule. I am wondering, compared to last year, what different impact might be this year?", "James Rubright", "I think that the outage itself is going to cost us somewhere between $0.02 and $0.05, which is a fraction of what a major outage costs, which basically pretty well wipes out profitability for a month and a half or something like that, depending upon the experience you have in your outage.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Right. And how does that compare to last year's quarter?", "James Rubright", "Well, I think if you, what I would rather do is compare it to the immediately preceding quarter, I am going to lose $0.02 and $0.05 as a result of that outage.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Right. Do you recall last year though, how many cents you lost relative to the previous quarter last year?", "James Rubright", "I do not. And I know that's an important for purpose of your modeling. We'll get back to you on it, but, the reason I'm not myself focused on last year's, you have to take a four-year look at the cost of an outage, because of the various a) execution and b) the scope of the outages, which you take, so it can vary significantly, but we'll get back to you with respect to the specific year-over-year comparison.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, fair enough. Recently the US dollar been quite volatile, I am wondering how you see the impact of that on the company's business?", "James Rubright", "It certainly is a factor, but if you go back to the acquisition of Gulf States in 2005, we sat down and said there were several driving factors that led us to that acquisition. One of them would have been a weak dollar. Essentially, you had a continuation of what we thought then was a relatively weak dollar, and then in 2008, you had a round trip, right? The dollar got really weak and then turned around and came back. So people are saying what do think the strengthening of the dollar means?", "Well, I think that it means something relative to 2008, but with respect to 2005, you still have a relatively weak dollar, relative to global currency flows. So, I don't think it has that significant effect, because I don't know that in 2008 you could have fully reflected the quick up and quick down of the dollar, just as the quick up and quick down of the oil price, which on the chart looks like the same pattern, I don't know how that flowed through the economy.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "All right, do you do much export business either in containerboard or bleached?", "James Rubright", "We do not.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Then in terms of your balance sheet and your debt, I am wondering if you have any significant maturities coming up?", "James Rubright", "We do not. Our credit agreement was a five-year credit agreement that we used to refinance the bank debt and do the primary financing for Southern Container. And then we did a seven-year note issue that we closed in March. We do have a '11 maturity $250 million in notes and then '013 maturity of another $100 million in public notes.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then in terms of your CapEx, I think you mentioned $90 million for next year. Do you see that as sort of a normal run-rate number?", "Steven Voorhees", "No, I think 80 to 85 is really a normal run rate number for us. We had indicated that there was some CapEx that we had intended to spend that was acquisition related and the 90 is a little lower than the 95. The 90 to 95 range we have been at just as the 83 that we spent was really probably a little bit lower than the range we expected for this year. So, and I guess we were conservative in our guidance when we originally gave it.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And congratulations on a solid performance in a very difficult environment, guys, I'll turn it over.", "James Rubright", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Cameron Newton of Wachovia, you may ask your question.", "Cameron Newton - Wachovia", "Maybe this is more of the big predicted question. You're going to reach your leverage target ahead of schedule here. It looks like at least from that model. Historically, you had some very successful acquisitions in the Gulf States and now Southern Container. As you look across the landscape here, you're going to have a lot of assets on the market it looks like. I'm just wondering if there is any in anyone of these businesses right now, is it containerboard or anything that you might look to expand in here if the right opportunity comes up?", "James Rubright", "Well, if you go back and look at what we said. Before we acquired Southern Container, we said we were looking to expand in the containerboard business for a number of fundamental economic reasons that are playing out as we speak. Southern Container happened to be the transaction that we saw as being the most desirable that we could transact. So would we continue to look in the containerboard space, yes we will.", "Our acquisition strategy is to acquire superior assets, which typically means low cost assets in the space. There are some attractive assets out there. But it takes two people to do a transaction. The most attractive assets typically are also attractive to people who currently own them.", "So I'm of the view that our business is to generate cash, pay down debt, and if we get our debt targets into an efficient rise and we give it back to our shareholders. All of us in this room being shareholders, and if we have an opportunity to do a really nice transaction such as the ones we've done, fine. If we don't, we'll just continue to execute as we would have.", "Cameron Newton - Wachovia", "Okay. And maybe on the recycled boxboard side of the equation, you had a quite a bit of capacity come out of the system here over the last few months. Maybe you can just speak to pricing, market balance, and CRB, URB. I think you made a comment about the industrial business in URB maybe presenting a challenge to get fuller coverage, the price increase. I'm just wondering what you're seeing in terms of price pressure, if any, there as well?", "James Rubright", "Well, if you look at the industry statistics, CRB data would suggest continuing very high operating rates. In the marketplace, we think there is one of the three major producers who are significantly weaker than the others. But the data would suggest that operating rates are very high. And in our CRB system we took minimal downtime in the third quarter.", "URB operating rates are higher this year than they were last year, and you have seen significant closures. So the industry there, probably from an operating rate standpoint for the continuing operators may in fact be in better shape going into what appears to be a pretty steep downturn in industrial markets than we would have been a year ago. But my comment on the marketplace just indicated.", "I have been looking at industry statistics, and what others with more of an industrial focus on their business have been saying. So I'm just assuming that you're going to see some further reduction in operating income, not further, but just some reduction in operating income, in operating rates in the industrial sector, which would be primarily end markets of tubes and cones.", "So I'm just assuming that that business doesn't have, for example the pricing environment that SBS does, where the operating rates and backlogs, as far as we can tell, continue to be very strong for us and then with respect to the public statements of the other major participants in that business as they comment on their opinion.", "Cameron Newton - Wachovia", "Okay. And then, maybe just one house keeping question; the $1.3 million inventory purchase accounting charges, is that flowing through cogs, and if so, where in the segment results, is that flowing through, corrugated?", "James Rubright", "Yes, exactly.", "Cameron Newton - Wachovia", "Okay. Great. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "[Paul Hunt] of Banc of America, you may ask your question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good mornings, guys. You mentioned couple of times that demand for Rock-Tenn's products tend to be little stronger in the current economic conditions, to your exposure to consumers non-durables. I was just hoping if you could just try and quantify what your particular business has seen in terms of demand declines in prior economic downturns, recessions, have gotten a mid-single decline, any kind of help there is appreciated?", "James Rubright", "I hate to just respond from memory of the 2000, 2001 recession, and then if you go back to an earlier recession, when I wasn't here. So if you really want, we could look at those numbers and if you want the call back we would be glad to do that. That would be better than any of us speculating with respect to specific volume declines that occurred seven or eight years ago. I apologize for doing that, but I don't want to and I can't be accurate enough to go ahead and do it.", "Unidentified Analyst", "That is fine. I will call you off line. And then, just one other thing, it looked to me that working capitals did not exhibit a seasonal dip during the quarter. I just wanted to know was that unusual for a fiscal fourth quarter and if so what prevented us from seeing a dip?", "James Rubright", "Steve, would you want to answer that?", "Steven Voorhees", "I think between June and September, we typically don't see a huge change. We will see some build up in receivables and inventory, but we're able to offset that through the way we've managed our payables.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Understood, thanks guys.", "Operator", "Matthew Clark of Prudential Financial, you may ask your question.", "Matthew Clark - Prudential Financial", "A couple of questions this morning. Can you talk at all about cash receivable facility and what was coming due in middle of November, here? I thought at one point you were talking about maybe upsizing that and extending it out, can you talk at all about what is going on there?", "Steven Voorhees", "Well, we have upsized it. And it's up to $175 million. And it would be renewed as of September. So go a year from September.", "Matthew Clark - Prudential Financial", "So, a 9/30/09 maturity kind of date?", "Steven Voorhees", "September 1st.", "Matthew Clark - Prudential Financial", "Okay. And then can you just tell us how much is drawn as of the end of the quarter on that one, end of September?", "Steven Voorhees", "It's approximately $90 million.", "Matthew Clark - Prudential Financial", "And then is that $90 million included in the $245 million of near-term maturities on the balance sheet?", "Steven Voorhees", "Yes.", "Matthew Clark - Prudential Financial", "Now if I go beyond that, so the remaining $155 million, I'm assuming was entirely related to the Solvay debt, the payment to the prior owners. Is that your incremental $155 million?", "Steven Voorhees", "It was cash to the sellers.", "Matthew Clark - Prudential Financial", "And was the Solvay, $120 million of Solvay included in that number or not?", "Steven Voorhees", "No, it was not long-term.", "James Rubright", "We didn't have to redeem that, it what was reflected as long-term.", "Matthew Clark - Prudential Financial", "", "Okay. So you said something you paid 44 to the sellers, and then you guys pay an incremental 70 to the seller, that's $114 million.", "James Rubright", "Right, exactly.", "Matthew Clark - Prudential Financial", "Okay. And then just I would guess that revolver availability at 930 was about $400 million then as you pay all these, as you pay, prepaid Solvay and pay the owners, that availability drops to about $200 million? Is that the right math?", "James Rubright", "Yes, that's the high level math.", "Matthew Clark - Prudential Financial", "", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Bill Hoffman of UBS, you may ask your question.", "Bill Hoffman - UBS", "Just a follow up on Frank's question, so at the end of the day, we should end up with about 200 drawn on the revolver, is that where you end up?", "James Rubright", "Yes.", "Bill Hoffman - UBS", "Second question is, as we look into the December quarter, I was a bit interested to hear your taking an abbreviated downtime at Demopolis as we look into the December quarter, but also we would like to get a sense on what you think may be occurring from the demand side of the equation, whether you're starting to see some softness. I know you mentioned that October started off soft and got a little bit firmer towards the end of the month. But are you hearing anything from customers about their yearend plans for reducing their own inventories through the chain?", "James Rubright", "What we have seen so far is a somewhat softer market for us, and then if you go back to October of '07. But it is not a dramatic change in what you've seen. And if you look at it across more than just October and September, because our comparison is October '08 versus October '07, October '07 was a very strong month. And September '08 was a very strong month. So if you look at September '07 and October '07 compared to this year, folding cartons were about flat for the two months. And as I have indicated at least the production in corrugated was significantly stronger.", "So we see weakness. But again we're heading into a period of time that is seasonally weak. So, it's the demand that you see seasonal weakness, is it the economy? I don't know. Frankly I think we're going weakness because rest of the world is in a deep recession. But as we have indicated if consumer spending is off 3% and restaurant spending is off 4%, does that mean Rock-Tenn sales are down or up. I don't know, because as we've gone through other times, when go into the grocery store and you get a chicken in a white box, that's probably sales of paperboard, somebody printed it somewhere. Dry food and frozen food that's what we package.", "So we're not necessarily going to correlate with even a category such as consumer's non-durables, because we are correlated but the fits not perfect. We have also talked about the fact that there is ebb and flow in the supply chain and the inventory chain is very difficult for us to take a look at the three week period of time, and then tell you what that means for volumes going forward.", "So our view is much more, we live in the same world as everybody else. So we're going to see some of that effect, even though it's muted in the numbers that we're getting reported of out the physical production in our facilities.", "Bill Hoffman - UBS", "Thanks, I appreciate the color. A final question, just looking into 2009, I think, you originally, your the capital expenditure target was in the 95 to 100 range. Any changes, any thoughts on that?", "James Rubright", "Well, the 90 reflects our current view. We have a dynamic capital budgeting process. We revise it on an ongoing basis. We're not locked in a particular, one year plan and so forth, although we're always looking a year ahead. So, just today I would say that what we anticipate spending is a little bit less than we would have anticipated when we originally set that guidance.", "But it's essentially for purposes of looking at the company on a post acquisition basis, when we were looking at our maintenance capital, our projects and then our anticipated synergy or acquisition rated CapEx, where we would have said 90 to 95 this year in 2008 then and 90 to 95, 2009.", "Today looking at those same numbers with the projects that we expect to execute, we think that the 83 that spent this year was just what we spend. We really think it will be 90 next year. But depending upon opportunities that we see, as well as what's happening in the marketplace that 90 will change, could go up and could go down.", "Bill Hoffman - UBS", "Right. Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our last question does come from Mark Wilde of Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning, Jim. Good morning, Steve.", "James Rubright", "Good morning, Mark.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "I want to start off by just pointing out that you have a much larger competitor reported earnings last week, and their consumer packaging business, which has about three or four times the SBS volumes that you guys have, had $6 million in EBITDA in the quarter, which I think is pretty remarkable. So congratulations on that.", "I wondered if you can talk a little bit about the state of the folding carton market. I'm particularly curious as to whether some of the consolidation and rationalization moves, we've seen over the last 12 to 24 months, whether you think that's having any effect now on the market? And also just thoughts on whether you want to grow in that converting business any further over time?", "James Rubright", "", "Number one, with respect to the market, we are seeing opportunities as result of that consolidation that we would not have seen, we think, in our judgment, absent the degree of consolidation that's occurred over the last, I would say 18 months. Those opportunities may be very large consumer products companies, who have now a very consolidated supply base, who would like to expand that supply base, and therefore they're willing to consider opportunities that they felt no need to consider a year ago. So we're seeing that in the marketplace.", "Secondly, there are number of customers of ultimately, let's say CRB customers, who now are looking at their source of supply somewhat differently, maybe providing opportunities for us that we would not have seen. So the principal change that we've seen is an opportunity set that we wouldn't have seen.", "I won't comment necessarily on pricing or competitive behavior, you understand that, but any way, there has been some change in the marketplace, although, it's yet to be a sea change. And then please, if you don't mind, the second half of your question was?", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "I was just curious about your thoughts on expanding any further in the converting business; in the carton business?", "James Rubright", "We've grown our sales. Our business was a $670 million business, when we started here in 1999. It is $1 billion, close to $1.2 billion today. So we have grown in the business, but we've grown, even though we've consolidated plants, and I guess Gulf States have probably $350 million in converting sales, when we acquired them. So we have grown, but we've grown primarily internally by building larger, very competitively-structured plants from a cost standpoint. The only acquisitions we've done other than Gulf States was our very high-end folding carton business in Canada, and then an unsuccessful foray into the West Coast with a very low-end carton business.", "So as we look at the market, we typically said, we are not really a roll up strategy, because it's difficult to find assets as good as ours. Again, I come back to the fact that if we do an acquisition, we're going to buy really good assets, and they're hard to find. So we would like to grow in the business. We're currently earning across the capital in folding carton and converting, but we're not going to force it.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "What about, Jim, just going a little further up in the market? You are more bread and butter, as you say kind of food and consumer non-durables, and I don't think you have any real presence in things like pharma and healthcare at this point?", "James Rubright", "Well, it is a small presence. It has not been our primary target market. But we have three plants, two of which are pretty much exclusively devoted to those marketplaces. So we have good visibility. Would we acquire others? Typically we have looked at a number of pharma healthcare type folding carton acquisitions, label insert companies to fill out our marketplace and so forth. But we really haven't seen a company that we could acquire for a price that we felt was realistic in relation to the opportunities that are there in our ability to create value, so it is what's happened.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, and then I wanted to switch into the Corrugated business. If it is possible to get just a little bit better sense of what you did to get such big volume increases through the Southern box plants. I mean, those were really enormous numbers in the context of almost any kind of economy?", "James Rubright", "Yes, they are, and it's just a tribute to the Southern Container management team, their focus and their ability to execute. As you know, we believe we got the best box plant system in North America. We certainly have the best graphics capabilities and very large, very low box plants. So they got and then they have got the pricing of the Solvay mill. So they have got just a competitive advantage. But they're not really attacking the market with the price. They attack the market with service and deliver and customer satisfaction.", "I think I can prove that based on the margins that that business generates. You can't generate those margin and really be attacking the markets solely on the basis of price or really on the basis of price. But Mark, their record is to grow like they've grown, and they saw, they opened the Solvay mill in 1994 with a 150,000 tons of capacity. And they needed three partners to do that and it is now 750,000 tons and 70% of that is going through the Southern Container system directly or through swaps.", "So they have a management team and a sales team that is incredibly focused on exploiting opportunities in the marketplace. We have worked for nine years on customer satisfaction and we think customer satisfaction that we obtain, which we measure very carefully is a terrific strength. We included them in our process this year and they came out just where we were. They have very high customer satisfaction. The answer is it's a 1,000 things, but it's not something new. It's something they had done pretty consistently at least for the last 10 years is just the way we looked at.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, one last question, now you mentioned that the tenure average on OCC is up about $70-$75. With pricing so low right now, would you do anything to kind of go along OCC, if you could go forward and it is the type of prices we're looking at right now?", "James Rubright", "Sure, I mean, if you could go forward at current market prices based on the philosophy or business viewpoint I have articulated, you would go along. The fact is the market is extremely liquid, and the hedge premiums in the market are also very large. So it's not practical, we do have a trading business and we take positions as you know and we I think we'll turn those profits as we turn around positions. So we got good visibility in what's possible in the market is just not possible to capitalize in a major way in the current price environment.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "All right, just actually one other thing on that waste paper. Is it, do you have any exposure to export OCC going offshore, I mean I've heard about a lot of offshore mills, particularly Asian mills may be reneging on contracts or trying to renegotiate contracts mid-ocean. It just sounds like all this is going to cause a lot of turmoil in the entire sort of wastepaper chain, and I wondered what you're doing to kind of watch your risk there?", "James Rubright", "Well, we may just be fortunate because of our business positions, Mark. We have as you know, for us a significant recycle trading business, which is both physical and a brokerage business and as I mentioned we'll trade around our positions. But we're focused on our mill system. Our mill system is located in the middle of the country, basically. We don't have a port-oriented mill. So our recycled trading and the physical delivery is typically in this middle of the country and not for export. So we have -- I'm going to say none and I think the answer is none. But it is certainly a de minimis, if any exposure to the kinds of risks that you're talking about with respect to export OCC.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, very good.

This cost was funded by the Southern Container shareholders.", "We incurred $1.3 million pre-tax or $0.02 per share after tax in operating losses, primarily in connection with the previously announced closure of our folding carton plant in Baltimore.  After these adjustments of $0.17 a share, Rock-Tenn reported $0.96 in adjusted EPS, a $0.45 improvement over the $0.51 in adjusted EPS reported last year.", "For calendar year 2008, we earned $2.47 per share and $3.22 per share on an adjusted basis.  Southern Container added approximately $0.42 per share to earnings for the quarter and $0.94 per share to earnings for the ten months we've owned Southern Container since March of 2008.", "At the time of the acquisition, we anticipated $10 million in annual synergies.  We subsequently raised that number to $15 million during our April conference call.  We have achieved an annual run rate of synergies in excess of $10 million and continue to expect to achieve $15 million during this fiscal year.", "Turning to working capital, we added $9 million to inventory in the quarter.  This is primarily board in our consumer packaging and corrugated packaging converting plants and is a normal seasonal pattern in our business.", "Outstanding receivables declined by $34 million.  Paid sales outstanding were between 35 and 36 days, the same as the September quarter.  Given current economic conditions, we increased our bad debt reserve by $2.5 million during the quarter.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter were $14 million, below depreciation and amortization of $38 million.  We have reduced our planned capital expenditures for fiscal year 2009 by $10 million.  We expect to invest $80 million, possibly $85 million back into our business in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2009, below our full year depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $152 million.", "For fiscal year 2009, we expect booked pension expense, including the expense associated with multi-employer plans to be approximately $18 million, as compared to our $9 million expense last year and an average expense of $15 million during the two fiscal years prior to last year.", "We expect to contribute $26 million to our pension plans in fiscal year 2009, this compares to our $16 million contribution last year and average contributions of $21 million during the two fiscal years before that.", "We reduced net debt during the quarter by $33 million, making a total reduction of $184 million for the nine months since the March quarter when we acquired Southern Container.  We have reduced our debt to EBITDA leverage ratio from 4.2 times at the time we closed the Southern Container acquisition, to 3.5 times at December 31, 2008.  This moves us closer to our goal of 3 times by September 2010.", "The current portion of long-term debt at the end of December was $192 million.  The $192 million includes $140 million from the receivables securitization facility that extends through September 1 of this year, and $52 million that is mostly amortization of the term loans under our senior credit facility.", "Rock-Tenn's next significant security is $250 million of public notes due in August 2011.  For the month of December, we incurred interest expense of $8.2 million; this is an annual run rate slightly less than $100 million in interest expense.", "Of Rock-Tenn's $1.6 billion in debt as of September 31, fixed interest rates apply to $1.1 billion or 69% of the total.  Floating interest rates apply to approximately $500 million or 31% of the total.  Of the $500 million in floating rate debt, about $200 million a [live] lower floor of 3%.", "During the quarter, we funded the redemption of $129 million in debt at Solvay Paperboard and paid $69 million to the stockholders of Southern Container to reimburse them for the taxes they will incur as a result of the Section 338 (h)(10) election we agreed to make as part of the acquisition.", "At the end of the quarter, Rock-Tenn had borrowed $132 million under our $450 million revolving credit facility.  Rock-Tenn had approximately $282 million in availability under our senior credit facility as of the end of December.  This provides us with very good liquidity for our business.", "Jim will now discuss our operating results and outlook, Jim.", "James Rubright", "Thank you, Steve and good morning.  Our employees again delivered excellent results; the most remarkable aspect was the strong margin improvement for Rock-Tenn.  Overall, EBITDA margins increased to 17% and that's up to the 14, 15% range that we disclosed pro former to the acquisition of Southern Container in March, and 12% pre-acquisition.", "These excellent margin gains and improvements are a function of the cost structure improvements that we've achieved across our businesses and the positioning of our company, primarily as a result of the two major acquisitions in the last three years of the Gulf State's Assets and Southern Container.", "As we outlined in our press release, Southern Container contributed $0.42 per share to adjusted earnings in the quarter and $0.94 since we acquired this great business.  The business has outperformed our expectations really in every way.  For example, for the calendar year 2008, and recall they were a calendar year company, we looked at them on that basis in connection with the acquisition, Southern Container's Box Plant volumes increased 6% in a declining market.", "Their graphics corrugated plant sales increased 21% and that's very significant because of the high value associated with graphics corrugated sales and our view that that's an area that we can develop within their business, and the result of all of that was that the converting plant profits doubled over the prior year.", "Our Solvay Container Board Mill volumes also increased 2% year-over-year.  Even in the difficult December quarter we outperformed the industry based on all the data we've seen so far.  In the December quarter, our box plant volumes were off 5% compared to the prior year quarter and our container board tons shipped were down a little less than 2% over the prior year quarter.", "We did see the steepest declines in the quarter during the month of December and we curtailed significant container board volume in December as we matched our out output to customer demand.", "But our record results are also attributable to the outperformance of our folding carton business.  Although physical volumes were down 5% in folding cartons over the prior year quarter, our consumer product segment earnings were up, as were the operating earnings of our folding carton plants.  In fact, those plants, in a quarter in which volumes were down 1% over the prior year quarter, we actually exceeded our targeted rate of return on sales of folding cartons of 5%.  Again remarkable, as this is our worst quarter for seasonal sales.", "In this business, we continue to make strides in improving the folding carton plant operations and their performance and to capitalize on the significant operating synergies that we've achieved from the 2005 Gulf States acquisition.", "During the quarter, our display sales were weaker as demand for promotional displays declined and our specialty paperboard volumes were down due to lower demand, particularly in the month of December, and I'll discuss both of those in somewhat more detail in a moment.", "The margins in our businesses also benefited from higher pricing and lower cost, primarily for recycled fiber and energy.", "Our prices in the quarter were up for all our paperboard grades, except for pulp, and of course, actual physical sales of recycled fiber in our trading business.  This was a result of 2008 price increases and our prices were up in the first quarter over the September 2008 quarter again, with almost all of our lines except again, for a decline in pulp and recycled fiber pricing and a very slight decline in the pricing for folding cartons that I can't attribute to anything except for perhaps mix.", "The December gains over the 2008 fourth quarter mainly reflect deferred accretion of price increases as contracts roll over or adjust under their terms.", "Prices for recycled fiber declined sharply, as you know, with Chicago OBM averaging for us $48 a ton over the quarter, versus $112 a ton for the prior year quarter and $105.50 for the full fiscal year.  Today, Chicago OBM is $20 per ton and Buffalo is $25 per ton, so we expect to see lower fiber costs this quarter as well.", "Natural gas currently trades at $4.50 an Mcf versus an average of $6.94 for the December quarter and $9.04 for the September '08 fiscal quarter as we've disclosed.  We consume approximately 9 Bcf of natural gas equivalent per year and as a matter of considered policy, we don't hedge away material portions of our natural gas exposure.  So $1 per MCF reduction in natural gas costs is a $9 million annual change for us.", "My expectation is that our investors and analysts would like as much detail on volume patterns during and after the quarter and for the current months as we can provide, so I'll address that in some detail now.", "The overall picture for the December quarter was down of course; however, the pattern over the course of the quarter was not uniform.  For example, folding carton volumes, off 5% for the quarter, were actually higher in the month of December, whereas coded recycled paperboard volumes, particularly sales to independent converters were off significantly in December beyond our normal seasonal expectations.", "Bleached paperboard volumes on the other hand were up 6% quarter-over-quarter.  First, unlike coated recycled paperboard, we took no economic downtime in bleached paperboard, although we did take a three day mini-outage in the quarter as we moved to an 18-month major outage schedule as we discussed in our last call, whereas if you compare the shipping rates to the prior year September quarter we took the major annual outage in that quarter.  So it somewhat affects the quarterly comparison and I'll actually come back to that point.", "Container board demand and box volumes were off really pretty sharply for us in the month of December, making the full quarter decline about 5% over the 2007 quarter.", "On the other hand, like folding cartons, display volumes were weaker in October and November, but they strengthened during the month of December.", "Turning to the month of January, the month got off to a clearly weak start as January typically does.  As we come off our weak December quarter and the holiday shutdowns of so many of our customers.  However, the later part of the month had some tightening that we've seen in some of our markets.", "In folding cartons, our January volumes are a little lower than the prior year and currently we'd project sales to be about 2% lower than last January for the month, and while shipments for coated recycled paperboard for January will be lower as we continue to take economic downtime early in the month, the backlogs today for coated recycled paperboard are basically back to where they were before September when volumes started to decline significantly.", "Our bleached paperboard backlogs are down from historical levels, but that's partly a result of not taking the major outage in the December quarter as I mentioned, which effectively increased our production in our seasonally weakest quarter.  And in any case, with the very large shore position in bleached paperboard that we have in our folding carton business, keeping our Demopolis Mill should not be a problem.  Keeping it full won't be a problem.", "Container board and box plant shipments will be down from last January, but again we've seen some strengthening in the last week or so.  Here, the cost structure of our container board mills, which are 100% recycled, matches up very well with the current environment where lower costs to recycle fiber allow us to remain very profitable, while curtailing production to meet customer demand.", "Demand in our display business appears within normal levels for this season, continuing the trend established during the month of December.", "Our specialty paperboard mills present a mixed picture.  The part of this business that has industrial end markets such as tubes and cores are still quite weak.  On the other hand, the largest end market for that specialty mill business is solid fiber partitions for food and beverage glass packaging.", "Demand for partitions was very low last quarter and at the beginning of the December as we anticipated as our customers took several planned major plant outages, but in late January, we're seeing normal seasonal patterns and then of course in the segment our gypsum liner board mill that contractually sold out to our joint venture partner and continues to perform quite well.", "The area where we have the least visibility is on pricing in the marketplace.  Transaction pricing is most recently down on the January publications, $10 per ton on container board and recycled paperboard and its flat on bleached paperboard.", "In the marketplace, we're seeing some inconsistent behavior and some discounting.  But again, given our large exposure to recycled fiber and natural gas and the low-cost position of our mill system, we have a good bit of cushion and we believe that cushion will allow us to continue to generate strong earnings and cash flow in the current economic climate.", "We don't think that the economic climate that we've seen, including possible developments in the marketplace, should impair our ability to meet our view that we will be able to reduce debt by approximately $200 million this year.", "That concludes our prepared remarks and Steve and I will welcome questions.", "", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions).  Our first question does come from Claudia Hueston \u2013 JP Morgan.", "Claudia Hueston \u2013 JP Morgan", "Just a couple of questions.  One, just looking at the Southern Container acquisition, which is nicely accretive in the quarter, as I look at the $0.42 in the December quarter and compare it to the $0.29 of accretion items that you had in the prior quarter, now was most of that due to lower OCC or are there other things going on as we think about that business?", "James Rubright", "", "Primarily OCC pricing.", "Claudia Hueston \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, and do you have much of an outlook for OCC as we think about it through 2009?", "James Rubright", "It\u2019s very weak now but we\u2019re seeing some strengthening on the ports, but I think it\u2019s primarily going to be a function of demand in China and that in turn may be a function of the US demand for imported products.  So I don\u2019t see it strengthening terrifically in the short term, but as you move out beyond three to six months it gets very hard to see.", "", "Claudia Hueston \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, and then if you could just maybe talk a little bit about the bleached board business as well?  I was curious there where things are from a price cost perspective.  You didn\u2019t really comment much on wood costs and if you could provide just any color on what you\u2019re seeing on the cost side there and then also on the pricing side as well. ", "", "James Rubright", "Yes, I think costs for virgin manufactures of all grades are not seeing what we\u2019re seeing on the recycled side.  Our fiber costs into our bleached board mill were up significantly in our fourth quarter over the third quarter.  I\u2019m not confident that there aren\u2019t some just sort of inventory accounting issues moving through there and part of the reason is that in this season the wood comes in wetter and there for your yield is less, so its very hard to compare the actual price per ton based on what you\u2019re paying at the gate.  ", "We haven\u2019t seen gate wood prices increase in the December quarter over the September quarter, and in fact we think we\u2019re going to see them come down, although, as I mentioned yields are down.  So you\u2019re seeing no significant price relief in hardwood, and in our markets, in softwoods although they may soften a little bit.  ", "The other thing is your significant user of caustic soda in the pulping process and unlike all other commodity charts that I\u2019ve seen, which look like Mt. Everest on both sides, this one just looks like the upside, it has not come down.  So those costs are significant and that\u2019s also true with coating chemicals and so forth.  ", "Transportation fuels, on the other hand, and fuel for energy are coming down.  So I think that the bleached board business is not going to perform as well as it would have performed last year because of our low cost structure and our integration it\u2019s going to run full and it\u2019ll be profitable but that business is not benefiting us as the recycling businesses are.", "", "Claudia Hueston \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay thanks, and then just two more.  One, I wondered if you just had a volume number for the specialty paperboard business in the quarter and then if you could just give some tax rate guidance for 2009 that would be helpful.", "James Rubright", "Yes, I don\u2019t have reliable data across specialty paperboards because you\u2019ve got four different product segments there so the number is not that meaningful but it was down significantly, as I say, in the industrial markets and for special reasons in the partition business.  And Steve, regarding the effective tax rate?", "", "Steven Voorhees", "", "Our marginal rate is 37% overall, we do earn R&D tax credits but I\u2019d use between 35% and 36% overall effective rate.", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Our next question does from Christopher Chun \u2013 Deutsche Bank.", "Christopher Chun \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Just wanted to follow-up on the cost difference between production by the craft process as opposed to recycle process.  I think you\u2019re saying that under current conditions the recycled mills have a significant advantage, and if that\u2019s true, I\u2019m wondering if you see any price difference developing or if there\u2019s any customers asking for discounts on recycled container board as opposed to craft.", "James Rubright", "", "Really in the course in the building carton business in all of our mills rather than container board, the answer to that question is they just price differently.  There may be some relationship to the price but you couldn\u2019t correlate them based on what might be happening in the marketplace today.", "In container board I\u2019ve read some of the things that you\u2019ve read about price differentials but we have not seen it.  The quality of our paperboard is such that it simply trades one for one with virgin and the vast majority of it we sell under either through our box plan or trade with outside customers and I can\u2019t contribute to the discounting in the marketplace that we\u2019re seeing for independence that\u2019s necessarily for one reason or another.", "Christopher Chun \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "It seemed like; you as well as other industry players, exercised good discipline in recent months in terms of matching production to demand, but given the fact that margins are very healthy in recycled container board, to what extent do you have any temptation, Jim, to run full and try to take market share in an environment like this?", "James Rubright", "", "Well we\u2019ve been pretty consistent, I think, in our approach to our business and focusing on margin, which may answer your question, but beyond that comment and with respect to our price strategy, as you know, I am unable to do that.", "Christopher Chun \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, that\u2019s fair, but from a [big kicker\u2019s fence], it seems like the behavior of the industry overall is a little bit different from what many of us would have expected given the sharp decline in demand.  It seems like the industry overall is taking a lot more downtime, and I\u2019m wondering if you see any structural factors that would explain that. ", "James Rubright", "Well container board is far more consolidated than it would have been in 2000 or in 1994.  CRB is much more consolidated, so you do have consolidation but we\u2019ve talked about this factor before, the companies are basically run by different people today, and the arithmetic of taking down time versus cutting the prices across all of your production is so compelling that it may be the people who have actually done the math and the conclusion from that is really pretty obvious. ", "Christopher Chun \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, in the marketplace right now there seems to be quite a bit of speculation that in container board, inventories might have dropped pretty sharply in December, given how low production was and we\u2019re getting a lot of data points that at least on a month-over-month basis, shipments in December were okay.  First of all, I\u2019m wondering whether based on Rock-Tenn\u2019s experience, if that would seem likely, and also I\u2019m wondering if that a similar thing might be happening in CRB, because CRB production was very low in December as well and I think you said that folding carton volumes were okay in December.", "James Rubright", "Yes, our folding carton volumes had been okay in December and January.  In CRB there\u2019s so little inventory, that I don\u2019t think that you can really look at it and you don\u2019t\u2019 have the data the way that you have data regarding container board inventories, but I have seen the data that you\u2019re seeing, but given our relatively small size relative to the market, I don\u2019t know that our experience would confirm or really deny what you\u2019re seeing in a much larger marketplace. ", "", "Christopher Chun \u2013 Deutsche Bank", " ", "That\u2019s fair.  All right, thanks for your help.", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Our next question does from Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research.", ".", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "", "A couple of questions, you're bringing your CapEx down, is that now where you\u2019re at, is 80 to 85, is that a normal level and it was just elevated last year because of the Solvay expansion project?", "James Rubright", "Our capital expenditure process Josh, is really a dynamic process where we\u2019re evaluating market opportunities and we\u2019re evaluating customer needs, and then we\u2019re looking at opportunities to reduce cost.  Our long term trend was very heavy investment in the first half of the decade in our businesses which was very necessary and then after that a trend of reducing CapEx.", "I think the current environment has made us cautious about growth projects, which is the primary driver in the reduction of CapEx, but I think as we discussed, if we really went to a maintenance CapEx level, it would be significantly lower than the $85 million that we anticipate spending next year.  ", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "What is that maintenance level?", "James Rubright", "Well it\u2019s very hard to come up with a maintenance level, but I think we could run the business on $40 million.  People would be very unhappy, but we could run it for a long time on $40 to $45 million.", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "", "Okay, that\u2019s a good answer.  Then going back to the box side of the equation, how much of the box price increased increase from the August initiative have you realized to date, and how much did you realize in the fourth quarter?", "James Rubright", "", "The price increase that went through which was the July, August price increase, we realized what we\u2019re going to get substantially.  There may be a tail and some contracts, but that one's substantially through.", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "Would it be more, would the box side be more then $55?", "James Rubright", "", "If we passed it through fully there\u2019s probably some noise.  I don\u2019t know that we significantly increased the recovery in the box plant over the underlying board.", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "Could you give us a sense of how much of that came in the fourth quarter?", "James Rubright", "", "I believe we had it in the fourth quarter.  Sorry my answer wasn\u2019t clear, but I believe it was \u2013 what we had you saw in the fourth quarter, for the full quarter.", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "", "Meaning you had it fully implemented by October 31st and it just rolled over, or how should I interpret what you just said?", "James Rubright", "", "What I\u2019m saying is when it went through in July and August, it went through.  So when you run the quarter from September 30 on, we had substantially all of what we were going to get.", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "", "On the box side?", "James Rubright", "", "Yes.", "", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "", "Oh wow. ", "James Rubright", "", "We have some contracts which will have a tail, but I don\u2019t expect further significant price increase beyond what you saw in the quarter. ", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "", "Okay and that was sort of part of my next question.  What percentage of your business in the boxes is tied to a January 1 or beginning of the year time frame for rolling over?", "James Rubright", "", "It\u2019s not significant, relative to other periods.  The contracts are simply based on when they\u2019re entered into; they\u2019re not keyed typically into a calendar year.", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "", "Okay and just so I\u2019m clear on the question you gave, I think Chris a second ago, on the recycled side of the business, you did not experience discounting like pulp and paper we talked about, because you\u2019re a higher quality board.  Would that be correct?", "James Rubright", "", "Yes.  Chris\u2019 question basically said, \u201cAre we seeing price pressure to reduce our medium, or liner that\u2019s recycled relative to virgin pricing?\u201d  And my answer was that we were not, we may have been seeing pressure but we were not.  Our liner and medium meet specifications of virgin liner and we simply sell it at price equality.", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "Okay, and so then my last question, how are you tied in \u2013are your contracts tied into pulp and paper weak or official board markets those indexes?  And how would we expect that to roll through?", "James Rubright", "", "The majority of our contracts outside of our box plans are with other independent producers under trade agreements, and those simply follow the published indexes, so you\u2019d expect to see it roll through at the mill level, and then the question is how do you recover it in the box plant?", "And our contracts they contain a range of provisions which either provide for either relative immediately full recovery, in some cases will move up or down by a percentage of the increase and in other cases there is some delay.  But substantially all of our business is going to move with the market, regardless of whether it\u2019s under contract or not.", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "", "Okay and so we\u2019ve seen as you said $20 off of liner board, $30 off of medium.  Is that \u2013 that\u2019s enough to trigger the contracts to change?", "", "James Rubright", "", "Yes, typically you\u2019re going to see that pass through relatively rapidly and fully with respect to our business.", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "Great, well thank you very much for your answers.", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions). ", "[break in audio]", "Our next question comes from Bill Hoffman \u2013 UBS.", "Bill Hoffman \u2013 UBS", "", "I wonder if you\u2019d just talk a little about the March quarter here and maybe a little bit from a volume expectation standpoint.  I guess we\u2019re generally thinking that with some of the weakness we saw in the fourth quarter, we kind of mirror those trends in the first quarter, although you indicated some differences like in the display business being Okay in December, o maybe just some general context on an overall basis.", "James Rubright", "", "Bill, January was a weak month relative to typical January\u2019s.  The end of January was showing some strengthening so I don\u2019t think the large quarter overall can be a terrific quarter because I\u2019m not expecting any rebound.  Ultimately, I cannot see our businesses diverging greatly from GDP.", "I mean our consumer products business, our folding carton business, and the bleached board and the recycled mills except for the small piece of business we got in uncoated, primarily are in food, beverage, consumer non-durables, personal care and the like.  And I just don\u2019t understand how that can vary significantly from GDP over the long term.", "Similarly, our containerboard business in the universe of containerboard and corrugated packaging producers has a heavy orientation again to food, beverage, personal care items, home items, other consumer non-durables and consumer products.", "And as I mentioned, the business grew 6% last year.  I\u2019m very familiar with where that grew and it is primarily in personal care, home care items, and again that large percentage of that business which is more then 2/3 of the business, I just don\u2019t see how that can diverge that materially from either GDP where our businesses have typically been GDP minus because of the effect of imports, and there\u2019s lots of data out there, or on their very tight correlation to food and consumer non-durables.", "So my view is I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s going to be February, March, April or whenever, but ultimately whatever is happening to the inventory chain and to household stocking is going to start looking like GDP, and you can have your own view on what GDP is going to do.  I personally don\u2019t consider myself an expert, but most of the stuff that I see suggest that you\u2019re going to see 1 to 2% negative GDP for the year, for the full year.", "And that seems reasonable to us so you\u2019d not expect the consumer packaging business to look like that and the corrugating package business to look a little worse then that, so when it occurs is difficult.  The other thing you\u2019re going to see particularly with consumer packaging business is that as consumers are under pressure, yes they conserve, but as much as conserving they actually tier down their purchases.", "So a purchase of a premium personal care item becomes tiered down to the next, or maybe two levels lower product and while that is not good in terms of dollar GDP growth and it is difficult on a consumer products company who faces that customer shift, I think our paper board mills are pretty indifferent with respect to the product category in terms of tearing that we sell to.  So again I think again that drives us to correlate closer to GDP then perhaps a lot of other businesses.", "But again, I don\u2019t think the March quarter is going to be a great quarter by any means, but our cost structure is going to mediate that, but a great quarter.  I mean if December was a good quarter I guess it\u2019s not a bad quarter, but I think that you won\u2019t see significant growth in that quarter, it might look very much the same and then as you go through the balance of the year economic factors are really going to predominate.", "Bill Hoffman \u2013 UBS", "", "Sure, and that was very helpful.  And a question for Steven, I wonder if you could just help us a little bit with some of the cash movements in the quarter where you paid the cash to the sellers, note was reduced, some of the Solvay bonds were refinanced, and it looks like you rolled enough into the revolver, but I can\u2019t quite tie all the pieces together.  I think there was another additional source of cash or capital from borrowings.", "Steven Voorhees", "We financed, we paid off the $69 million in the 338(h)(10) election and we paid off the Solvay bonds, and between the cash flow from the business and borrowings under the revolver and our receivable securitization, we were able to fund that.

(MWV) Q4 2008 Earnings Call January 28, 2009 10:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Jason Thompson \u2013 Director of Investor Relations", "John A. Luke, Jr. \u2013 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "James Buzzard \u2013 President", "Mark Rajkowski \u2013 Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Analysts", "George Staphos \u2013 Banc of America Securities", "Claudia Hueston \u2013 JP Morgan", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "Peter Ruschmeier \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Richard Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Operator", "Welcome to the MeadWestvaco fourth quarter 2008 results conference call.  (Operator Instructions)  I would like to turn the conference over to your host Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Jason Thompson.  Please go ahead, sir.", "Jason Thompson", "This morning we announced our results before the market opened.  The notification of this morning\u2019s call was broadly disclosed.  Further, this morning\u2019s call is being webcast at mwv.com and slides that accompany this call are available there as well.  I\u2019ll briefly remind you that certain statements we make may be forward-looking and are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties described in our public filings.  Furthermore, contents contain time sensitive information that, although correct today, may change with the passage of time.", "First, a brief recap of the results we reported this morning.  For the fourth quarter, we reported a loss from continuing operations of $16 million or $0.09 per share.  This included after tax restructuring charges of $33 million or $0.19 per share, and those charges related to facility closures, asset write downs and employee separation costs.  For the full year, income from continuing operations was $80 million or $0.46 per share and included after tax restructuring charges of $44 million or $0.26 per share.", "Now here to tell you more about our results for the fourth quarter and full year are John Luke, Chairman and CEO, Jim Buzzard, our President, and Mark Rajkowski, CFO.  I\u2019ll now turn the call over to John.", "John A. Luke, Jr. ", "The weak global economy and resulting difficult operating environment continue to have an impact on MWV\u2019s earnings performance during the fourth quarter, and for that matter the results for the entire year.  Throughout 2008, seeing clear changes in the macro environment we took a number of portative steps to strengthen our financial position and improve our performance.  For that reason, we entered 2009 on sound footing.  While the environment remains difficult, we are confident in our ability to endure the challenges of this period and outperform when economic conditions improve.", "Let me take just a moment to explain why MWV will weather the current storm and emerge as a stronger performing company and attractive investment for more stable periods that are sure to come in the future.", "First, we have taken aggressive proactive steps to solidify our liquidity and financial strength.  Early last year we began efforts to fortify our cash position and our balance sheet allowing us now to capitalize on this strength.  Beyond this, we recently announced and began to implement a series of broad actions to reduce our overhead cost and restructure our manufacturing footprint.  Many of these actions are part of the strategic cost management plan we initiated in mid-2008 that we have now accelerated in order to achieve more savings this year.", "As we recently announced, this includes corporate overhead reductions, which we expect to save $100 million in 2009, and the closure or restructuring of 12 to 14 of our manufacturing facilities, which will save another $25 million in 2009.  In total, these accelerated actions, along with our broader cost program, will save $250 to $300 million on a run rate basis by 2010.  These are important and necessary steps to improve our immediate performance and position MWV for greater future strength.", "Second, we are managing through the current challenges in a way that sharpened our business model and strategies to maximize value for our shareholders.  In taking these steps to improve our performance now, we are enhancing the strategies we\u2019ve put in place to win in the marketplace and gain share in targeted global packaging markets.", "In recent years we have taken several actions to shape our global packaging platform, and during 2008 we took further steps by aligning our commercial resources into strategic business units focused on each of the markets that we\u2019ve targeted for profitable global growth.", "As a critical dimension of this work, we have been proactively conducting a rigorous review of each business including every market, product line and customer to determine what additional actions need to be undertaken to generate appropriate above cost of capital returns for our shareholders.  With this information, we are making explicit determinations about the nature of our participation between those markets that provide the potential for attractive returns and those that no longer do so due to changing competitive dynamics or customer preferences.", "This clearly involves making choices about each of our product lines and manufacturing facilities, as well as about innovation imitative and the direction of our future growth.  This work is directly influencing the strategic cost and restructuring actions we announced.  In every case, these decisions and actions are guided by a singular and very determined focus on maximizing the value we create for our shareholders.", "By actively managing both our cost structure and value creation focus in every business, we will strengthen our focus and performance as a company.  This will support us well during this challenging period while positioning MWV very well as conditions do improve in a position to capitalize on the profitable growth opportunities that exist in targeted global markets.", "I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Jim Buzzard to discuss our operational highlights for the packaging platform and other businesses during the fourth quarter.  Jim.", "James Buzzard", "From an operational standpoint, each of our businesses took actions this year to ensure that we delivered the best possible performance in this difficult economic environment.  Demand was lower virtually across the board due to the global recession, and so we focused intently on managing for cash preserving and increasing prices, reducing costs and improving our productivity.", "As a result, in many markets we outperformed the competition and positioned our businesses to further improve when the economy recovers.  For the first time in more than two years, our sales performance in the quarter decreased when compared to the same period in the prior year.  Continued pricing and mix improvements were not sufficient to counteract the impact of lower demand due to the economy, and while there were many signs of our progress in reducing costs and improving productivity, our overall earnings declined significantly as a result of lower volumes and higher inflation.", "As I provide some additional detail about our performance in each business during the fourth quarter and the year, I\u2019m also going to discuss our view of the current market dynamics in this difficult economy and some of the ongoing strategies and initiatives we are executing to endure this uncertain period and emerge as a stronger competitor when conditions improve.  As usual, you\u2019ll find additional information for all of our business segments in the slide presentation that accompanies this call.", "In the packaging resources segment, the fourth quarter and the entire year followed similar trends, higher sales but lower overall profitability due to input cost inflation.  This business continued to improve pricing across our key paperboard grades, but we are still pushing to catch up to unprecedented inflationary pressures.", "In 2008, we experienced $200 million in increased input costs for the year, including $45 million during the fourth quarter, especially in the areas of energy, raw materials and freight.  Even as oil prices moderated during the fourth quarter, cost for some of our key raw materials and other inputs, including caustic soda and sulfuric acid remained at historically high levels.", "The commercial team have worked hard to drive through price increases with our customers and still hold volume relatively steady, but a 6% overall price and mix improvement during the quarter could not overcome this drastic inflation.  In terms of our paperboard production and shipments, we\u2019ve been doing a good job of managing our system to control inventories and meet demand for the most profitable opportunities.", "Amidst a global economic slowdown, we only saw a small overall decline in volume during the quarter consistent with declining demand for consumer products.  We are gaining share in the aseptic liquid packaging market to commercial printing markets in the U.S. and in bleached board for frozen food applications.", "Overall shipments of bleached paperboard during the quarter increased by 5%, while coated natural kraft volume declined by 12% as we tightly managed inventories.  For both of these grades, backlogs are normal heading into 2009 and we will continue to manage production to market demand signals.  [Inaudible] continued to perform reasonably well, as the high-value, low-cost provider of corrugated solutions in Brazil.", "During the quarter, earnings in this business were negatively impacted by rising costs and the continued depreciation in the Brazilian real.  The packaging resources segment will continue to manage production and control costs, while working to extend gains in several markets for our key paperboard grades.", "In the consumer solutions segment, overall sales and earnings were lower for the forth quarter.  We are starting to see results from our pricing initiatives, especially pass-throughs for resin, as we more than offset input cost inflation during this quarter with pricing and mix improvement.  However, steep declines in demand had an impact on each of our consumer packaging lines of business, especially personal carry and media packaging, as well as the negative impacts on productivity in this segment.", "Let me give you a sense of the commercial drivers in each of our consumer lines of business in the areas on which we are focused to improve our business model and our performance.  Much of the reported weakness in the broader beverage market has come in single-serve, as opposed to the more resilient take-home market for soda, water and beer, as more consumers budgets by eating meals at home.", "During the four quarter, our beverage business performed reasonably well in North America with some increased volume for Coca Cola and Anheuser-Busch InBev for soda and beer multi-packs.  We gained some share in this market with the acquisition of Oracle Packaging and will continue to exploit our advantage in this multi-pack space, including our large glass initiative.", "In addition, we are expanding our presence in emerging markets in Asia and Brazil, for growth trends have slowed, but are still positive.  We've seen some areas of strength in an otherwise declining market for media packaging, including one of the worst holiday retail seasons in recent memory.", "We continue to grow volumes for our Vortex package, as Blu-ray DVD builds momentum as a preferred high-definition format.  We've also built a strong position in the growing videogame packaging segment, both in North America and Europe, and continue to work to replace lost volumes in CDs and DVDs.", "We continue to take advantage of growth trends in healthcare packaging, especially for generic prescription drugs and low cost retail programs.  In particular, our leadership in adherence and compliance packaging, especially Shellpak, is helping us serve the rapidly expanding needs of Wal-Mart's growing $4 drug program.  This product is especially attractive, as it not only improves patient outcomes, but also delivers real productivity benefits for our customers.", "We are currently producing about $4 million Shellpak units per month for ten drugs in Wal-Mart's generic program, and we expect that volume could double by the end of this year.  We are also a leader in advanced pharmaceutical pumps, an increasingly popular application for our customer\u2019s over-the-counter products, and this area of our healthcare business continues to perform well.", "The personal care market is in an unusual situation, as virtually every customer\u2019s question in consumer demand, de-stocking inventory, and postponing launches of new and enhanced products.  The worldwide decline in consumer spending is being felt strongly across this industry, though mass market products are faring slightly better than high-end luxuries, and dispensing solutions are holding up better, compared to sharp declines for folding cartons.", "We have some strong positions, especially in dispensers for the mass market, as it may provide some stability in an otherwise grim environment.  We also know that this market will turn around.  Eventually customers will launch new products, and they'll want to do so with the help of a packaging partner like MWV, that has a strong innovation pipeline, a broad global footprint, and the design capabilities to help their brands stand out.", "We are using the current market situation to organize our personal care business to take advantage of long-term trends that give us an edge on the competition, including sustainable packaging solutions, security packaging alternatives, and airless dispensers.  At the same time, we are moving to exit some unprofitable product lines, consistent with the process John mentioned earlier.", "Similar to personal care, the market for home and garden sprayers and dispensers is experiencing an impact from the slowdown in spending, especially as consumers choose bulk purchases and refillable products over single-use solutions.  We have picked up some share in this market with the purchase of assets from Continental AFA, and our customer-retention rate for this new business has been excellent.", "We continue to improve the business model and operations of the consumer solutions segment with actions to align our commercial resources, focus on the most profitable markets, and increase productivity, including closing and restructuring facilities in our global converting network.", "During the fourth quarter, and the first part of this year, we announced the closure of four consumer solution facilities, two media packaging facilities and two primary packaging facilities for the home and garden and personal care markets.  These decisions were made as a direct result of the focused business review John discussed a few minutes ago, and we've accelerated implementation in order to achieve this savings as soon as possible.", "We will continue with additional actions of this nature through the rest of 2009 to refine our focus on the markets and facilities that create the most value for shareholders.", "Turning to our non-packaging businesses, lower volume and higher input costs combined to drive down results for the consumer office products segment for both the fourth quarter and the year.  We continue to feel the direct impact of reduced consumer spending.  Our North American business saw sales decline as retailers slowed replenishment orders after the back-to-school season, and end-of-year time management and envelope sales slowed along with the rest of the economy.", "Partially offsetting these declines, the business recorded strong productivity gains and our Brazilian business had another good quarter as back-to-school selling was strong.", "The consumer office products business managed its spending and working capital very prudently and delivered solid cash flow in 2008, despite lower earnings.  This business is focused on creating flexibility in its cost structure, as well as from its working capital management to weather the uncertain economic environment that will continue into 2009, as evidenced by the recent announcement that we will close an envelope production facility in Enfield, Connecticut and streamline other operations.", "The specialty chemicals segment was able to deliver year-over-year earnings growth, despite the difficult quarter.  Pricing improved across the board for our carbon and pine chemicals products and fully offset the impact of cost inflation.  This segment also benefited in the quarter from a favorable comparison of inventory counting year-over-year.", "However, this segment was not immune to the economic slowdown as volumes declined compared to last year.  In our activated carbon business, decreased demand from the weakening global automotive market was partially offset with growth from new applications for water and food purification.  And while volumes were lower for all of our performance chemicals, the asphalt additives business is taking advantage of increased government spending on infrastructure, especially in China and the United States.", "The community development and land management segment continues to perform well in a difficult market for real estate.  Proceeds from small-tract land sales in the fourth quarter were $16 million, $2 million more than last year, bringing total proceeds for the year to $57 million.  We recorded an average price per acre during the quarter of roughly $2,200 consistent with our expectations for the year.", "Most of the 33 transactions we closed during the quarter were in Georgia, Alabama and Virginia where per acre values are slightly slower than for our prime holdings in South Carolina.  We will continue to weigh out the market in South Carolina in order to extract maximum value.  Overall, we've had a great deal of success with our sales strategy for small, rural tracts.  We currently have more than 100,000 acres on the market, and we continue to attract interest from our targeted advertising campaign and revamped website.", "We believe we are setting the market for land sales in these areas because we have well-located and high-quality land tracts.  We maintain and share valuable data and information about our land with prospective buyers and we know our customers as neighbors, friends and fellow foresters.", "Now I'd like to turn call over to Mark to discuss some more financial metrics for the fourth quarter.  Mark.", "Mark Rajkowski", "The slowing of the worldwide economy resulted in weaker financial results for the fourth quarter, but we responded with aggressive actions to solidify our cash position and ensure that we entered 2009 in a strong financial position.", "Our businesses did a tremendous job of staying competitive in our markets meeting the demands of our customers and executing on the controllable elements of our business plants, while also managing aggressively for maximum cash generation.", "We are continuing to do the right things to manage through this difficult economy and position our company to outperform when conditions improve.  John and Jim have addressed the strategic and operational elements of our plans.  I\u2019ll discuss some of the financial levers we\u2019re pulling to achieve better near-term results and improve long-term value creation for our shareholders.", "We\u2019ve prioritized cash generation as an operating principle across our businesses and our disciplined approach provided cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter in excess of $175 million.  Improved working capital was the main driver and generated $166 million in the quarter, primarily from the strong collection of receivables and inventory management.", "Our working capital initiatives resulted in a five-day improvement of our cash-to-cash cycle in 2008.  Capital spending in the fourth quarter was $81 million and we paid $40 million in dividends.  By executing on our cash management programs, we entered 2009 with about $550 million in cash and short-term investments, approximately $30 million higher than the end of the third quarter.", "The credit quality of our portfolio is excellent with substantially all cash invested in U.S. Government Treasuries.  We have about a billion dollars of available liquidity and we expect to generate positive free cash flow in 2009, which is cash after funding CapEx and our dividend.", "As you know, we also recently announced a broad set of actions to reduce our overhead costs and restructured our manufacturing footprint.  These steps are part of the ongoing initiatives we began earlier this year to expand our margins and our targeted packaging end-markets by improving our commercial performance and better managing our costs.", "We have thoroughly reviewed our targeted markets, our product lines in each of our manufacturing and converting facilities, with a focus on maximizing value for shareholders by operating as efficiently and as effectively as possible.  We\u2019ve accelerated elements of this program to deliver more immediate savings, including the facility closures and 2,000 position reductions we recently announced.", "Of the 2,000 position reductions, we expect 800 to be completed by the end of the first quarter and the rest by the end of 2009.  The reduction of SG&A in overhead staff and related costs will deliver $100 million in savings this year, beginning in the first quarter.  Facility actions will add another $25 million to savings.  We\u2019ve identified 12 to 14 facility closures and restructurings and we\u2019ve begun to work this with the five facility closures Jim mentioned, four in the consumer solution segment and one envelope plant from our consumer and office product segment.", "By mid-2010, we expect to fully complete our strategic cost program to generate pre-tax run rate savings of $250 to $300 million.  This represents cash savings in the following areas, corporate and business overhead $100 to $140 million, manufacturing and facility rationalization of $75 to $80 million, and global sourcing savings of about $80 million.", "These structural reductions are in addition to the ongoing operational productivity programs taking place across each of our business units.  We expect restructuring charges related to our strategic cost program to be between $200 and $250 million, $29 million was booked in the fourth quarter of 2008, and the remainder will be taken in 2009.", "The majority of the expected restructuring costs will be non-cash asset write-downs, and U.S. employee severance costs that we can fund from the company\u2019s over-funded pension plan without impacting cash reserves or cash flow.", "We are taking these permanent actions to build a more focused and more profitable MWV for the long-term.  Beyond helping to mitigate expected near-term declines in demand, these structural cost reductions will contribute to higher earnings per share and cash flow performance when the economy recovers.", "Now I\u2019ll turn to the outlook.  Given the worsening global economic recession, there is a high degree of uncertainty about forward-looking demand in many of our markets.  In the first quarter, we expect our normal seasonality to be compounded by continued weakness in demand.  While we entered 2009 with low inventory levels in all of our businesses, we\u2019ll continue to manage for cash and match production with demand.", "This will result in lower factory loading levels in the quarter, including expected market down time of up to 40,000 tons across our mill system.  We will aggressively manage our manufacturing cash overhead costs during this time, but we do expect that under-absorbed fixed overhead costs will significantly impact profitability during the first quarter.", "We expect to partially offset the impact of underutilization, with a continued focus on the controllables, including savings from the cost actions we\u2019ve already begun to implement, additional price and mix enhancements, operating productivity improvement and other measures we\u2019re taking to reduce discretionary spending, including pay freezes for salaried employees.", "Lastly, I\u2019ll provide you with 2009 targets for key items, including CapEx, pension income, and depreciation.  CapEx for the full year in 2009 is expected to be around $250 million down from $288 million in 2008.  This includes all the capital required for restructuring our manufacturing footprint.  As we\u2019ve indicated, by narrowing our focus on the highest value opportunities, we\u2019ll be able to reduce overall capital spending levels and continue to make targeted investments to profitably grow our business.  DD&A is forecasted to be approximately $450 million down from $480 million in 2008.", "Pension income is expected to be over $60 million in 2009.  Our team has done a terrific job managing our pension plans during this difficult period.  As a result, we ended the year with a pension surplus of more than $630 million in our U.S. qualified plans representing a funded position of 125%.", "Despite the unprecedented drop in demand we experienced in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ve entered this downturn well-positioned, both competitively and financially.  Our cash flow generation, strong balance sheet, and the focus we have on improving our business model will allow us to not only weather this downturn and take on potential additional stresses, but also outperform on the other side.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to John.", "John A. Luke, Jr.", "Before concluding and turning to your questions, I\u2019ll summarize what you heard today and what it means for MWV going forward.", "We are all operating in a fundamentally different world, including the intense challenges of a global recession.  MWV\u2019s earnings results for the fourth quarter and for 2008 clearly reflect these external pressures.  Through this difficult period, however, we have implemented a broad series of actions to increase our cash reserves and solidify our balance sheet to include the strong benefit of our over-funded pension plan.", "In addition to this financial strength, we\u2019re working aggressively to cut costs and rationalize our manufacturing footprint, both to weather the near-term challenges and support our efforts to advance strategic imperatives, sharpen our commercial focus and business model and improve the value creation profile of our business.", "For all of these reasons, and the benefit of exiting more commoditized businesses in recent years to focus on global markets that provide the potential for profitable growth, we are confident that we\u2019re on the right path.  Mindful of the immediate challenges and economic uncertainties, all of this amounts to opportunity for MWV as a sound reliable partner for customers and as an attractive investment for our shareholders.", "We\u2019ll now be happy to address whatever questions you have this morning.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from George Staphos \u2013 Banc of America.", "George Staphos \u2013 Banc of America Securities", "Bigger picture question maybe first John, realizing that you are taking what you believe to be proactive steps to restructure the business and certainly we'd be constructive on that, how do you guard against being too incremental too marginal in the restructuring action that you're taking now.  From the research that we've done on paper, there's good evidence that during recessions consumers become much more productive in their consumption.  They take it down, but then that behavior's not unlearned when they come back at the recovery, so ultimately how do you right size the office products business in what particularly could be a secular downturn for products that you produce?  And I had a follow one.", "John A. Luke, Jr.", "George, I think that's a great question and let me try to offer a little perspective, and I'll turn to Jim since you also reference consumer and office products.", "First of all, I think it is very important to be proactive as we've said.  You are absolutely right doing so incrementally assuming that things would return back to some semblance of normal, is often a fool's game.  And so we're not just working on the margin, we're looking across the platform insuring that we don't lose sight of where the growth potentials can be around the globe.  But really be sure that we're focused on our capacity to deal thoughtfully with changes that may come in consumer behavior but do so in a way that has a stronger business model to enable us to grow and serve those opportunities that do come along.  Jim?", "James Buzzard", "George, maybe a couple of other thoughts on that and this differs across the various elements of that consumer office products business.  Clearly in the areas of the financial segments for envelopes for example, credit card solicitation and others, we do believe that there's a structural change that will not come back, and that's why we've closed the facility in Enfield and restructured another one and we will continue to look at all those issues.", "In areas like the calendaring and time management business, in past recessions we have seen that that's driven more by job creation and unemployment and when those come back again, the business does snap back.  So what we're already focused on now is making sure managing to the current volumes, we're moving crews out, having temporary layoffs in the facilities and making sure we're producing where demand is, and obviously if as we view these things, if we see more structural change, we'll continue to take additional steps.", "John A. Luke, Jr.", "Right, and let me just follow on that George, before turning to you for the second question you have, just to punctuate I think what both of us are saying, we are not only dealing with a difficult downturn, but we're also dealing with one as we've emphasized in this call today, that has uncertain characteristics and an uncertain duration to it in addition to the potential for very real changes in consumer behavior across the board.", "And I think for that reason the changes that we've announced and continue planning to make or prepared to make, are substantively more than merely on the margin or incremental.  They are ones that are going to really position us much more soundly going forward, particularly with respect to, not only much greater cost efficiency, but the value creation lends in each of our businesses that will support that.", "George Staphos \u2013 Banc of America Securities", "I just maybe respectfully, I\u2019m concerned that past recessions might not be a guide here because you may lose a whole class of the workforce that doesn't come back to time management products, and demographically you'll have a new class that is less anchored to using that type of product going forward.  But in any event, the more minutia types of questions, can you tell us what you're seeing in beverage packaging trends both in North America and outside North America early on in 2009, and what impact are you seeing, if at all, from the dollar on bleached board?", "John A. Luke, Jr.", "George, many thanks, I'll turn it to Jim to share some perspective.", "James Buzzard", "George, in terms of the beverage packaging that I referenced, on the beer side we continue to see things holding relatively steady.  I think that historically we have seen in these markets the take home multi-packs in beer do hold up.  We are seeing declines in North America in the carbonated soft drink business.  I think some of that is the economy and some of it. Frankly, is pricing actions taken by some of the beverage companies that's hitting demand in the multi-packs.", "Europe was a little bit slower to feel the downturn, but we're now experiencing on the beer side, which is the largest part of our business in Europe, that slowed down as well.  So, all in all, I think reasonably good with some signs of softness continuing into 2009.", "In terms of our bleached board business, so far the strengthening of the dollar we don't yet see that as an impact on our volumes.  Obviously there's the translation effect that occurs with that, but our products remain very competitive, especially in the European markets at this point in time.", "John A. Luke, Jr.", "And I would just punctuate that to your earlier question George, the past is hardly prologue, but I think that at current rates the dollar versus euro relative to other currencies as well, historically our business has remained very competitive on a global basis.  It's only been with unusual strengthening that we\u2019d be well ahead of the current levels that we, and no doubt, U.S. manufacturers have seen unusual pressures.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Claudia Hueston - JP Morgan.", "Claudia Hueston \u2013 JP Morgan", "Just a couple of questions about consumer solutions, I was hoping you could give just a little bit of detail on the price cost recovery in that segment, and maybe where you were as you came out of the quarter, and then how you're thinking about both resin price movements and price recovery as they go through the first quarter.  And if you have, how much of that business works on a pass-through that would be helpful as well.", "John A. Luke, Jr.", "Jim, do you want to pick that up?", "James Buzzard", "Sure.  On the plastic side of the consumer solutions business, about 60% of that volume is tied to pass-through, 40% of it we move with open market moves.  What we have seen as you know over the course of 2008 was a dramatic run up in resin pricing.  Some of our contracts are 90-day re-openers, some a little bit longer, some 30-day.  But by and large we spent 2008 behind the curve relative to resin pricing.  That passed itself in the November time frame, and so now we're seeing some advantage on the down side of that.  But by and large we\u2019re able to recapture all the resin price increases, or cost increases rather, through market-based pricing.", "Claudia Hueston \u2013 JP Morgan", "And most of that you should feel as we get to the first quarter because you're still catching up in the fourth, is that right?", "James Buzzard", "That's correct.", "Claudia Hueston \u2013 JP Morgan", "Then just also within that segment, just given the acquisitions and restructuring over the last couple of years, I was wondering if it's possible just to get a breakdown of the major product categories and what they represent as maybe a percentage of sales, or just sort of order of magnitude size at this point just given some of the actions you've taken?", "Mark Rajkowski", "Claudia, this is Mark.  A big part of our consumer solutions group is our beverage business.  That is a substantial portion of our revenues in that segment.  Media is still a fairly substantial portion of our segment revenues as well.  As we've said that's a business that is slightly north of $500 million of sales, beverage is approximately $1 billion of sales.", "We have a personal care business that includes folding carton as well as plastic products from our Calmar business that is in the neighborhood of $400 million business.  Healthcare is again a combination of folding carton and pumps from our Calmar business and that's closer to a $200 million business.  And then we've got tobacco, which is slightly less than $300 million.  And then we've got a home and garden business that's about $250,000, so that's kind of the run down for that segment in terms of revenues.", "Claudia Houston - JP Morgan", "Finally, given the strength of the balance sheet and the relatively good outlook for cash, could you maybe just talk about your priorities for your cash and how you prioritize the dividend and debt reduction and how you're thinking about acquisitions and that sort of stuff?", "John A. Luke, Jr.", "Let me offer just a couple of high level thoughts and I'll ask Mark to supplement.  I think as we move through this period for all the reasons that we emphasized in our prepared comments, we are dealing with an uncertain period one that will be of uncertain duration and tenor.  And our focus is to keep our cash reserves full where we can with plans that we have and intend to execute to enrich those reserves and those remain priorities along with maintaining other elements of our financial strength.", "You mentioned the dividend and you'll note that our board reinforced that this week with a positive vote.  Debt reduction is as prudent, always attractive, but that has to be weighed in the moment against the value of cash preservation.  So, Mark?", "Mark Rajkowski", "I think that's well said.  We're going to work really hard this year.  We've got a lot of actions underway in terms of cost reductions.  We think we can take more cash out of the balance sheet around working capital and our focus is through our operating cash flow to be able to fund our CapEx as well as the dividend.  And as John said, I think given what is a very, very uncertain and fuzzy next 12 plus months, I think hanging on and preserving the cash that we have right now makes a lot of sense.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Gail Glazerman - UBS.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Maybe just following up on Claudia's question for a minute, last quarter you made some small [inaudible] acquisitions.  I'm just wondering if from, I guess, distressed properties, have you seen any more opportunities like that or going forward with the opportunity really just be taking share from producers that are in stress?", "John A. Luke, Jr.", "I think that's a great question, Gail.  We're not actively looking and frankly I'm not aware of any that have come along that have caught our fancy.  I think that in this macro environment in this industry as with virtually every other industry, such defined distress assets will be available probably in an increasing abundance.  But our priority is on financial strength, furthering that financial strength and executing the significant programs we have very much on our plate right now, and that remains our priority.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Switching to demand a little bit, two things there, is there anything specific you can talk about in bleached board that would explain why that seems to still be showing year-over-year growth while so much of the rest of the product areas in the economy in general is weaker.  Is that really share gains on your part, or are the markets really still growing?  And also if you could talk a little bit about, I guess, sequential trends you saw moving through the fourth quarter and what that implies for 2009.", "John A. Luke, Jr.", "I'll turn to Jim to offer some perspectives on that.", "James Buzzard", "On the demand side with bleached board, I think clearly in selected markets there were main strengths with tobacco markets.  Also the aseptic markets continue to show global growth.  Food service is strong as well.  Part of what helps us clearly is the global reach that we have.  So we do have a strong presence in Asia and other growing parts of the world.", "Having said that, there are certain parts of the business that throughout the quarter we saw begin to decline.  So our commercial print business sequentially began to show some weakness and, frankly, we saw some of the journal packaging applications as well.  But we've seen, as I'm sure you have, the unmade orders backlog beginning November begin to decline.  So we are seeing some moderation in those markets in total.", "But we would counter that by saying that where we are today is about where things were back in 2007.  So we will continue to closely monitor our demand side and we'll manage the business against that.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Obviously not all input costs have fallen and on the year-on-year basis you're still in some areas chasing that.  But can you talk a little bit about the sequential cost trends overall moving from the third quarter into the fourth quarter?", "James Buzzard", "Sure, Gail.  What we saw from Q3 to Q4, we didn't see a lot of real significant movement down as we began the quarter.  So as I said in my comments, certainly in the areas like freight, caustic soda, sulfuric acid, latex, our outside electrical purchases and others, we continue to be subjected to strong inflation pressures.  Those are beginning to moderate.  So we are working hard through our sourcing group to begin to move in those areas.  But we expect to see, again as I referenced, fairly significant inflation in Q1.  What we do see, though, as I referenced, is beginning to see the moderation and as we move throughout 2009, we expect to see that trend turn the other way for us.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Could you just remind us of your hedging position right now in terms of natural gas?", "James Buzzard", "Gail, we're slightly less than 60% hedged going into 2009.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "I had a couple questions.  John, I was curious on your capital spending $250 million, certainly a very low number from historical standards.  How long do you think you might be able to sustain that level without impacting the business?", "John A. Luke, Jr.", "Pete, we have obviously rationed it back, but I think as we have moved forward over the last several years we've found much more efficient ways to spend and engineer solutions in our business.  And so we are not going to put the company at an unsustainable capital spend level, and we think this is a level that supports the business as is needed and could be sustained if this downturn continues.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Maybe a question for Jim on the inflation question, I know you have a lot of puts and takes and lags on when things pass through, but if you had $200 million cost inflation in 2008 based on the trends you see today, what kind of delta do you think you might see in '09?", "James Buzzard", "Peter, at this point I think it's really too early for me to tell.  As I said, we're working hard in this area.  We don\u2019t have a picture as to where things are going to wind up.  Clearly we see a rapid deceleration, but I would say that whether it's through inventories or lags through the first quarter, we will continue to be impacted by heavy inflation.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "And quick question for Mark, if I could, Mark, do you have a preliminary estimate on the over-funded pension situation?  How that may be finalizing for 2008?", "Mark Rajkowski", "Yes.  We're going to end the year at 125% over-funded, Peter.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "So what is that - what kind of balance is that?", "Mark Rajkowski", "That's well over $600 million.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "And then just lastly maybe for John, I'm curious we've seen as recently as two weeks ago continued interest in timber transactions very high price points and we know you've got some makers on the block, but the question really is does it make sense to consider, at least in this environment, accelerating some of those bulk timber sales given the very strong appetite and given that, at least in my opinion, your timber land is worth a large percentage of your market cap and you could potentially financial engineer with that at a very opportune time.", "John A. Luke, Jr.", "Pete, I think that's a question that certainly lets us build on the points that Jim made in his comments and that is we do have strong assets and high quality assets we have got a lot of things going on that are good within that business today.  You will see some continued select transactions.  Our cash position, overall financial strength lets us select those very, very prudentially so that we can capitalize on those that even by historic measures are very attractive and lucrative.  And as those come along and we can capitalize on them we will continue to build those revenues, but we are not going to engage in any fire sale activity that you would expect are driven in part by the appetite of some buyers in this credit market.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research..", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Following up really in the vein of the prior question, do you at this point have a share repurchase authorization still outstanding?", "John A. Luke, Jr", "Yes we do.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "And how much is left on that?", "John A. Luke, Jr", "I think it\u2019s roughly 2.5 million shares.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "I apologize if you already mentioned this.  Did you buy back anything in the fourth quarter?", "John A. Luke, Jr", "We did not.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "On the $550 million of cash on the balance sheet, how much of that is in the U.S. and really, I guess the point of the question is, how much cash do you think you need to carry on the balance sheet as an ongoing entity?", "John A. Luke, Jr", "Well more than half of that cash is in the U.S., Mark, and certainly the answer to the last part of the question probably answer that differently today than I would have 12 months ago, I think in a normal environment there are working capital needs.  Some capital needs particularly in the first half of the year for us given the cyclical, or I should say seasonal nature of our business and you could think of that as roughly being a couple hundred million dollars.", "So with conditions the way they are, I think given some of that uncertainty we think it\u2019s prudent to have higher levels of cash balances.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "I guess what I\u2019m just trying to understand is that not that long ago you sold a big chunk of assets and bought back stock with a portion of that.  And as you mentioned, John, you certainly don\u2019t want to be doing fire sales in this type of environment, but given that your stock is a lot lower doesn\u2019t the economics give you room to actually sell things at a lower price and it work better for you because you can buy your stock back at a much lower level?", "How does that affect your thinking as you look at potential arbitrage opportunities with regards to unlocking value?", "John A. Luke, Jr", "Mark, you can be sure that you\u2019re not the first person to raise that question and it\u2019s one that out of respect for those who are raising it that as well as just good business prudence that we evaluate on a continuing basis.", "At this stage of the game there has been no clear evidence of sound economic value in our analytics to point to a clear benefit from such an arbitrage.  We continue to evaluate these things and again weighing them against the backdrop, as we\u2019ve reinforced this morning, of the benefits of holding onto cash just for overall security and financial prudence in today\u2019s uncertain world as well.", "James Buzzard", "Yeah.  Mark what you\u2019re suggesting certainly we\u2019re taking a hard look at it.  It would appear to make sense in theory but when the cash is gone it\u2019s gone and I certainly like to see a little bit of light at the other end of this tunnel as we work through what is just a probably one of the most unsettled and most distressed periods in this country\u2019s economic history.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "I guess the question was also linked though to the potential that you might have some assets that actually could still be monetized.  Maybe not at as high prices as they could have been six months ago, but at still pretty high prices so that you wouldn\u2019t actually even have to weaken your financial position in going through this strategy.", "John A. Luke, Jr", "Well, my response would be the same.  That would still represent potential cash reserves that we may want to get our hands on in and use in an alternative fashion beyond either buying back stock or debt.", "James Buzzard", "But I think you raised a good prompt and we\u2019ll just continue to evaluate the question as we have.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "On the pension, was there any meaningful change on your discount rate and what was planned performance in \u201808?", "John A. Luke, Jr", "We lowered our discount rate to 6.25 from 6.5 so that did have the effect of increasing our liabilities and our performance I think year-to-date in the pension plan was roughly 10%, down 10%.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs.", "Richard Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Just wanted to focus a little bit maybe on the cost cutting restructuring that you\u2019re doing the $125 million, what is sort of the net benefit that you would anticipate in 2009, or perhaps another way to ask it is, what kind of transition costs might there be and/or what\u2019s sort of the normal inflation costs that you\u2019d expect in your business?", "John A. Luke, Jr", "Let me take a shot of that one, Rick.  Our expectations is that the $100 million of SG&A in overhead reductions is just that.  We\u2019re looking to taking $100 million of our overhead cost out net of inflation, inflation being salaries, benefits and things to that nature.  In terms of the manufacturing capacity rationalization, again, those are going to be real cost that comes out net of some of that transition, moving equipment some product lines, re-staffing, getting lines up and running.", "Richard Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And do those transition costs sort of occur through the first half of \u201909?", "John A. Luke, Jr", "Those transition costs will occur as we actually close and move product, if we are moving product, from each of the facilities.  So that will take place over the course of the year.", "Richard Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Then just shifting to a bigger picture question for John, maybe following up a bit on Mark Weintraub's question, as you look at the business and accelerated this restricting, how do the consumer and office product and specialty chemicals businesses fit into the strategy of being a global packaging company?", "John A. Luke, Jr", "Rick, again, as we\u2019ve talked about that in the past I think that we have clear distinct areas of focus and profitable growth opportunities in the packaging space.  We\u2019ve got excellent teams leading excellent businesses in consumer office products and in specialty chemicals.", "Good cross linkages in terms of business model idea exchange innovation, go to market strategy and so they are positive contributors not only to our thinking about what we can continue to do in our packaging business, but they are positive and welcome contributors to our company\u2019s overall financial performance.", "Operator", "With that, ladies and gentlemen, we turn the conference back to Mr. Jason Thompson for closing remarks.", "Jason Thompson", "Thanks everyone for joining us and, Alex, please give out the replay information.  Good bye.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentleman, this conference will be available for replay after 12 pm today until February the 28th at midnight.

Rubright - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Analysts", "Claudia Shank Hueston - JPMorgan", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Joshua Zaret - Longbow Research", "Chip Dillon - Credit Suisse", "Operator", "Good morning. My name is Trey and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Rock-Tenn's Second Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder ladies and gentlemen, this call is being recorded today, April 28, 2009. (Operator Instructions). Thank you.", "Your speakers for today's call are Mr. John Stakel, Vice President, Treasurer, Mr. Steven Voorhees, Chief Financial Officer, and Mr. James A. Rubright, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Stakel, you may begin your conference.", "John D Stakel", "Thank you, Trey and welcome to Rock-Tenn's fiscal 2009 second quarter earnings conference call. I'm John Stakel, Vice President, Treasurer of Rock-Tenn. Joining me are Jim Rubright, CEO, and Steve Voorhees, CFO.", "During the course of the conference call, we may make statements that are not historical in nature and may involve forward-looking statements within the meaning of Federal Securities Laws.", "For example, statements regarding our planned expectations, estimates, and beliefs related to future events, or forward-looking statements, which may involve a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control and that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed.", "Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties is contained in the filings that we made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These filings include the companies include the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year-ended September 30, 2008 and the Form 10-Q filed for the quarter-ended December 31, 2008.", "During the call, we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are contained in the second quarter press release, which is available on Rock-Tenn's website at rocktenn.com.", "With that out of the way I will turn the call over to Steve", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Thanks John. Rock-Tenn reported net income of 37.4 million or $0.97 per share, as compared to 17.1 million or $0.45 per share in the March quarter of last year.", "Rock-Tenn incurred 3.2 million of pre-tax restructuring costs, including 0.8 million of integration expenses related to the Southern Container acquisition. 0.9 million primarily related to the closer of RTS Packaging plant located in Litchfield, Illinois. And the final quarter of acquisition related deferred compensation our ESU expenses of 1.4 million.", "These restructuring expenses reduced by 0.3 million or the 35% minority interest in the RTS Packaging joint-venture, net to 2.9 million or $0.05 per share after-tax.", "After those $0.05 adjustment, Rock-Tenn recorded $1.02 an adjusted EPS, a $0.36 improvement over the $0.66 in adjusted EPS reported last year.", "Rock-Tenn reported sales of 676 million in the March quarter, a decrease of 10 million from the March quarter of last year. Corrugated Packaging sales increased 65 million over last year, a direct result of owing Southern Container for three months this year as compared to only one month last year.", "Overall selling prices increased 2 to 3% on average over the last year in all of our businesses, except the Recycled Fiber business where prices declined by 47%.", "Overall volumes declined by about 10% on average roughly 5 to 6% in our Consumer Packaging business and in the 12 to 15% range for the other businesses.", "On a sequential quarterly basis, Rock-Tenn's sales declined by 27 million, down 4% versus the December quarter. Corrugated Packaging sales declined by the same 27 million, a 13% reduction from the December quarter, primarily due to the 33,000 ton decline in containerboard mill production to match reduced customer demands.", "And the Consumer Packaging segment, folding carton volumes were flat and coated recycled board volumes increased 3% versus the December quarter.", "The 6 million, a 1.6% decline in Consumer Packaging segment sales was primarily due to lower sales volume of rich paperboard and lower pricing of market pulp.", "Merchandising Displays sales increased by 8 million as compared to the December quarter. For specialty paperboard products, a 5 million reduction in sales was due to a decline in sales prices in the Recycled Fiber business.", "Recycled Fiber pricing declined significantly during the quarter. For Chicago and back for SEC (ph) was $30 per ton on average in the quarter, down $18 per ton from the December quarter, and $83 per ton from the March quarter of last year.", "The closing price of the NYMEX natural gas contract averaged $4.94 per MMbtu during the quarter. This is down $2 from the December quarter and about $3 from the March quarter of last year. The April contract closed at $3.53 and the May contract recently at $3.25 closes later today.", "July to October is the time of the year when gas prices can increase due to hurricanes and our extreme hot weather. We've got 20% of our July to October gas needs prices slightly over $4 per MMbtu. Without speculating on future gas prices, what we do when we see attractive pricing at to reduce our full exposure to weather driven winter and hurricane driven fall price spikes as we've done this year.", "Rock-Tenn segment income of 96.7 million for the March quarter increased sequentially 6.7 million from the December quarter. Improvements in operating efficiency and lower pricing for fiber and energy is more than offset lower volumes, which particularly affected our Corrugated Packaging segment, or segment income declined by 9 million or 18%.", "Rock-Tenn segment income for March increased by 39 million over the March quarter of last year, primarily due to the Southern Container acquisition for which we included only one month of operating results last year.", "The Southern Container acquisition added approximately $0.29 per share to earnings for the quarter, and $1.23 per share to earnings for the 13 months, since we closed the transaction in March of 2008.", "At the time of the acquisition, we anticipated $10 million in annual synergies and subsequently raised that number to 15 million. We achieved an annual synergy run rate of 16 million during the March quarter. We had spent 10 million since the acquisition to integrate Southern Container and also achieve these annual synergies.", "The integration of Southern Container is substantially complete. We do not anticipate additional acquisition, integration expenses in future quarters.", "Non-allocated expenses were 8.9 million in the quarter, slightly higher than normal due to certain compensation related accruals. We expect non-allocated expenses to run at about $8 million per quarter.", "Rock-Tenn reduced working capital as defined by account receivable plus inventory plus accounts payable by 21 million in the quarter. For the year, working capital was about 12.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter were 17 million below depreciation and amortization of 37.3 million. We expect approximately 80 million of capital expenditures for fiscal year 2009 below our current annual of depreciation and amortization expense run rate of approximately 150 million.", "For the three months ending March 2009, Credit Agreement EBITDA was 124 million. For the 12 months ending March 2009, Credit Agreement EBITDA was 469 million, equating to an EBITDA margin of 18% in the quarter and 16% for the year. This strong operating performance combined with capital expenditures about $70 million loss per year when depreciation creates very strong free cash flow that we have used to pay down debt.", "Rock-Tenn reduced net debt during the quarter by 93 million. We have reduced net debt by 276 million for the 12 months since March 2008, when we acquired Southern Container.", "Rock-Tenn's debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio has declined from 12.2 times, at the time we closed the Southern Container acquisition to 3.25 times at March 31, 2009.", "The current portion of long-term debt at the end of March was 183 million. The 183 million includes 124 million from the receivables securitization facility that extents through September 1 of this year and 59 million that is primarily amortization of the term loans under our senior credit facility.", "We expect to renew our receivable securitization facility during the June quarter. We expect the new facility to precise in the 140 to $150 million range. Of the 1.5 billion in debt as of March 31, fixed interest rates declined 1.1 billion or 71% of the total, consistent with our fixed rate target of 70%.", "Floating interest rates to approximately 400 million or 29% of the total. Of the 400 million in floating rate debt about 200 million as a LIBOR's lower of 3%. At the end of the quarter, we had borrowed 57 million under our 450 million revolving credit facility.", "Rock-Tenn had approximately 370 million in availability under our credit facilities as of the end of March. We continue to have very good liquidity for our business.", "Jim will now discuss our operating results and outlook. Jim.", "James A. Rubright", "Thank you, Steve. As Steve described, our employees continue to deliver outstanding results in a very challenging environment. The principle challenge we faced of course was volume declines across our businesses. And I'll speak more about that subsequently in the call.", "And the second was pricing pressure, particularly in containerboard or in Corrugated Packaging. And we saw that pricing pressure both were independence and several integrated containerboard producers.", "Pricing for coated recycled paperboard was better than corrugated as industry operating rate stayed in the mid 90s for the quarter, reporting the published industry data. And although pricing is down somewhat from its peek, during the quarter we renewed a number of long-term contracts with folding carton customers that had embedded paperboard price increases in them over the levels of the contracts established three and four years ago.", "These paperboard industry volumes were reported averaging below 80%, 77.5% actually year-to-date. But market pricing stayed firm. And high input cost for fiber and caustic soda continued through most of the quarter.", "The strategy across our businesses has been the match production to customer demand. And we actually have executed our strategy. We've reduced containerboard operating rates to 80% during the quarter and coated recycled paperboard operating rates to about 90%.", "Our bleached paperboard mill did run full during the quarter, but as we stated in the past, because of our ability to internalize production, because of our very large short position in bleached paperboard, and we can maintain full operating rates at our bleached paperboard mill as we did during the quarter.", "The 7000 ton decline in bleached paperboard ton shift was caused by a drawdown in inventory during the earlier period, which we expect related to customers anticipating January contractual price increases. And then we saw a corresponding inventory build during the current March quarter.", "Realized pricing for all grades for us with the exception of bleached paperboard declined over the quarter.", "Based on recent published index prices, and our contractual deferrals of price increase and decrease implementation, we expect to see some continued reduced realized prices for our recycled grades over the next quarter.", "As many of you may have seen, we received our certification to receive the tax credit available until the end of the year for burning black liquor. Since we produced primarily recycled grades, this windfall is proportionately less for us and for many of our integrated competitors.", "However, we would expect our biofuel tax credits to total about 75 million through the end of the calendar year from our 400,000 ton bleached board mill in Demopolis, Alabama.", "There are number of positive factors however that will influence the balance of our year. First, we saw an increase in box plant volumes in March over the January, February period. And April month to-date box plant were up about % over the rate of February, March.", "Now two months of data is only that. But if that data continues or improves, we will clearly look back and see the end of February and early March as the market bottomed that we're moving up from. Fully carton coated recycled paperboard and bleached paperboard demand appeared to be continuing about flat, but they never declined as much as corrugated box volumes.", "Folding carton industry volumes according to published data being of about 5% year-to-date.", "I should note that we will take our major maintenance outage in our bleached board mill this quarter, mill went down in early April and it is now back-up in a full production. And this outage will reduce our quarter's earnings compared to the annual run rate.", "As we have mentioned, we have moved from a 12 month to an 18 month major outage schedule, and we did that successfully this quarter. As a result, every third year there will be not be a major maintenance outing in next year fiscal 2010 is that year.", "Another favorable factor influencing us is continuing reduction or new alteration in the high cost over the last few years. Recycled Fiber and natural gas cost continued to be low compared to last year, Steve gave you the data. But significantly for us recently virgin fiber and caustic soda prices have begun to ease as well.", "Our full review, we're seeing continuing low input costs, would possibly have modest increase in Recycled Fiber costs later in the year. And we also see stable to increasing demand and with respect to containerboard and possibly recycled paperboards and further modest price erosion. And then continuing strong pricing for bleached paperboard.", "I'd like to continue with some specific comments regarding our business unit before concluding. Our Southern Container acquisition continues to outperform our expectations in our commitment.", "$0.29 per share accretion in the quarter alone and the $1.18 of accretion for the first full year after the acquisition, which incidentally is about twice the size of the accretion from the Gulf States acquisition in 2005. Within the Southern Container acquisition was about twice the size of the Gulf States acquisition.", "The 276 million in debt reduction over the last four quarters plus the 15 million in dividends, which represents about $7.60 of free cash flow generation per share in a 12 month period, substantially exceeded our most aggressive acquisition cases.", "In the corrugated segments EBITDA of 30% of sales in the quarter is much higher than the 26% EBITDA for Southern Container alone prior to the acquisition.", "Part of the reason for this improvement is the 16 million in synergies we've achieved, compared to the 10 million initial commitment. We made when we announced the transaction.", "But the greatest part is the very low cost positions of the Solvay mill and the great job our employees have done to control production costs, running the substantially reduced volume.", "In addition, our box plants have also done well, they remained profitable in this reduced volume environment. And our rapid corrugated plants actually increased operating income 98% over the 2008 quarter, as we continue to prove out the value, this new low cost, very high quality graphics printing technology we've brought to the marketplace.", "Our core folding carton business performed very well, with first half sales down only 3.6% compared to industry average declines of 4.8%. Segment return on sales was 4.5%, and although slightly below our 5% target, it's still very strong given the volume environment in the marketplace.", "And also significantly, we renewed a very substantial part of our term contract business in the first half of this year. And we had a net gain of customer mandates that will continue our trend to modest but sustained share growth.", "Despite sales volumes of $83 million in the quarter, we're down compared to the blow out quarter we had last year. But the annualized sales base of 330 million is not troubling in relation to the full year 2008 sales of 350 million, given what we expected and logically make sense that there would have been relatively few product launches in the March quarter. And the extent to which this business depends upon and profits very well from new product introductions in its best quarters.", "So displays, our best view for the balance of the year, sales will increase to at least the pace of 2008 based on the activity level we see right now.", "Segment income of 9.7 million is pretty much on a seasonally adjusted pace of last year's total 42 million and return on sales of 12% is also consistent with our expectations for this business.", "Our specialty paperboard group also performed well in the quarter, generating segment income of 6.2 million and EBITDA of 8.2 million on sales of 70 million.", "Segment income was down 5% and sales were down 30%, and yet we maintain those margins. Published pricing for specialty paperboard is now down $60 per ton from its December 2008 quarter peak, although Recycled Fiber input cost continue to be off more than that.", "In January and February, we saw major declines in beverage glass production which affected our specialty paperboard volumes, but we've been advised to expect those volume declines by our customers who took a number of major outages. What we've seen in the last six weeks, volumes have returned to much more normal levels. And we expect that to continue for the balance of the year.", "That's overall, we see volume trends in our businesses at or either stable or improving. As in Corrugated Packaging and Displays, and a continuation of the favorable cost environment particularly for Recycled Fiber or natural gas and caustic soda, all major input costs.", "As I mentioned virgin fiber prices also finally moves in our favor in recent weeks. And we think that should improve the results at our bleached board mill as should probably likely increases in pulp pricing which we think are coming off that market bottom.", "So, accordingly if current market conditions continue, and we would expect to continue to generate strong cash flows, well in excess of our Southern Container acquisition related commitment of $200 million per year.", "With the conclusion of those prepared comments, operator, Steve and I'll respond to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, we're ready to begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). The first questions does come from Claudia Hueston of JPMorgan, your line is open.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "Hi, thanks very much. Good morning.", "Steven Voorhees", "Good morning.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "I was hoping you could put just a little bit more color around the trends you're seeing in corrugated, and the pickup that you noted in March and April, are there any particular pockets of strength or weakness in anyway to maybe, what gives you confidence I guess it's more than just a little bit of a seasonal pickup?", "Steven Voorhees", "Well, Claudia what was your GDP down in the quarter?", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "Yeah.", "Steven Voorhees", "Exactly. So, if corrugated box volumes are down three times GDP in -- from mid-November to mid-March, I don't think that's sustainable. So the pickup we've seen has been across our customer base, it's not one particular sector or segment of the industry.", "And so it's fairly broad based and an 8% increase relative to say six week or even two to three months period of volume is a significant difference, it feels different. And so that's why I think that we're very likely had come off of the bottom. A, I think the bottom was unsustainably low and I think I've been pretty consistent expressing that view relative to underlying changes in GDP and unemployment.", "So that's the first reason and then the second is like I said six weeks is not a season, but six weeks is not an insignificant period of time.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "Yeah. And as you talk to customers both in corrugated and cost to other businesses, do you feel that confidence has improved or there visibility is starting to improve. I remember last quarter, you couldn't really give much color on displays but it sounds like you've got a better sense now?", "Steven Voorhees", "Yes, I do feel more confident about the marketplace from -- it's more customer activity though and what we see in terms of backlog then it would necessarily be there views of the marketplace going forward.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "And then just on the folding carton side, it seems like you obviously have been gaining your volumes are better than the industry. Do you think that's more a fraction of share gains or is it your customer base there that's driving that?", "Steven Voorhees", "Well, several of our large customers are themselves gaining share in the marketplace. And so picking the right customer is really nice thing we've done. But we continue to pick off pieces of business that we -- that fit us very well. And so we definitely are not loosing share and we're gaining share in very specifically targeted places where our cost structure simply fits the product and enable us to meet our return expectations.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then just finally your debts obviously coming down very fast and are there really good cash flow quarter, is debt reductions still your sort of main priority or how are you thinking about cash going forward?", "Steven Voorhees", "Yes. We think that for the next 12 months, we're very focused on debt reduction. There are -- there will be opportunities in the marketplace. But, right now we think that we'd like to continue to move our debt back into our target range of below three times debt to EBITDA. And that is our initial focus.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then just finally, I don't know if you have any comment on how you'll do the accounting act for the alternative fuel credit, I don't know if given out any comment that you might be able to share.", "James A. Rubright", "Well, we have given a lot of thoughts and we think that it will not come into the tax line. It actually it'll be shown as an operating revenue because it's an excise tax rebate.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Christopher Chun of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Yeah, thanks. Good morning, guys.", "James A. Rubright", "Good morning. How are you Christopher?", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Good. Thanks. Just wanted to ask a couple of questions about pricing?", "James A. Rubright", "Yeah.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "First on the board side, you mentioned that this quarter is probably going to see lower prices at least on the recycle side. And I was wondering if you could tell us on average, where prices are today relative to last quarter's average?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, let me -- you've got the date on the published index pricing.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Sure.", "James A. Rubright", "Good, for example; the biggest differential is in specialty paperboard, which is down about $60 a ton. And it ranges to 45 for certain grades to zero to bleach board. The reason I've said we'll see lower pricing is not because I expect the index themselves become down, because I'm really not commenting on the direction of the index. Rather there is a price lag or time lag between the point of time that an index publishes and when we see the pricing.", "So that lag has a normal distribution I guess that will stretch out for several quarters, and maybe as much as a fiscal year based on contractual adjustments. And we've just passed through a calendar year, which is often significant for purposes of contract either that had mid-year or calendar year adjustments. So, that's really why as to we'll see some reduced realized pricing not market price changes.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Right. Can you talk about how long that might is on average? And if we wanted to get a sense of, let's say where drop kind of realizations in April are. I mean, how much further back should we go in looking at the index prices, and say, trying to get a sense of that?", "James A. Rubright", "Yeah, I don't have that data that I can tell you. I can't give you a specific answer, but it's not that much. The tail is long because of some of the contractual provisions but, particularly, in containable, you realize that immediately. So we take container board and bleach board half of our production put in the spot terms that are at market today.", "So, you're going to end up with something like 60 to 65% of your volume as the Egyptian venture will pass through pricing that is going to be pretty immediate. And then a reminder has a tail that I think it can run out as much as 12 months.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Yeah, okay. And then how about on the converted product side. Do you expect there to be a lag there between the prices for those products relative the paper prices?", "James A. Rubright", "Yes, I was really speaking of it on an integrated basis Chris. I was saying, if you look at all of our turns, whether we sell them externally or whether sell them through as converted product that data I was giving you, looked that the entire integrated sales of both paperboard and converted products.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Yeah, okay. And then you mentioned, an average at the mark plus.", "James A. Rubright", "Yes.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Can you quantify the likely impact of that on this quarter?", "James A. Rubright", "Yeah, I think it's going to be more than $0.05 per share subroutine.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then I think you talked a little bit about this already. But can you talk about, did quarter-over-quarter decline and the tons are out of ... this quarter? Was that just strictly a market downtime or was it, was there other issues is going on?", "James A. Rubright", "No, we made a decision that we are not going to be the one taking the market down. And so we ran the contractual demand.", "Christopher Chun - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, very good. I'll go ahead, and turn it over.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our next question does come from Joshua Zaret of Longbow Research. Your line is open.", "Joshua Zaret - Longbow Research", "Thank you. A couple of questions; first on OCC pricing, obviously it's come off the bottom in last couple of months, have you seen any weakness starting to reappear again?", "James A. Rubright", "Yes, we didn't agree with some of the publication increases particularly in the northeast. So we think actually the publications has got ahead of the actual marketplace and we think the market is at least as soft as the indexes would indicate, and probably a little softer. The marketplace index is geographically are going to vary in their movement because of their relation to the exportability as a Recycled Fiber. And there is activity at the ports, although at prices that justify the transportation differential from the major Mid-Western markets after coast. But actually, I think, the market is little east as soft as the published indexes are indicating.", "Joshua Zaret - Longbow Research", "Okay. You sort of answered my next question and that had to do with -- is you're trained (ph) for OCC away from the port? In other words, obviously, you pay in less even though you are in New York, you have barrier in terms of prices from the ports?", "James A. Rubright", "Yes, we're in New York, we're in Syracuse (ph) within a $15 freight circle, there are 55 million people. So there's a tremendous recycle fiber market, for the Syracuse (ph) Mill, including markets that are west to Syracuse and the freight differential simply from the Syracuse market itself up to the port more than justifies the price differential that exist today. So there shouldn't be that significant effect from the current market place on that mill. And then if you look at the rest of our production, we're pretty far away from the coast.", "Joshua Zaret - Longbow Research", "Got you. Second question, can you tell us how much caustic soda you consume a year?", "James A. Rubright", "No.", "Joshua Zaret - Longbow Research", "Okay.", "James A. Rubright", "I'll ask you to come back in...", "Joshua Zaret - Longbow Research", "Okay, that'll be very helpful if the cost have started to come down.", "James A. Rubright", "Still don't know, but we'll just get back to you.", "Joshua Zaret - Longbow Research", "Great, that will be helpful. And third, can you sort of give us a feel for your recycled ... quarter recycle board and each board trending backlogs over the, let's say, last three and a half months?", "James A. Rubright", "Yeah, there really has not been a significant change, be it for mill backlog and industry backlogs and unmade order date of the day we published are not strong and they're consistent with the relatively low operating rates that we've seen which make sense given the fall off in export demand, particularly for bleached paperboard. So there when we did the Gulf States acquisition we said we think we're the right owner for this mill because we have a huge near natural short position in bleached board mill, and we'll just are just going to unfold.", "So on bleached board which is, as you know, pretty significant for us that it's really not an issue and the issue is much more how do the industry participants protect pricing. And their absent hacks (ph) subsidy, I don't think people are making a lot of money on just the cash flow basis but at tax flow I mean the taxes and beyond that but recycled ... so you'd asked also about recycled, what was your question about recycle?", "Joshua Zaret - Longbow Research", "Well, same in that case...", "James A. Rubright", "Oh, yes, just backlogs; well actually backlogs are okay in our current recycled paperboards sector. No they're not. Demands are not robust but the backlogs are higher than the date they were in October and November.", "Joshua Zaret - Longbow Research", "Okay, then I guess, the follow up question that is when do you first begin to see the seasonality factor? Was it a late spring thing for your bleached board and recycled or would you be seeing it now, if there is?", "James A. Rubright", "No, you would see it now. The -- starts this part of the year are the mid summer, there are any number of plant outages in the month of July so marketplace will tend to slow down a little bit in the middle till the late summer and then the next time it slows down is November to December. So this quarter should feel good.", "Joshua Zaret - Longbow Research", "Okay, okay. And then finally and this is just an annual question before you talked about the alternative fuel credit and pretty long a revenue line, is that going to be taxable?", "James A. Rubright", "There is -- it really depends upon how you receive the credit as to whether or not it is taxable in our case, we think it will generally not be taxable although there maybe some inefficiency with respect to some portion of the credit.", "Joshua Zaret - Longbow Research", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", ": Chip Dillon of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Chip Dillon - Credit Suisse", "Yes. Good morning.", "James A. Rubright", "Good morning.", "Chip Dillon - Credit Suisse", "You had a obviously a terrific quarter in consumer packaging. And you did mentioned that you saw some of the prices or you've seen them having down a little bit. And I m looking at the published numbers I guess if you look at clear recorded news as close proxy we've only seen that. I think about 20 or may be $30 in erosion.", "James A. Rubright", "Right.", "Chip Dillon - Credit Suisse", "So you might correct me on that.", "James A. Rubright", "No.", "Chip Dillon - Credit Suisse", "And so far and so I was sort of wondering it would seem to me that some of these, this elevated margin should persist?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, the fact is that the operating rates or coated recycle board have stayed pretty high in the 90s. So I think that explains a lot of the -- what happened from a pricing standpoint. And as I mentioned earlier in the call although the index prices are coming down. This was a year in which we renewed a number of legacy contracts that we entered into in an environment in which pricing was lower.", "So that is when you get to the -- ultimately the Rock-Tenn realized by seeing the more meliorated effect of the market drops themselves.", "So that business should continue to be healthy.", "Chip Dillon - Credit Suisse", "Got you. And is there some and I would assume that some of the structural changes we've seen in recent years are contributing to what I would say is a new paradigm for margins versus what we saw in the past?", "Steven Voorhees", "That could easily be the case.", "Chip Dillon - Credit Suisse", "And then could you talk a little bit about uncoated recycle board and any competition you're seeing there. And I know it can't be done on a dine but any of your customers looking at sort of lowering some of the quality that they are using because it seems like they're quite a spread at least when you look at the profitability between uncoated and coated?", "Steven Voorhees", "We definitely are not. Seeing people look for lower prices and lower quality, in fact the marketplace is probably going the other direction. As you know for several of the competitors in the uncoated market and it's highly consolidated as you know people are concerned about the financial conditions and several of the participants in that market, and we see ourselves face with really pretty attractive opportunities for our two market uncoated paperboard mills.", "Chip Dillon - Credit Suisse", "Got you. Okay. And then last question, when you look at the 30% EBITDA margins at Solvay was that a surprise to you, in other words are the recycled mills out there -- they have so much less operating leverage than you have say with the craft mill like you have done and the bleached board facility?", "James A. Rubright", "I'm not sure I understand this.", "Chip Dillon - Credit Suisse", "I mean the fact is...", "James A. Rubright", "What I surprised is if you told me that we were going to see a reduction in recycled fiber pricing of the order of magnitude that we saw, my belief would have been well I need to know what's going to happen to three and other input cost for virgin because 60% of the market virgin and 40% recycled. We will benefit substantially from a reduction in recycled fiber pricing and that's pretty much what's happened.", "Chip Dillon - Credit Suisse", "Yeah, I'm sorry Jim, what I meant to say is but you ran at well below normal operating rates at Solvay. And so I guess to ask differently if you had the recycle the OCC costs that you had in this last quarter with the pricing.", "James A. Rubright", "Yeah.", "Chip Dillon - Credit Suisse", "How much margin loss do you think you saw because you were running slower?", "James A. Rubright", "Yeah, I prefer not to quantify although we've done a lot analysis it's not perfect. But I do understand your question and the regarding the leverage is that you probably are significantly better able to take advantage of reduction in volume in recycle mill like hours running and Solvay does then we would have been in a comparable version now.", "Chip Dillon - Credit Suisse", "Okay, got you. And then last question you were talking earlier about this 65%, 35% sort of pass through dynamic with containerboard and boxes. When we look at some of your competitors, some of them are saying in the last quarter you only saw maybe a fourth let's say of the cumulative $60 ton drop, and maybe a fourth to a third so far. And would that be roughly consistent with your experience in other words could we see a 20 or $30 average price decline in your realizations in the corrugated segment in the third fiscal quarter versus the second?", "James A. Rubright", "You're definitely going to see some. But we because of our, what we're doing in these essentially we've cut out spot times pretty much of the entire quarters, so everything was selling under contract. And our contracts take the index into account the next month.", "So for the increase I mean -- for any decrease that occurred were an effective date prior to April, 1 you saw it.", "Chip Dillon - Credit Suisse", "Got you.", "James A. Rubright", "So much back that up.", "Chip Dillon - Credit Suisse", "So for example the April, pulp and paper weak price would be reflected in March shipments?", "James A. Rubright", "April would be reflected in May shipments.", "Chip Dillon - Credit Suisse", "I mean May shipments. Got you. Okay. All right great, thanks very much.", "James A. Rubright", "Yeah.", "Operator", "At this time, we saw no further questions.", "James A. Rubright", "We thank you all for joining our call. We appreciate it.

Welcome to the MWV first quarter results conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, and later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. (Operator instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Jason Thompson. Please go ahead.", "Jason Thompson", "Thanks, Ann. And good morning, everyone. This morning we announced our results before the market opened. The notification of this morning\u2019s call was broadly disclosed. Further, this morning\u2019s call is being webcast at mwv.com and slides that accompany this call are available there as well. I\u2019ll briefly remind you that certain statements we make may be forward-looking and are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties described in our public filings. Furthermore, contents contain time sensitive information that, although correct today, may change with the passage of time.", "First, a brief recap of the results we reported this morning. For the first quarter, we reported a net loss from continuing operations of $79 million or $0.46 per share. This included after-tax restructuring charges of $51 million or $0.30 per share related to facility closures, asset write-downs, and employee separation costs.", "Now here to tell you more about our results for the first quarter are John Luke, Chairman and CEO; Jim Buzzard, our President; and Mark Rajkowski, CFO. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to John.", "John Luke", "Jason, thanks very much, and good morning. From the first signs of the financial crisis that has led to the present severe global recession, we have been taking decisive steps to strengthen MWV\u2019s financial position and performance. We have reduced overhead and manufacturing costs, improved operating productivity, shuttered facilities, sold or exited commoditized businesses, and aggressively managed our cash and liquidity. We\u2019ve reported and discussed many of these in January and our work continues today.", "We are on track to deliver the savings we announced earlier this year as part of our strategic cost management initiative, including the $125 million of overhead reductions and facility closures we accelerated when the economic decline worsened. We are ahead of our plans for the first quarter and we expect to deliver this full amount by the end of 2009 and over $250 million by 2010.", "We are also executing our plans and strategies to ensure that MWV is creating and maximizing value for our shareholders, even in a challenging environment like we experienced in the first quarter. We are holding firm on pricing, capitalizing on our innovative solutions, and maintaining our disciplined focus on the most profitable opportunities in our markets. We will discuss all of this in our report to you today.", "As a direct result of our focused strategy and disciplined execution, MWV\u2019s overall performance in the first quarter, arguably one of the toughest our industry has faced in great many years, was relatively stable in the face of significantly weaker demand in most all of our markets. While our businesses were impacted by these market pressures, we made clear execution-driven improvement in each.", "As examples, in our Consumer Solutions business, we combated volume declines with actions that reduced cost and increased earnings compared to the prior year. And in our Community Development and Land Management business, we increased earnings and cash flow through our disciplined approach to extracting maximum value from our land assets.", "Across our businesses, we remain fully focused on making improvements to our overall competitive position and value creation profile, including a rigorous economic review of our markets, products, facilities, and customers. We have also maintained a priority focus on value enhancing innovation and growth.", "For example, in packaging we are reaping the benefits of our focused investments with a newly designed paperboard for the tobacco and other markets, as well as our Shellpak solution for the healthcare market. And we remain a valued partner to our customers in this difficult economic period because of our financial strength and reliability, as well as our leadership position and innovation expertise in key packaging and other markets. This has earned MWV increased share in the markets that we have targeted for a long-term profitable growth.", "This is an unusually difficult economic environment, as today\u2019s GDP report for Q1 reinforces. And we certainly can\u2019t control demand, but we can commit to doing the right things to deliver value for our shareholders, choosing the right markets, participating with the right strategies, focusing on the right growth opportunities, and getting our cost structure right, both today and for the longer term. We are doing all of this and more to make MWV a global leader in packaging and a sound investment in any economy.", "I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Jim Buzzard to discuss our operational highlights for the first quarter. Jim?", "Jim Buzzard", "Thank you, John. Clearly, the operating environment, especially demand from our customers was challenging during the first quarter. Not one of our businesses escaped the negative impact of reduced consumer spending and lower economic activity. Our focus was to continue implementing our strategies to preserve our financial strength and execute on operational improvements. And we did well in these areas. This focus helped us to stabilize our performance in this difficult economy to extend our strong relationship with customers and importantly, we will improve our earnings when demand recovers.", "We delivered price improvement in a tough environment, generated operational productivity through projects at all of our facilities around the globe, reduced our overhead costs, closed facilities, exited unprofitable business, and aggressively masked production to demand to effectively manage our cash resources. Each of these actions will position us well as demand improves.", "However, in spite of these proactive steps, we could not overcome the impact of significantly lower volumes across our businesses. While the cumulative impact of volume declines was 11% for the whole company, we did benefit somewhat in the balance of our markets, product lines, and geographic footprint. We had relatively stable performances in more resilient consumer markets such as beverage, healthcare, tobacco, and home and garden. But several of our markets were hit especially hard by customers drawing down inventories and by the decrease in consumer spending, including more discretionary markets for media and luxury personal care packaging.", "I\u2019ll talk about the impact of these volume declines on each of our businesses during the quarter. I\u2019m also going to update our view of the current dynamics in each of our targeted markets. And as always, you will find additional information for each of our business segments in the slide presentation that accompanies this call.", "In the Packaging Resources segment, sales and earnings declined significantly compared to the prior year because of weaker demand for all of our paperboard grades. Some customers are reporting a 20% drop in business, especially commercial printers and general packaging customers. As a result, shipments of both bleached board and coated natural kraft were down in the quarter, 18% and 12% respectively.", "We are seeing some signs of a bottom in the marketplace, as April orders suggest a more moderate year-over-year rate of decline. It is unclear at this point if the improvement is a result of the sustainable increase in demand or the impact of seasonality or the end of destocking in the supply chain. During the quarter, we took aggressive actions to manage our production levels to meet demand, including market related downtime at all three of our major North American mills.", "The production team took every measure possible to reduce costs and accelerate productivity improvements. And our commercial team continued to do a great job holding firm on prices. However, the unused capacity to mills contributed to under-absorption of fixed costs and a steep decline in earnings.", "Rigesa operated well during the quarter even as they struggled with many of the same volume challenges due to their customers experiencing weaker export markets to Europe and the United States. Earnings were lower in this business for the first quarter largely because of lower sales and the exchange effect of the continued decline in the Brazilian real.", "In the Consumer Solutions segment, earnings increased compared to the prior year, even through a period of tremendous difficulty in many of our consumer packaging markets. Sales were down year-over-year consistent with the overall impact of the economy and lower consumer spending. But our diligent effort on cost reductions and productivity improvements along with the impact of our ongoing facility actions contributed to the better performance in this segment during the first quarter.", "Let me go through each of our consumer packaging markets to give you a sense of the commercial drivers in the quarter. The large and diverse global beverage market was a reasonably steady performer during the first quarter, especially the more recession-resilient segments such as take-home formats for beer and private label brands.", "In North America, our beer volumes were up as consumers chose domestic cans over premium models, a trend that placed our strength in multi-packs. Soft drink volumes were lower overall as our customers continued to exchange volume for price. We expect them to rebuild volumes with summer promotions and we are prepared to take advantage of our volume increases in take-home packaging.", "In Europe, our beverage business is more focused on premium beer brands. So we saw and continue to see some volume declines there due to the economy. We do gain with new business opportunities in both China and India where we made our first multi-pack sale with Coke who just reported more than 30% unit case volume growth in that large and developing consumer marketplace.", "Declines in the market for media packaging are no surprise. We\u2019ve seen 10% to 15% overall deterioration. We have taken out capacity and reduced cost in order to keep our performance in line with the overall market and maximized cash generation from this business. And we are continuing to focus on growing the segments such as video games and Blu-ray DVD.", "The overall global healthcare market growth has moderated with some continued strength in generic prescription drugs and private label OTC. A consumer trend toward these alternatives has benefited healthcare-specific retailers as well as discount prescription programs such as those at Wal-Mart and other mass retailers. We performed well and gained share in this market by continuing to build our leadership positions in adherence packaging for prescription drugs.", "Demand for our Shellpak adherence solution is growing steadily. And we are further expanding Shellpak with new retail customers and through agreements with pharmaceutical companies in Asia and North America. Another key element of our healthcare business is our advantage position in pharmaceutical pumps. We had growth in Europe with preservative free pump technology during the first quarter. And we are working to extend that business in North America soon.", "The personal care market remained difficult in the first quarter, as it is closely tied to discretionary consumer spending. Our customers continued to destock their supply chain and postpone new product launches. The impact has been especially acute in luxury applications such as fragrance where volumes were down by as much as 25% to 30%, with somewhat less impact on the more stable mass market for lotions, creams, and leg gels. Our performance has been in line with these trends in the broader market.", "As we said last quarter, we know that the personal care market will turn around. Our recent actions to exit on profitable business, close underperforming facilities, and improve our business model in personal care will ensure that we emerge as a more focused and more profitable player in the personal care market.", "In the home and garden market, there has been an overall slowdown, especially in North America, and a trend toward private label products in more standard solutions. Our business is holding steady, heading into the seasonally strong spring and summer periods for this market in the United States. Our performance in this market has been strengthened by the addition of customers and selected assets from Continental AFA. And although some garden products are shipping later in the spring than usual, our customers expect an uptick in demand as more consumers stayed during this summer and focus on home activities over other options.", "We are continuing to improve the business model and operations of the Consumer Solutions segment to focus on the most profitable opportunities in the most attractive markets. We saw the positive impact this quarter and we are continuing with our work to reduce overhead costs, exit unprofitable businesses, close down capacity, and drive productivity improvements. With all of these actions, we expect to further expand our margins and deliver even better performance when customers begin to launch new products and underlying demand improves.", "Turning to our non-packaging businesses, there was a similar volume story in both the Consumer & Office Products and Specialty Chemicals segments. We continued to feel the direct impact of the broad economic decline in our Consumer & Office Products segments, as volumes were lower for calendars and time management products, as well as for envelopes used by the financial services and direct mail segments. We worked to offset this market weakness through continuing mix improvements, aggressive cost reductions, and productivity initiatives throughout the business.", "Looking ahead to the back-to-school season, we expect that selling to our retail partners will be later into the season and closure to the point of actual sell-through to the consumer. We continue to focus on our branded proprietary products where we believe we can differentiate ourselves in the marketplace. And we have good placement for these products at our largest customers. Sell-through to consumers and subsequent replenishment orders for these products will be the key to success in the back-to-school shopping season later in the third quarter.", "The Specialty Chemicals segment posted sales and earnings decreases due again to the impact from weak markets. Demand for pine chemicals, ink resins, and automotive carbons were well below last year\u2019s levels, resulting in significant adjustments to our refining and production schedules to reduce inventory.", "Though we were able to remain firm on pricing, manage our production costs, and reduce overhead spending during the quarter, the volume decreases and under-utilization resulted in lower segment profit compared to the prior year. Late in the quarter we began to see some improvement in order flows. For example, asphalt markets improved due to the seasonal uptick and in part due to stimulus spending by governments, especially in China.", "The Community Development and Land Management segment generated strong earnings and cash flow during the first quarter. We continued to build this business by focusing on a disciplined approach to extracting the maximum value from our land holdings. As evidence, we closed 18 transactions during the quarter, conveying about 34,000 acres for an average price per acre of about $2,000.", "This includes continued progress in our rural small-tract program as well as a 25,000-acre tract if forestland in South Carolina that returned gross proceeds of more than $49 million. A strong valuation for this large sale was realized because our forestland was well managed as high quality infrastructure and excellent timber growing conditions. This business continues to actively market about 75,000 acres and has shown continued strength in very small tracts of less than 250 acres.", "Just as important, we are making progress with our entitlement and planning activities on a number of real estate projects, including East Edisto in South Carolina. We are in the final stages with the master plan for East Edisto, and we will be ready to share that with the public in the coming months.", "Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss some of our financial metrics for the first quarter. Mark?", "Mark Rajkowski", "Thanks, Jim. During the first quarter, we executed on our plans to further strengthen our cash flow from operations and maintain our excellent liquidity position through our seasonally weakest period. Our financial strength is increasingly becoming a key competitive advantage in what remains a very uncertain economic environment.", "While weaker demand impacted revenue and earnings across our businesses, we performed well in a number of areas that are critical to our strategy, including operational productivity, cash management, overhead cost reductions, and price recovery. Good results in these areas helped to offset lower volumes and stabilize our performance along with strong earnings and cash flow from our land management business.", "As a result of our efforts, we are ahead of our expectations for free cash flow through the first quarter. We are on track to achieve our goal of positive free cash flow for the year. Cash flow from operations in the first quarter was about $90 million, largely driven by working capital improvements and increased cash flow from our land management business. Compared to the first quarter of 2008, we improved our cash-to-cash cycle by almost five days by driving collections of receivables and reducing inventory levels to match significantly lower demand.", "Our working capital and cash management discipline is helping us to maintain our financial strength during this difficult period. At the end of the first quarter, cash and short-term investments were more than $500 million, and our pension plan remained 130% over-funded. While not included in our first quarter results, we recently received payments of $77 million for an alternative fuel excise tax credit that will further improve our liquidity and financial strength. This amount represents approximately 11 weeks of participation at all three of our US paperboard mills during the first quarter. We are continuing to apply for additional credits while this program is in place.", "During the quarter, we brought inventories down compared to our normal seasonal pattern by aggressively managing production to meet lower demand and by pushing material purchases and production as close to shipping dates as possible. As expected, these actions negatively impacted our gross margins due to substantial, under-absorbed, fixed manufacturing costs, which mask significant operational productivity gains we achieved through projects at the mills and the rationalization of our manufacturing facilities.", "Our adjusted gross margin, which excludes restructuring, was 16.7%, almost 200 basis points higher than last year. Gross margin increased over 100 basis points from productivity improvements, over 200 basis points from improved pricing, and about 300 basis points from a higher mix of land sales year-over-year. Partially offsetting these improvements was the impact of under-absorbed fixed manufacturing costs due to market downtime of over 300 basis points and 100 basis points due to foreign exchange.", "We have also taken significant actions to improve our business model by eliminating unprofitable products, reducing overhead costs, and restructuring our manufacturing footprint. We are executing on a very clear plan that will not only shore up cash flow and earnings in today\u2019s difficult recessionary environment, but importantly, will provide us with a business model that will generate significant operating leverage when the economy recovers.", "Earlier this year, we announced plans to eliminate $100 million of corporate and business overhead costs and close or restructure as many as 14 facilities for another $25 million in savings this year. These actions are moving forward with excellent pace and have already resulted in $14 million of savings in the first quarter. Through the first quarter, we have announced the closure or restructuring of eight facilities and reduced more than 800 positions, which is ahead of plan.", "As the program continues to accelerate through the rest of this year, we are on track to deliver our target of 2,000 positions in at least $125 million of savings in 2009. We recorded $81 million of pretax restructuring costs related to this program in the first quarter, of which $58 million were non-cash charges. Adjusting to exclude these restructuring costs, SG&A decreased on an absolute basis from $203 million last year to $192 million during the first quarter. We expect this improvement trend to accelerate as we realize increasing benefits from our cost reduction actions through the balance of this year.", "With these actions and many more, we have solidified our financial position and stabilized our performance in this very uncertain environment. Still, market visibility remains extremely poor. And despite some recent improvement in order rates in several of our businesses, there were still a high degree of uncertainty in forward-looking demand.", "We do expect to see a normal seasonal increase in volumes across our business in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. However, year-over-year volumes are expected to be lower due to continued weakness in the global economy. We are going to remain vigilant with our plans to preserve our strong cash position, and in that regard, will continue to respond to weak demand by taking downtime at many of our mills, facilities, and refineries.", "In our mill business, we expect total market-related downtime to be comparable to the first quarter, which will result in under-absorbed fixed overhead cost. On the positive side, we expect to realize greater benefits from the actions we have taken to reduce overhead costs and capacity rationalization, as well as continued benefits from deflation in energy, raw materials, and freight costs.", "In summary, we are continuing to aggressively our controllables, including price recovery, overhead cost reductions, manufacturing productivity, and working capital to drive cash flow and liquidity and to improve our competitive position in each of the markets that we serve.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to John.", "John Luke", "Thanks, Mark. Before concluding and getting to your questions, I\u2019d like to summarize by saying that MWV continues to benefit from a strategic path we\u2019ve been following for several years. While the first quarter was clearly tough, our performance was bolstered by our strong financial position, our continued focus on attractive packaging in other markets, our firm grip on the controllable elements of our business plan, and our determination to create long-term value for shareholders. It is this focus that makes MWV a sound investment in an uncertain economy and will substantially improve our results when consumer spending rebound and the broader global economy recovers.", "We will now be happy to answer whatever questions you have this morning.", "Jason Thompson", "Ann, can you please queue up the question-and-answer session?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Yes. (Operator instructions) The first one is from Claudia Hueston. She is with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Claudia Hueston \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Thank you very much. Good morning.", "John Luke", "Good morning, Claudia.", "Claudia Hueston \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "I was hoping you could just elaborate a little bit on the pickup you\u2019ve seen in March and April across your businesses, and then particularly across your geographies if you are seeing anything different in your non-US businesses or the export market.", "John Luke", "Yes. Claudia, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim and Mark to comment a bit more definitively on this. I think that it\u2019s fair to say that whether it is, as Jim commented at the outset, a little bit of pickup that reflects a reversal of some of the destocking, whether it reflects an early pickup and demand, we are certainly seeing this in the North American markets. But it is way too early to predict that this is anything other than a few data points in our markets. I think as we move through the quarter, we and others across this industry and the broad range of industries participating in this economy will be able to discern whether there is substance to it. But Jim, you might want to just put a little bit more color on some of the specifics behind the comment.", "Jim Buzzard", "Sure. Thanks, John. Clearly, we begin to see an uptick from a seasonal standpoint in the second quarter. Our beverage business begins to improve, which impacts both our converting operations and our mill-based businesses. And as John said, I think we clearly are seeing the impact of some lower destocking. We also were impacted in the first quarter by some pre-buying as we moved pricing in a couple of markets as well. So we did see some effects slip into Q4 of last year. In terms of geographies, I think it\u2019s fairly balanced. We are seeing our emerging markets performing better, certainly than Europe and North America, which still remain fairly weak. As John said, this is really a three or four-week phenomenon that we are looking at and still much too early for us to make a call on where this is heading.", "Claudia Hueston \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay. That\u2019s great, helpful. Thank you. And then I just wanted to confirm, I think you had said positive free cash flow for the year. You defined free cash flow is after dividends. Am I right on that front?", "Mark Rajkowski", "That\u2019s right, Claudia. Yes, positive free cash flow covers CapEx and dividends.", "Claudia Hueston \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay. And could you just provide a little bit of guidance on CapEx for the year and then maybe just comment on your priorities for cash, particularly in light of sort of the extra cash you\u2019re getting from the fuel credits?", "Mark Rajkowski", "CapEx plan for 2009 is $250 million. And in terms of plans for cash, we have been and will continue to remain balanced in terms of looking at returning value to our shareholders and covering our debt service obligations. But as far as use of funds relative to the alternative fuels, mix credit, right now we just got the cash and we\u2019re going to keep that in the back for now.", "John Luke", "Yes. I would just reinforce what Mark is saying, Claudia, by reiterating the fact that liquidity has been a priority as we have moved into this year. The alternative fuels credit is an addition to the liquidity we\u2019ve been able to maintain and nurture. And until we see a decided definite turn in the economic activity, liquidity will remain a number one priority.", "Claudia Hueston \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Great, thanks very much. And then just finally, do you have any guidance on the tax rate for the year?", "Mark Rajkowski", "Claudia, we are still looking at a rate that\u2019s in the low-20s. Yes. So, we had a little higher rate this first quarter due to a couple of discrete items related to audit settlements. Okay?", "Claudia Hueston \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Yes, thanks.", "John Luke", "Thanks, Claudia.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of George Staphos. Please go ahead, your line is open. George, your line is open, go ahead.", "George Staphos \u2013 Banc of America", "Hi. Thanks, everyone. Good morning. I wanted to get into as much as possible the outlook for the quarter and for the year. Could you provide us any kind of guidance at this juncture for what land sales could look like over the course of the year? And the related question would be, realizing that there is a fair amount of downtime this quarter, do you think you could be breakeven or better, excluding for a minute any kind of impact from land sales in Q2?", "Mark Rajkowski", "Hey, George.", "George Staphos \u2013 Banc of America", "Hi, Mark.", "Mark Rajkowski", "Yes. We are \u2013 you know, it\u2019s difficult to tell. I think \u2013", "George Staphos \u2013 Banc of America", "I understand.", "Mark Rajkowski", "You know, we don\u2019t necessarily expect the same level of cash flow and earnings from our land management business in the second quarter. But as you know, those revenues and earnings are \u2013 they are relatively lumpy that the important thing there is we have our team focused on executing the strategy, which is to build a strong business for the future. And as far as the rest of the business, Packaging, Consumer & Office Products, and Specialty Chemicals, as Jim mentioned, while we have seen some uptick in volume, certainly it\u2019s not clear as to whether or not that\u2019s a clear and improving trend in underlying demand. We think it\u2019s going to continue to be relatively bumpy in the second quarter and probably through the second half of the year. So I\u2019m not going to provide a forecast that at this point is just too uncertain.", "George Staphos \u2013 Banc of America", "I understand. But we figured we would try anyway. If we look at the backlogs right now, there are two weeks. Are you please with where those are relative to what might be a pickup in demand? And how low did they get over the course of the first quarter?", "John Luke", "Jim can give you some more definitive information here, George. But I think \u2013 you know, a couple of weeks backlog particularly against the backdrop of today\u2019s economy is very comfortable and not at all that normal. So that is welcome from that standpoint. And Jim?", "Jim Buzzard", "George, I\u2019ll just add that we sort of maintain them at about the two-week level. We obviously look ahead and will either slow back or take downtime to protect that. I think as we entered the second quarter \u2013 historically we\u2019d hope to see something approaching 2.5 to three weeks. And we would just have to continue to watch and monitor that situation. But as I said earlier, we clearly will manage our supply to what the demand is and continue to do that throughout the quarter and the rest of the year.", "George Staphos \u2013 Banc of America", "Okay. Two last questions. First of all, in terms of corporate expense, I realize you are pleased with your progress and I think you said you are on time or ahead of plan. And certainly we are impressed with the cash generation over the course of the quarter. Having said that, when I look at the last page in the handout, I see the adjusted corp [ph] and other remaining basically flat with each of the last couple of first quarters. Can you \u2013 if you will parse what the underlying progress is such that you are actually making an improvement in corporate win that\u2019s not really visible at the surface level.", "John Luke", "Sure, George. Let me handle this one. In terms of year-over-year comparison with the 2008 first quarter, we are down in terms of expense roughly 10% for salaries, benefits and related costs. And what\u2019s masking that is the fact that there has actually been a decrease of charges pushed down to the businesses because spending has been down. So the businesses are benefiting from those lower costs. And at the corporate level, it appears flat, but the actual underline spend is down about 10%.", "George Staphos \u2013 Banc of America", "So those costs will be about $5 million, $6 million? Am I thinking about it the right way?", "John Luke", "That\u2019s exactly right, yes.", "George Staphos \u2013 Banc of America", "The last one and I\u2019ll turn it over. I realize we are still early days to some degree in terms of the transformation of the packaging business in total. But when we look back, say, two or three years from now, what should we see the key products, substrates, end markets, what are they going to be from MeadWestvaco in packaging? And what do you think your more diversified model will succeed when traditionally anyway diversified in packaging doesn\u2019t work as well? Thanks, guys. Good luck on the quarter.", "John Luke", "George, that\u2019s a wide open question. Let us just comment that the first order of business is to continue and complete the transformation and look for rosier days in the economy as we move forward from a substrate standpoint, clearly from paperboard, high-quality bleached board with an ever keen focus on participation in the higher end markets, as we have been focused. And clearly we continue to see a good opportunity for a high quality coated natural kraft paperboard. Our downstream businesses will both use those products as well as they do presently arrange plastic materials. And so we see continued focus on serving those \u2013 our markets with those range of products. And as we\u2019ve reinforced, healthcare, eye and personal care, tobacco, food are among the high quality growing end markets that we see an opportunity to serve, including obviously beverage.", "Operator", "And from UBS, we have a question from Gail Glazerman. Please go ahead. You line is open.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "Hi, thank you. I was hoping you can talk a little bit about input cost relief [ph]. Clearly it varied by segment, but overall your costs were up. What should we expect kind of looking through the year in terms of the timing of the relief?", "Jim Buzzard", "Yes, let me take this one. We have seen significant improvement quarter sequentially. We are still getting pressure on certain raw materials. But overall, we are seeing an improving trend and we would expect that trend to continue throughout the course of this year in terms of relative improvement as we compare ourselves to what were very, very high cost quarters in the third and the fourth quarter.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "And what specific inputs that will be causing pressure at this point?", "Jim Buzzard", "Well, there are a number of chemicals that we use, particularly in our mill-based businesses like caustic and sodium chlorate that while trending downward are still higher than what they were in the first quarter of last year, as they had big run-ups in the second half of the year.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "Okay. And caustic, I mean, (inaudible) contracts, is that an issue that you have contracts that maybe you didn\u2019t feel the full weight of last year, or is it just a matter of timing of flowing through? Because I thought that is kind of back to year-ago levels at this point.", "Jim Buzzard", "Gail, part of it is just flowing through the system. And it was clearly a very dramatic run-up throughout Q3 and Q4. Those prices have begun to moderate, but it takes time to work its way through the system.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "Okay. And kind of circling back to export markets that Claudia was asking about, will you work specifically at the mill business? Were demand trend different \u2013 the demand decline, was that different between what you are seeing domestically versus exports? And what trends are you seeing today?", "Jim Buzzard", "I think there are a number of factors that impact our export business. Clearly currency is one that impacts us. We did make some decisions in certain regions of Asia where much greater competition from local producers who drove prices to levels we do not elect to participate in was another factor. But as I said earlier, on balance in our emerging markets, we are still seeing relatively good demand. So it\u2019s as much a currency and a market selection issue as anything else at this point.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "Okay. And just last question. When you look at downtime being similar in the second quarter as the first quarter, would you expect the absorption cost to decline at all? Are you getting any more efficient at taking down time?", "Jim Buzzard", "I would expect the absorption costs to stay about the same. You get better at these things unfortunately the more do you them. But in terms of the amount of time, that\u2019s what dictates the absorption.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Thank you.", "John Luke", "Thanks, Gail.", "Operator", "And Mark Weintraub from Buckingham has a question. Go ahead.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham", "Thank you. On the inflation question, and you pointed out you still had a negative variance in the first quarter, would you expect that to be positive in the second quarter? And can you give us a sense as to what impact hedging might be having on the rate with which that\u2019s flowing through? Or perhaps if you didn\u2019t have hedges in place, what type of difference would have that made in the first quarter relative to what you actually reported?", "Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, Mark. We \u2013 first question related to the trend in terms of inflation, we do expect that to improve in the second quarter. We would expect to see year-over-year benefit in terms of input costs in the second quarter. The impact relative to our hedging of nat gas, certainly when you\u2019re hedging, when pricing are going up, you are in the money. And when they are going down, you\u2019re out of the money. And certainly we are \u2013 as prices have come down, we are out of the money. We are about a little over 60% hedged for the second quarter, and that declines over the balance of the year. But that is a function of a consistent hedging policy.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham", "And what were you hedged in the first quarter? Was that also 60%?", "Mark Rajkowski", "Those percentages are relatively consistent, between 60%, 70%.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham", "And can you share with us what you are hedged at?", "Mark Rajkowski", "The all-in price was above market.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham", "Okay. I guess I\u2019m just trying to get to \u2013 if you didn\u2019t have the hedges in place, how much would you have benefited in the first quarter? Just trying to get a sense as to, as the hedges roll of, how big a benefit we are going to see.", "Mark Rajkowski", "In the overall scheme of things, Mark, it\u2019s really not that material.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham", "Okay. I guess I\u2019m \u2013 well, it\u2019s nice to see things moving in the right direction. Relative to some of the commentary and performance at other companies, the cost inflation just doesn\u2019t seem to be \u2013 now deflation, doesn\u2019t seem to be benefiting you as much yet as in some other situation. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve been \u2013 if you\u2019ve got any color you can provide to help understand that perhaps.", "Jim Buzzard", "Mark, this is Jim. I think in some cases, what you\u2019re seeing earlier are dramatic drops in things like OCC, clearly the pulp markets turned more rapidly. And so I think certain input costs where we don\u2019t participate have declined at a much more rapid and a sooner rate than what we are beginning to see. But as Mark said, we will work hard at this. We will begin to see it flow through, and we would expect the improvements in Q2.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham", "Okay, great. And then lastly, I appreciate the slide where you showed your land in the Charleston area and what you had sold. I assume that you provided that to demonstrate that the lands which you sold were further out and presumably less valuable than the lands that you continue to own. Is that a correct interpretation of that slide?", "John Luke", "I think that\u2019s a fair assumption of the overall situation and certainly the slide with it, Mark. As we have talked before, I think as we moved through this period, we wanted to be in a position where there is value attached to fewer forestland to be able to selectively extract value. This was attractive land that was sold and it was up closer to Georgetown. As we look a little bit closer into the Charleston area, it\u2019s depicted on the map we\u2019ve got land that is of higher value, a good deal of which has much more development value attached to it. And that\u2019s clearly the focus. And as Mark indicated earlier, a tremendous amount of very, very good work underway in our CD & LM group at this stage of the game, both dealing with the entitlement in and around East Edisto master planning and related entitlement, as well as a series of commercial development projects in addition to looking for ongoing select forestland sales.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham", "Okay, great. And lastly, on the 75,000 acres that you are still marketing, is there enough visibility for you give us a sense as to what the duration of that program will likely be?", "John Luke", "I think that consistent with other comments that we\u2019ve offered about the marketplace today, it is difficult to be predictive here, Mark.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham", "Okay, thank you.", "John Luke", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And next we have Chip Dillon. He is from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Yes, thank you very much. Good morning.", "John Luke", "Hi, Chip.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Couple of questions. First, there were some pretty heavy fires I guess in the Georgetown area last weekend. Did any of that in South Carolina affect your land?", "John Luke", "Those fires were heavy, as you said. Those were to the best of our knowledge to the north of the Myrtle Beach area. And our land holdings would be to the South and obviously to the west from there.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, that\u2019s good. And then, Mark, you mentioned the five-day reduction in the cash cycle, which is quite impressive. And yet on the other hand, we are hearing about a lot of pressure from folks like AmBev and others who are trying to get longer terms. How is that looking prospectively? And is part of this improvement you are stretching at your payments or is it more you are getting people to pay you faster?", "Mark Rajkowski", "Well, it\u2019s a combination of all the above. We saw very good improvement in the collection of receivables. We made very good progress in reducing past dues. We also continued to make progress in our days payable outstanding. And we would expect to look to drive continued improvements there. And as Jim mentioned, relative to how we are managing our capacity in downtime, we\u2019re going to look to drive further improvement on the inventory side as well.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then you mentioned in the emerging markets you were generally happy with how things are going. But you also mentioned there were some competitive situations I think in China. Did that specifically affect the Wuxi facility and how it was able to attract profitable business in the quarter?", "John Luke", "Yes, I\u2019ll turn to Jim here in a second, Chip. I think characterization of emerging markets is that the efforts that the teams have under way are continuing to pay benefits, both in terms of near-term realization of business as well as in laying the groundwork for solid, meaningful, long-term growth in the years to come. I think the experience in the near-term, which continued to yield positive benefit, was in part offset by some of the erosion of paperboard business, erosion that is to local price alternative that, as Jim noted, we just chose not to participate in. So, Jim?", "Jim Buzzard", "No, that\u2019s right. And in terms of Wuxi, I think the only color I would add would be we actually had record throughput in our primary plastics facility in Wuxi in the first quarter. And while we are generally happy, that is a relative term. So \u2013", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then the last question is, when you look at at least the published prices out there, it\u2019s amazing given, as you mentioned, the 18% drop in your shipments and other big drops, how stable the bleached board pricing has been, especially versus pulp? And have you seen this in your experience? I know you guys have been making bleached board for a long time. And are you concerned that you might start to see prices fall more than just a moderate amount in coming quarters, especially at the low end?", "John Luke", "That\u2019s a very good question. Let me just answer it by saying that we are very focused on maintaining positions that we have that generate liquidity and certainly more than adequately cover the cost inflation that we\u2019ve had in the last several months.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And Mark Connelly from Sterne Agee has a question. Your line is open, please go ahead.", "Mark Connelly \u2013 Sterne Agee", "Thank you. John, just two things. Back to the question about the balance sheet, certainly everybody in America is telling us that cash is the top priority in liquidity. But the evaluation of the MeadWestvaco portfolio isn\u2019t finished and it would seem to me that this is probably the best time you are going to get in the next decade to be looking at acquisitions to fill in where you\u2019ve got high conviction. I know that you guys say that liquidity is number one. But is evolving this portfolio further a close second?", "John Luke", "Well, I think \u2013 fair question, Mark. I think evolving the portfolio most definitely has to be a priority. But while we are working out, it\u2019s an absolute priority along with liquidity on shaping the portfolio that we have at present through the transformation that\u2019s underway. And that\u2019s going to add value and strength to our platform and strategic focus over time. Clearly there may be opportunities along the way for us to supplement that makes the businesses and market focus with some acquisitions. You are absolute right that this is a time and presumably will be a time where value is very attractive. Our liquidity is always an option. But I think right now it is with the continued serious uncertainty as to where this economy is going to go. We in no way want to compromise the strength and flexibility it affords us at present by being too opportunistic in the short run.", "Mark Connelly \u2013 Sterne Agee", "Okay. Second question then is, you\u2019ve talked in the past about school and office and the response to the international competitors and the relationships you\u2019ve built up with some of the major stores in terms of managing those aisles for them. Are those relationships strengthening, sitting the same, or getting worse with the pressure that we\u2019re feeling?", "John Luke", "Jim?", "Jim Buzzard", "Mark, I would say that those relationships are strengthening. I think that whether it\u2019s the time management and planning business, whether it\u2019s the back-to-school business, we clearly have the leading brands. We clearly continue to invest in innovation in our products. And that\u2019s good for our retail customers. And so we believe that by continuing to invest in those areas for this business, we are strengthening our position in that market.", "Mark Connelly \u2013 Sterne Agee", "Okay, very helpful. Thank you.", "John Luke", "Thank you, Mark.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Peter Ruschmeier. He is with Barclays Capital. Go ahead, Peter.", "Peter Ruschmeier \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thanks. Good morning.", "John Luke", "Hi, Pete.", "Peter Ruschmeier \u2013 Barclays Capital", "And thanks for all the details and the slides and the press release. I thought it was very helpful. A question if I could on the land development business. I\u2019m curious maybe, Mark, if you can help us with the amount of cash tax, taxes paid in the first quarter. And is it representative of the kinds of cash tax leakage that you might experience in the portfolio going forward? I\u2019m just curious on what kinds of mechanism do you have to minimize the leakage.", "Mark Rajkowski", "Well, Peter, on an overall basis, as we look across the operations, we were in a loss position. So in terms of cash taxes, it was \u2013 there really wasn\u2019t any material amount of cash tax paid in the US, which is where I think your question is focused on. What was the second part of your question?", "Peter Ruschmeier \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Well, I was really trying to think about when you monetize lands through the Land Management business, I would imagine that the basis of land sold is very, very low. But nonetheless there is some basis there. And so I\u2019m curious about what kind of cash tax rate you would expect on those sales.", "Mark Rajkowski", "I think \u2013", "Peter Ruschmeier \u2013 Barclays Capital", "In a more normal environment.", "Mark Rajkowski", "In a more normal environment, you\u2019re going to be paying closer to the statutory rate. If there are opportunities for larger tract sales as we had in the past, you can consider installment methods. But in this market, with credit environment the way it is, that becomes a little more \u2013 certainly a lot more costly and trickier to accomplish. But on a regular basis, you\u2019d expect to pay close to that statutory rate.", "Peter Ruschmeier \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And John, I was hoping you could weigh in on strategy a little bit as it relates to your timberland holdings outside the land management business, in particular on three related points I guess. I\u2019m curious \u2013 to the extent you\u2019d consider more land sales, I\u2019m curious how you have thought about that. I mean, that market has continued to hold up well in terms of timberland values. And then two other points I\u2019d be curious about, have you thought much about carbon offset agreements and what kind of opportunity there may be there? And biofuel opportunities, how do you think this plays out and what kind of an opportunity might it be for you?", "John Luke", "Pete, I think all of those things are very much on the table. We\u2019ve been very straight up in saying that we have a clear and evolving strategy for our land, whether it\u2019s development, certainly some security-based holdings near our mills, but we are always evaluating opportunities to extract value, as we have moved into the current environment while the opportunities that we would certainly expect to be there when things turn aren\u2019t as robust as they may appear on the surface. Some continue to exist, but we have also seen more serious focus on biofuels and carbon offset opportunity. And those things need to be factored in to the strategies that we have, because over time whether it is a direct value we can extract or value that can be built into the underlying acreage for someone else to extract, these things are clearly additions and more real additions to the mix than was the case a couple of years ago.", "Peter Ruschmeier \u2013 Barclays Capital", "John, just to ask maybe a little bit differently. I mean, are the remaining timber holdings viewed as strategic or have you not necessarily made that determination?", "John Luke", "No, I think there are remaining timberland holdings that some of which are strategic and others that are part of the active plan that the CDLM group is managing for divestiture in consideration \u2013 consideration for divestiture.", "Peter Ruschmeier \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. Last question if I could, I\u2019ll turn it over. Maybe a question back for Mark on the restructuring program. I guess you had $23 million of cash expenses incurred in the quarter on I guess primarily related to severance. Can you help us on the cash expense of the entire program and any guidance you can offer on the timing of that? Is it kind of a straight line, as we expect $20 million, $25 million a quarter kind of cash expenses or how does that look? And then also to the extent that you\u2019d be willing to share, the $14 million of benefits, how does that ramp as you go through the year? Is it also kind of a straight line to get you ultimately to $125 million for the year?", "Mark Rajkowski", "Sure, Pete. In terms of the portion of the restructuring charges that are non-cash, I think \u2013 or cash, I think we are going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 50%, maybe a little bit lower. I\u2019m sorry, not 50%, $50 million of program. So we would expect non-cash to continue to be in that range of two-thirds to 70%.", "Peter Ruschmeier \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful.", "Mark Rajkowski", "And there are two reasons for that. One, we have charges for asset write-offs. And two, all of the severance that we incur in the US gets paid for by our over-funded pension plan. So, most of that will be non-cash. And then in terms of the ramp, certainly we are expecting to see an acceleration of the savings in the second quarter. And that will continue to build steadily through the course of the year.", "Peter Ruschmeier \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. Thanks very much. Good luck for the quarter.", "John Luke", "Thanks, Pete.", "Mark Rajkowski", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And our last question comes from the line of Richard Skidmore. He is with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Richard, do you want to dial back in? We seem to have lost him. Richard, if you\u2019d like to queue up one more time, that would be star one. Let\u2019s wait a moment for his queue. We do have an additional question here from Chip Dillon. Would you like to take that?", "Jason Thompson", "Yes, Ann, let\u2019s take that question. And I\u2019m showing we are over our hour. We\u2019ll end it there.", "Operator", "All right. Go ahead, Chip.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I\u2019ll be very quick. I know, Mark, you had mentioned that there was a 100 basis point impact from foreign exchange. And in the press release, it mentions about $20 million. So I\u2019m thinking that might be an after-tax number. And it also would imply, and this gets back to an earlier question about the inflation, that if \u2013 there was a 300 basis point hit from downtime and that might have been around $60 million pretax. Are those numbers in the ballpark?", "Mark Rajkowski", "What we are showing in the slides, Chip, are pretax numbers. And what I was \u2013 and that\u2019s the all-in impact. So there are aspects of FX that impact gross margin, SG&A, and there is also transactional FX that gets included in there, as well as we have to mark certain assets and liabilities to market. So that\u2019s all in. So the 100 basis point impact on gross margin was just the FX impact pretax related to our cost of goods sold.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Totally understand. That means that the downtime impact would be in the ballpark of $40 million then?", "Mark Rajkowski", "That\u2019s not too far off, yes.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thank you very much.", "John Luke", "Thanks, Chip.", "Jason Thompson", "All right, everyone. Well, thanks for joining us. And we look forward to your follow-up questions. Cheers.", "Operator", "That does conclude our conference for today.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session, instructions will be given at that time. (Operators Instructions). As a reminder today's conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Director of Investor Relations Mr. Jason Thompson. Please go ahead.", "Jason Thompson", "Thanks Stacy, and good morning everyone. This morning we announced our results before the market opened. The notification of this morning's call was broadly disclosed. Further, this morning's call is being webcast at mwv.com. And slides that accompany this call are available there as well.", "I'll briefly remind you that certain statements we make are forward-looking and are not guarantees of future performance, and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties described in our public fillings. Furthermore, contents contain time sensitive information that although correct today may change with the passage of time.", "First, a brief recap of the results we reported this morning. For the third quarter we reported net income of $128 million or $0.74 per share. These results include net after tax benefits from special as described in our press release of $42 million or $0.24 per share. Excluding these items net income as adjusted was $86 million or $0.50 per share. ", "Now here to tell you more about our results for the third quarter are John Luke, Chairman and CEO, Jim Buzzard our President and Mark Rajkowski CFO. I'll now turn the call over to John.", "John A. Luke, Jr.", "Jason thanks, and good morning to all of you. We are continuing to deliver solid financial performance by executing our transformation strategies to build a stronger more valuable company. During the third quarter, profitability improved in each of our business as compared to the year ago quarter, a period that\u2019s still predated dramatic decline in demand due to the financial market crisis and the ensuing recession. We are navigating through what remains a challenging economic period by focusing intently on the factors that we can directly influence to generate value for both our customers and our shareholders. This work is driving our progress and our improved results. ", "Our deliberate strategic path includes priority emphasis on making disciplined market participation choices about our products, customers and operations. As well actions to reduce overhead costs, improved operating productivity and preserve our financial strength. Our progress in these and other areas is generating returns in today\u2019s difficult economy and we will also further expand MWV\u2019s performance and competitive advantage when the economy improves. ", "In a few moments, Jim will talk about progress on the strategic cost program that we announced earlier this year, as well as the ways we are creating growth opportunities in targeted markets. Following Jim, Mark will discuss the impact of our strategic actions on the quarter\u2019s financial results and on the strength of our business model going forward.", "Before turning to them, I\u2019ll highlight a few aspects of our third quarter performance that underscore the changes we have made to strengthen the value profile of our business. First, we have made deliberate choices about market participation. Emphasizing markets and customers where we can be rewarded profitably for the differentiation and the value of our products and services and de-emphasizing or exiting product lines, facilities or business with customers where this is no longer possible.", "These steps have had an immediate beneficial impact on our results and have allowed us to focus resources on areas such as the beverage, food, personal care and healthcare markets that can be significant growth engines.", "Second, we have eliminated significant overhead costs, those associated with the businesses we\u2019ve exited, as well as other non-essential activities across our company, doing so at a rate that is ahead of our plans for 2009. We also continue to improve our operating productivity, a discipline that will deliver additional savings each and every year.", "Lastly, we are doing what is necessary to set the stage for future growth. Investing in innovation and exploring opportunities in both new and existing markets and geographies. This is a decided competitive strength that has been recognized and acknowledged by our current customers and those in markets in which we look to participate. Even during this recession we launched new products during the quarter in the healthcare, tobacco and food service markets that will be cornerstones for profitable growth.", "In summary, we are managing successfully through a difficult period. Our strategies are contributing to our current performance and will shape and strengthen our future business model. Our financial position and focus on value are enabling our role as a key partner for our customers and as a sound investment for our shareholders.", "I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Jim Buzzard who will be followed by Mark Rajkowski. Jim?", "James A. Buzzard", "Thanks John. Each of our businesses reported strong improvements and profitability by executing on the consistent set of strategic initiatives as John mentioned. Especially the combination of our market participation strategies and efforts to reduce overhead costs and improve operating productivity. Overall, profits from our business segments increased 43% compared to the third quarter last year. And our margins grew as a result of actions to reduce costs and focus on higher value products and solutions. ", "We\u2019ve continued to make progress in our strategic cost management program. As you may recall, this include steps to restructure our manufacturing footprint, improve operating productivity at our facilities, streamline our sourcing and supply chain, and reduce our SG&A and overhead costs. As promised the benefits of this program have been increasing as we move through the year and we had another quarter of strong progress. Collectively these actions delivered a $128 million to the bottom line in the third quarter.", "Our strategic cost management program is helping to counter act the effects of under absorption of fixed manufacturing cost at our facilities, and will have an even greater impact in our performance when demand in our markets improve. A word about demand, across many of our different markets, we\u2019re starting to see some stabilization albeit at the lower levels that had become the norm over the past 9 to 12 months.", "Order levels are holding steady and following seasonal patterns. We are also starting to have positive conversation with customers about new products and projects that could be entering the pipeline in 2010. While we are seeing some positive signs, we are not waiting for an economic recovery to create opportunities for growth in our business. In the attractive markets we\u2019ve targeted, we are taking share, winning new business and expanding our opportunities by focusing on the right products. ", "The innovative, cost-effective and high-value solutions our customers need to succeed in their marketplace. I will share some examples of this progress as well as our overall performance in a run down of each of our business segments. As always you\u2019ll find additional information in the slide presentation that accompanies this call. In the Packaging Resources segment sales declined compared to the prior years, but we did see signs of stabilization in the third quarter. Demand trends in this business were substantially similar to the second quarter with modest quarter-over-quarter improvement due to the normal seasonal trends.", "Shipments of SBS were down 19% in the third quarter compared to last year, a 3% increases over the second quarter. CNK volumes were down 10% compared to last year representing continued inventory management in some of our beverage customers and weakness in certain markets. We are able to increase profit and margin in this business through continued pricing discipline and operational productivity projects at our mills. Pricing for our mill-based business was up 3% over last year due to actions taken in late 2008, and we had the benefit of lower input costs especially wood and freight.", "Earnings in the Packaging Resources group were up 16% based on these gains. On an constant currency basis, earnings were up in PRG\u2019s Brazilian business, Rigesa largely through improved productivity. Rigesa continues to be the strong performer and an attractive opportunity for additional growth in Brazil. The Consumer Solutions segment continued its positive earnings trajectory increasing year-over-year profits for the third consecutive quarter. ", "Even the sales dipped more than 10%, our actions to reduce costs, increase productivity and exit unprofitable business resulted in increase in profits and margin. The overall improvement in this segment has been strong and we expected to continue as our market choices and cost and product disciplines continue to take hold. Let me go through each of the consumer packaging markets we serve in this business to give you a sense of the performance in the quarter. ", "Recent global beverage market trends continued during the seasonally strong third quarter. Beer volumes were more stable income than carbonated soft drinks as there was broad based trading down for premium brands and packaging formats to less expensive options for at-home consumption. As such our multi-pack business in North America was stable for beer markets but remained more challenging for soft drinks, where customers are still aiming for higher retail prices than the expense of volume. Beverage sales were lower in Europe where our business has more exposure to premium beer brands. But we continue to have an outstanding [real story] in Asia, where sales were up 17% during the third quarter. ", "We are expanding our business with existing customers in China, South Korea, Australia and India. And also benefiting from overall growth for the multi-pack format in the emerging markets. Overall there is only a small volume decrease in our beverage markets, which is magnified by additional impact from foreign exchange. This business increased profits compared to last year, thanks to combinations of cost reductions and improved operating productivity. ", "In Healthcare we continue to grow our business for Shellpak by gaining market shares to Wal-Mart's generic program. Since its commercial launch last year Shellpak has grown from 8 million units to 20 million units each quarter. We also just launched new product called Med-Easy, a patient-inspired convenience package for both prescription and over-the-counter drugs. We have had some initial interest in this new product and expect that to turn into volumes in 2010. The market for pharmaceutical pumps has remained relatively stable. Customers are restocking but not yet building their inventories. We are actually marketing our new preservative-free pump to European customers where regulations encourage manufacturer to take steps to eliminate preservatives that can have potential side effects for patients. In our healthcare business overall, profit doubled compared to last year. A strong performance on slightly lower sales, which reflects some lower return business we exited in North America. ", "In personal care, the market for luxury applications like fragrance is still very weak. With lower consumer spending on these discretionary items. However, we've seen some limited restocking for mass-market products and even a few signs of new luxury launches in the pipeline, which has helped to stabilize the personal care market though at very low levels. ", "While we are holding onto our share of profitable business in this market and addressing excess capacity in unattractive segments. We saw some improvements in the second quarter in Europe and Brazil and continued strength in the mass-market for soaps and antibacterials due to concerns about the H1N1 virus, these developments help to improve profitability compared to last year. ", "In Home & Garden, wet weather extended the lawn maintenance season and the H1N1 virus placed an emphasis on home cleaning and disinfection. These trends led to good sales with our biggest customers, Scosche, Clorox and SC Johnson and a significant improvement and profit growth for this business compared to last year. ", "We continue to benefit from our scale in the home and garden market. Thanks to our strong position with leading customers and last years acquisition of assets from ContinentalAFA The team has done an excellent job by strengthening our position with the key customer we picked up in that deal. ", "Lastly, we continue to successfully manage our media business for maximum cash generation. Our sales are down consistent with the overall decline in this market. We've increased earnings by sizing this business properly and by taking some position as a stable partner to the biggest studios.", "As I mentioned last quarter to launch our EcoLite DVD package has been a real hit and we remain sold out of our capacity through the end of 2009. ", "Turning to our non-package businesses both the consumer and office products and specialty chemical segments generated higher earnings compared to last year. The Consumer and Office products segment had a solid performance during the Back-to-school season in North America. ", "We secured great positioning for our branded products at the leading mass-retailers and sell-through with these products exceeded expectations as notebooks and other school supplies did better than more discretionary Back-to-school categories. Along with aggressive productivity actions and tight cost controls this solid season contributed to a 34% increase in profitability for the C&OP segment. ", "Overall sales continue to be lower in this business as envelopes and other office supplies have declined with economic conditions. Envelope volumes remain particularly weak as financial services and other customers continue to reduce their direct-mail campaigns. ", "The C&OP business recently acquired [Grupo ENCE] a high-end stationery company in Brazil's attractive and growing market. The team is working to integrate its valuable products and licensing agreements and to deliver offerings for the upcoming school season in South America. ", "The process has been smooth to date and we expect a modest favorable impact on results in this segment during the fourth quarter. Sales increased slightly in the specialty chemical segment. And the business posted a strong 50% increase in earnings this quarter driven by productivity improvement, fixed cost reductions and input cost declines. The slow but steady recovering in some of our chemicals markets has been led by sales of innovative products in global markets with more modest progress in North America. The use of our Evotherm Asphalt Additive is extending the paving season in colder climates. And overall asphalt sale grew very strong in China, Brazil and Thailand. ", "We are also capturing additional market share for Pine chemicals in oil field exploration and adhesives markets. And while the automotive carbon business remains difficult in North America and still below prior year levels, there has been a recent increase in orders as manufacturers have resumed productions after pullbacks earlier this year. We also continue to see increased demand for automotive carbon products in China.", "Real estate market conditions for the community development and land management segment were similar to the second quarter with interest and activity for smaller land tracts and industrial sites. We closed 16 small world real estate transactions with a strong average price per acre of more than $2600. We also closed our larger force land sale of 9600 acres in South Carolina during the quarter for $1900 per acre. ", "Total proceeds from land sales were nearly $23 million in the quarter. And was the primary contributor to segment earnings of $20 million. During the third quarter, we also announced the first industrial tenant at our new distribution center that is part of our joint venture with the Rockefeller Group. TBC Corporation, a producer of replacement tires will expand and locate its East Coast distribution center at this facility near the Port in Charleston, in South Carolina.", "The CDLM team continues to work with other prospects for the remaining available space at the site. As the interest in industrial properties is picking up far faster than activity in the commercial real estates sector. ", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss some of our financial metrics for the third quarter, Mark?", "Mark Rajkowski", "Thanks Jim. During the third quarter we improved almost every measure of our financial performance by successfully executing our transformation strategies across our businesses. We generated higher profits, expanded our margins and improved cash flow and what remains a difficult demand environment. ", "This progress has further strengthened our financial position, which continues to be a stabilizing force and competitive advantage. Let me highlight the actions we\u2019ve taken during the third quarter to extend the gains we made through the first half of the year and further improve our business model, which will provide us with even greater operating leverage when the economy recovers. ", "We are ahead of schedule, executing on the overhead cost reduction in capacity rationalization actions associated with the strategic cost management program we announced at the beginning of this year. This has been a very determined and comprehensive effort across our business to reduce overhead costs and eliminate unnecessary and unprofitable operating capacity. ", "As promised the benefits from this program have increased from quarter-to-quarter and through the first nine months of 2009, total savings were $90 million. Through the third quarter, we\u2019ve eliminated 1,830 positions and have completed or announced the closure or restructuring of 16 facilities, two more than we originally identified at the beginning of the year. Given the excellent progress to date, we now expect to achieve a $140 million of savings in 2009. ", "These permanent changes to our organization and manufacturing footprint have helped us significantly improve our business model and the impact is reflected in our increased operating margins. Gross margin as adjusted increased by almost 400 basis points during the third quarter to 21.6%. Our margins benefited from the cost reductions as well as strong productivity performance and input cost deflation. These improvements were more than enough to overcome the impact of under absorbed fixed manufacturing cost due to market related downtime. ", "Continuing a strong trend, third quarter SG&A of $192 million as adjusted to exclude restructuring charges and one-time items decreased by $18 million or about 9% compared to last year. Executing on our transformation strategies has had a meaningful impact on our cash flows as well as our profitability. Excluding the alternative fuel tax credits and other items, we generated $108 million of free cash flow during the quarter. As a reminder we defined free cash flow as cash after CapEx and dividends. Through September 30th of this year, we\u2019ve generated a $112 million of free cash flow, which represents a $206 million improvement compared to the first three quarters of 2008. ", "In this difficult and unpredictable economic environment, our top financial priorities remain cash generation and liquidity. And during the third quarter, we continue to strengthen our position. We ended the quarter with $765 million in cash and short-term investments, an increase of a 142 million from the end of the second quarter. We also took advantage of favorable market conditions to improve our liquidity profile by completing a 10 year, $250 million bond offering. We use the proceeds along with about $90 million of cash on hand to reduce the outstanding balance of our 2012, 6.85% notes.", "The work we\u2019ve completed through the third quarter, and the priorities we continue to manage had a very positive impact on MWV\u2019s financial performance and overall strength. We remained well positioned for what we expect to be a continued difficult environment. To that end, let me provide you with an outlook for our business in the fourth quarter.", "Despite some signs of stability, visibility remains very poor and our customers continue to be cautious about forward-looking demand. Our businesses will experience typical seasonality with lower volumes in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. And we expect similar year-over-year volume trends compared to what we saw in the third quarter of this year.", "We expect our results in the fourth quarter to benefit from additional cost savings, which will be larger than our third quarter savings. And input cost deflation, which should be at rate similar to what we experienced in the third quarter. These positive factors will be partially offset by modestly unfavorable year-over-year pricing in some markets as we compare to higher prices achieved in the fourth quarter of last year and by lower fixed manufacturing cost absorption as we continue to aggressively manage production to meet demand.", "In summary, during the fourth quarter we will continue to execute to build on momentum we\u2019ve established with our transformation strategies. This continued progress will ensure that we preserve our financial strength and further enhance our ability to compete in attractive global markets. With that I\u2019ll turn it back to John.", "John A. Luke, Jr.", "Mark thanks. In summary, we had another solid quarter in a very difficult environment. The product of our deliberate transformation strategies to make MWV strong and more competitive. Our progress had a measurable impact on our financial performance. We started this work before the recession began and it helped us weather the present storm. These efforts will continue well beyond inevitable end of the current downturn.", "Central to this work will be continuing to make choices about marketplace participation all with the goal of delivering value for our customers and our shareholders.", "That concludes our prepared remarks this morning, we\u2019ll now be happy to address any questions that you have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you ladies and gentlemen. (Operator Instructions) And the first question we go to the line of Claudia Hueston from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ", "Claudia Hueston \u2013 JPMorgan", "Thanks very much, good morning and congratulations on the quarter. ", "John A. Luke, Jr.", "Thank you.", "Claudia Hueston \u2013 JPMorgan", "I was hoping if you could provide just a little bit more detail on what drove the margin improvement in the consumer solutions business. And then Jim you are commented on how you expect the improvement to continue, what\u2019s going to drive further improvement and how should we think about the pace of that going forward. Thanks.", "John A. Luke, Jr.", "Jim you want to take that up", "James A. Buzzard", "Sure. Claudia, we really have had that we said there is disciplined cost approach and margins were driven by stolid progressional areas so our fixed costs and SG&A was down in the business we saw some benefits from our sourcing and supply chain activities. We\u2019ve made some moves to reduce capacity and closed some facilities, and we\u2019ve got a rigorous operating excellence program, which brings forward the some of the basic tenets of Lean and Six Sigma in each of these facilities. So all those are contributing to the strong performance and margin growth. Clearly, we will continue to focus in each of those areas, we will see less gain from some of them, so the capacity closures are largely behind this. We will get the benefits of those in 2010 for the full year. And the operating excellence program is a discipline that we will continue to drive and that will continue to produce results as we go forward.", "", "John A. Luke, Jr.", "Yeah and I would only emphasize just to punctuate what Jim has said because I think he has articulated it well that as our prepared remarks commented whereas in other places we\u2019ve made some very disciplined market participation choices and we have either improved the profile of business that we could in certain areas that was less than satisfactory or we have eliminated those sales all together. So it\u2019s been a combination of those factors. Mark you want to add.", "Mark Rajkowski", "I think you guys said it well. Through the third quarter we either closed or significantly restructured 10 facilities and that\u2019s a significant amount of capacity either excess or unprofitable capacity that we have taken out of system. So that is a big part.", "Claudia Hueston \u2013 JPMorgan", "So if you think about margins and where they could go in that business over sort of a medium term, is there some sort of target that you have in mind or someplace you\u2019d like to be in terms of returns in that business?", "Mark Rajkowski", "I think what we have demonstrated is our ability in a sustainable way to improve the margin structure. As John said and I think this is essential to understanding what we are looking to do with our business models. We are making choices in terms of where we want to participate and where we do end up participating and where we will allocate capital in the future, will be in end markets that are profitable and are growing. So we\u2019ll continue to be disciplined on the cost side that business year-over-year through the third quarter is taken out almost 20% of it, it\u2019s SG&A and that\u2019s significant. So with that and the continued OpEx improvements that Jim alluded to with the right market participation choices, we see a substantial upside in terms of improving the margins in that business.", "Claudia Hueston \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. And then just to that end, where do you think you are in terms of profits that sort of going through your businesses and making these deliberate choices about the portfolio. Are the businesses that still don\u2019t fit or are there any competencies that you\u2019d like to have that you don\u2019t have right now?", "John A. Luke, Jr.", "I will ask the others to supplement what I say Claudia, but I think that we\u2019ve made tremendous progress over the past 12 months in making decisions that have both shaped our market participation as we have said and helped us determine where it is we can participate profitability and where we want to grow and emphasize. This is a discipline that is not a one time effort, it is a discipline that we are building into our D&A as if we\u2019re not that we haven\u2019t always looked at these but we\u2019ve got new disciplines and rigors that we are employing now. So this is an ongoing effort and I think frankly how certain businesses markets perform and the opportunities they represent is really pressure test and against where there is clearly an exceptionally difficult external environment will tell us a lot and help shape further decisions as we go forward.", "Claudia Hueston \u2013 JPMorgan", "Thank you.", "John A. Luke, Jr.", "Thank you Claudia.", "Operator", "And we go to the line of George Staphos from Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America", "Hi, everyone, good morning. Just wanted to continue with the consumer solutions theme. I think I heard you say that the healthcare packaging profit was up and that beverage was even or slightly up, to correct those or verify those and what were the trends for the other division that you will within consumer solutions from a profit standpoint. And as a related question is you\u2019ve done from your discussion a very good job of cutting the SG&A within the segments to improve profitability, are all divisions also showing increases in year-on-year gross profit, which would validate if you will your market choice discussion earlier John and then I had a couple follow-ons?", "James Buzzard", "Sure, George this is Jim. Healthcare profits were - actually profits in all the consumer segments were up including beverage. I think the reference I made on beverage was more of a revenue statement, but profitability was up nicely in that businesses as well. In terms of going forward, as we said we will continue to see improvements in all of those business, our gross margins were up across the board. So I think to your question of market participation, we are seeing not only the benefits of those decisions but also as we continue to drive the productivity initiatives as well.", "George L. Staphos \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay. Two quick follow-ons, beverage promotional activity depending on what month and what week we were hearing different things about the business, sometimes better sometimes worse. What\u2019s your sense on your customer\u2019s willingness to prompt more aggressively, specifically within the North American soft drink business? And then how much of your 2010th plan currently rests within consumer solution in total on your customers\u2019 willingness to launch new products?", "James A. Buzzard", "Sure George, in terms of beverage promotions, my sense has been that there has been less promotion. I think there has been a clear choice in the multi-pack business to go for price and margin by our customers at the expense of volume, and we felt that through the third quarter. To your second question in terms of our 2010 plans, we are not planning on significant launches by our customers. We certainly would be there to support them if those come, but our plans are built on what we expect to be a continued difficult environment going forward.", "John A. Luke Jr.", "Yeah, I would just add to that George. I think Jim, has characterized our planning exactly right having said that and as I commented innovation appropriately invested is something that we have sustained and it\u2019s proving to be an important competitive advantage, because while our customers with respect to their, their outlook and understandably. So I think to a customer we\u2019ve all found that there is great value of being placed on their own innovation activities recognizing that margin expansion is only going to come by bringing new things to their consumers that differentiate themselves and meet needs that others are not.", "George L. Staphos \u2013 Bank of America", "All right. Thanks. Quick one. I\u2019ll turn it over. Why am I not seeing a bigger drop in corporate expense looking at slide 16 given all the discussion on cost reduction and overhead reduction? Thanks guys. Good luck in the quarter.", "James A. Buzzard", "Thank you George.", "John A. Luke Jr.", "Yeah George. It\u2019s primarily related to accruals year-over-year in terms of incentive comp, we as performance decline last year, we started taking the incentive accruals down so we had credits and this year we have some provisions. So year-over-year and even quarter sequential, there is distorting that trend line.", "George L. Staphos \u2013 Bank of America", "Thanks very much.", "John A. Luke Jr.", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you. We\u2019ll go to the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Thank you. First, what are you seeing in your media business? Obviously it\u2019s good to see that improvement consumer solution. Are you seeing that in the media business or is there still a lot of work that needs to be done there?", "James A. Buzzard", "Mark, this is Jim. I think in the media business we are continuing to see volumes decline as DVD sales and music sales have fallen off and we certainly are impacted by that trend, as I mentioned I think we are gaining in share in that business as we have aligned ourselves with several of the strongest studios. But I think the real story there has been a lot around the cost we were talking about and I think we have, in all the areas that I referenced in my comments we\u2019ve done the same work in media and we will continue to focus on those same areas of that business going forward.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Is that basically a situation where you are going to be seeking to minimize any degradation or is it an area where you actually think you can turn it around and how that become a meaningful profit contributor again?", "James A. Buzzard", "Mark I think the markets will obviously play a large role and help us define that and we\u2019re still assessing exactly where those markets are going, but we will continue to do the same things we have been doing. So we\u2019ll focus on our cost, we\u2019ll focus on innovation, it\u2019s still at market that does appreciate innovation and new products. So we are investing in that and being there for our customers.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Okay thanks. And I apologize if you already went over this, but did you give us any sense on your cap spending plans for next year of mark.", "John A. Luke Jr.", "We\u2019re still in the middle of our planning cycle and a lot of that will be a function of what we see coming out us in terms of the economic climate.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Okay. And then lastly, can you update us where your pension plan is standing now?", "John A. Luke Jr.", "We are roughly a 130% overfunded as of the end of September.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Thank you.", "James A. Buzzard", "Thanks Mark.", "Operator", "Thank you. We\u2019ll go to line of Gail Glazerman with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "Hi, good morning. Well I heard the comments about year-over-year deflation and I was wondering if you could give some insights into how you see some of your key cost items moving sequentially into the fourth quarter and perhaps 2010?", "James A. Buzzard", "Sure, Gail. I think what we are going to begin to see in the fourth quarter is clearly oil prices have moved up, we\u2019re beginning to see some cost increases on outbound freight, certainly ocean being a big example. We\u2019re beginning to see with diesel cost up some impact in our wood cost as well. In other areas we are not yet seeing it broadly. I guess the one exception there would be our resin costs so sequentially we\u2019ve seen some increase in resin and our plastics business, but right now things seem to be flat on the basis of what we are looking at.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "Okay and just if you could make some further some comments on the balance sheet? I don\u2019t know Mark, if you want to handle this or John, but just remind us of any sort of debt goals that you might have and what priorities you might use for cash once you have reached that goal in terms of that?", "John A. Luke Jr.", "Yeah, let me just offer a couple of thoughts at the outset, Gail and make can follow on. I think that we made good progress in addressing some capital structure requirements as we move through 2000 or as we moved through 2009 and Mark alluded to in his comments and he can elaborate on they are part of an overall debt management efforts that we have underway. I think overall use of cash and management, I think one of the things that you would not be surprised of is the fact that given the continuing very limited visibility they relatively soft markets, its this going to be important for us to work to keep our powder very dry.", "James A. Buzzard", "Yeah and what I add to that Gail is that in the third quarter, we did use some cash to take down debt. We have certainly been working towards a leverage that\u2019s closer to 40% and we'll - as John said we want to keep our powder dry but if there are opportunities to that are attractive economically to de-lever than we'll look to do that.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "Okay, thank you. And just one last question on the consumer and office business, can you give a little bit more color the strengths and the momentum that you had in the third quarter or something you can continue in the fourth quarter? Is it some volume or strength that might have borrowed from the fourth quarter seasonally or any share gains sustainable?", "James A. Buzzard", "Gail, as I referenced in my comments we had a good back-to-school season, which ended in September and now we are moving into the calendar and the planning season those businesses historically are driven by white-collar employment and office formation, both of which are obviously much weaker year-on-year. So our sense is going to be that we\u2019ll continue to have pressure on the top line in Q4 in that business and clearly, we don\u2019t see the benefit of anything improving the envelope business at this point of time. So top line growth will be difficult and but we\u2019ll continue to focus on all the other areas that I reference from the cost standpoint and think we can continue to improve our margins.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We\u2019ll go to line of Mark Connelly with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.", "Mark Connelly \u2013 Sterne Agee", "Thank you. Two questions, first in specialty chemicals you referenced the benefits to stimulus activity overseas. I wonder as you look forward for that business, do you think that we\u2019re going to see significant FX sensitivity there? Obviously the stimulus has helped a lot, but I would imagine that the weak dollar is helping too and I am just curious how you are thinking as you look forward in that business about currency sensitivity. And then second question just on the Brazil acquisition I assume this is relatively small dollar amount. John, should we expect to see more of these small tuck-in acquisitions over the next six months or more opportunistically?", "John A. Luke Jr.", "Mark, let me answer that before turning to Mark on the \u2013 Mark and Jim on the other question. I think as Mark in a way suggested, I think we will look where there are opportunities, particularly that this economy provides for us to support our strategies against the business model discipline we\u2019re employing to make attractive small tuck-in acquisitions whether it\u2019s in a place like Brazil or elsewhere that will occur I think will be measured in that activity but while we don\u2019t have any meaningful plans before as right now they will come along. And, so I think you can expect to see them and not be surprised into your point, small, Mark?", "Mark Rajkowski", "", "As far as the impact of the currency on our specialty chemicals business, you know that certainly a weaker dollar doesn\u2019t hurt in terms of obviously pricing and non-U.S. locations however those products that we sell from our specialty chemicals business are really sold based upon value, and so it\u2019s not as much a currency game as it is a winning value proposition. So the impact, at least so far has been negligible.", "", "John A. Luke Jr.", "", "Anything else Mark.", "Mark Connelly \u2013 Sterne Agee", "", "No, that\u2019s good. Thank you.", "", "John A. Luke Jr.", "", "Thank you.", "", "Operator", "", "And we\u2019ll go to line of Peter Ruschmeier from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.", "Peter Ruschmeier \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "Thanks, and congratulations on a very strong quarter. I want to ask a couple of questions. Just as a follow-up to Gail\u2019s question on cost, you mentioned that you had lower wood, freight and resin cost, but those are gone back up, but yet they are flattish. Does that mean they had been going down and now they are back up, net-net they are back to where they started from?", "James A. Buzzard", "No, Pete let me clarify that, the cost were down year-on-year. What I referenced was what we\u2019re beginning to see was the run-up in oil prices and diesel cost. Some freight impact primarily on inbound wood and our outbound freight and of course resin cost have begun to climb, but there is still below where they were a year ago.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "And if I add up the various slides in terms of deflation, I guess it\u2019s deflation and productivity by segment it looks like $83 million year-on-year benefit; I\u2019m curious to the extent you can help us to understand a sequential basis what that looked like and should we expect that to unwind a little bit as early in the fourth quarter?", "Mark Rajkowski", "Yeah, Pete, as we look at the fourth quarter as Jim said, while we are starting to see a little bit of flattening in terms of some of the input cost and couple of instances some increases, year-over-year in the fourth quarter we will see similar rates of decline that we saw in the third quarter, okay? So while sequentially things are flattening to maybe up in a couple of those categories year-over-year we are still going to see substantial inflation and on the productivity side, this has been something that Jim and the team have been driving hard. I think the results speak for themselves through the first nine months and we fully expect to see similar levels of OpEx productivity in Q4 and beyond.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And Jim I was hoping you could provide an update on what do you seeing in the packaging machinery business, how is it operating, what\u2019s your outlook for that business going forward?", "James A. Buzzard", "As you know those, that business is tied to our beverage business primarily, and we\u2019re continuing to invest in placements of new machines for our customers around the globe. And as I referenced to our growth in some of the emerging markets is where we are seeing real opportunity to take this whole solution and enter the emerging markets and help our customer dramatically grow there. So continuing a pace with where it\u2019s been, and we expect to continue that way in 2010.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Okay. And maybe just lastly on your strategic cost management program, I am curious if you could help us to understand, of the 16 facilities you rationalized, presumably some of that business that you didn't want and some of the business perhaps you transferred other facilities. How much revenue leakage is there obviously it\u2019s a good P&L choice but how much of the revenue do you keep versus how much the revenues do you just take a pass on?", "Mark Rajkowski", "You know I think it certainly going to vary by business but as we look at the capacity that we have taken out relative to choices we have made in terms of products and certain customers, the impact is in the low to mid single-digits so it\u2019s certainly is having an impact but it\u2019s in that range.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Very helpful. Thanks very much.", "John A. Luke, Jr", "Thank you. Pete", "Operator", "Thank you. We will go to line of Chip Dillon from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Hi, good morning.", "John A. Luke, Jr", "Good morning, Chip.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Credit Suisse", "First question is on, just if you could just review, this is more for Mark but on the black liquor credits it looks like you are making a full \u2013 statutory accrual for those. My guess would be that you haven\u2019t paid any cash taxes against that just looking at the deferred tax line going up on the balance sheet, but what do you think the ultimate taxability in cash terms would be of that and again could you just verify that you really haven\u2019t being paying cash taxes based on that credit.", "Mark Rajkowski", "In terms of the accounting, we book it as we earn it so while most of that credit has been reflected in the form of cash receipts we do have somewhere where we have made accruals at the end of the third quarter. In terms of taxes, that\u2019s really a function of our overall tax position in U.S. and we are beginning to pay some taxes as we found ourselves in a taxable position in the U.S. now through improved operations as well as some benefit from those credits.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Got you. And when you look at the tremendous improvement for example in resources \u2013 25 million sequentially I know the reais had jumped up about 20%, 25% I know it\u2019s up from January. Would you say maybe a third of that improvement sequentially could have been just the appreciation in reais or would that be too strong?", "Mark Rajkowski", "I think that\u2019s too strong. But there is certainly been some benefit, I think when you look at it on average, year-over-year as you look across the entire quarter I think for us as we look at that it\u2019s probably around 10% or so.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Got you. And then the last question is on the bleached board side, it looks like you are running about 19% less production than last year and I know you just took machine down at Evandale. Could you talk little bit about why demand may be that much slower and it is lot of tied to your decisions to get out of some of the lower-end let\u2019s say cub stock areas?", "James A. Buzzard", "Chip, this is Jim. A whole host of reasons obviously the economy both in terms of reduced consumption as well our customers destocking and taking inventories out has had an impact. I think we are seeing material substitution so in some cases CNK grades replacing SBS. To your point there clearly is some market participation, decisions we have made around the closure of E-2. So I think those three things are impacting our volumes, but I would say in the markets that we've elected to participate in, we are certainly holding our position very well. ", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Gotcha. Thank you very much. ", "John A. Luke, Jr.", "Thank you Chip.", "Operator", "We'll go to the line of Richard Skidmore from Goldman Sachs. Please go-ahead. ", "Richard Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Good morning guys. And just really two quick questions. First is we look at 5/13 the net operating productivity of $28 million year-over-year would that be more like $50 million as you expect if you looked at the fourth quarter? I guess what I'm getting at is that you talked about a $140 million of productivity and your original target I think was 120. ", "Mark Rajkowski", "", "Rick on that, we have got to make sure we're not mixing apples and oranges. What that $140 relates to specifically is the overhead cost reductions and the benefits from rationalizing our manufacturing capacity. So if you looked at slide 13, you see overhead and capacity actions of $44 million. So that\u2019s what that relates to and as we get into the fourth quarter, we expect that to continue to build.", "Richard Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay, it\u2019s something closer to $65 or something as you go into the next quarter?", "Mark Rajkowski", "", "Well I kind of helped you do the math because $90 million through Q3 and we expect to be at around $140 through the full year. ", "Richard Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay and then just a follow-up to that would be as you look at on the productivity gains that you have made and the deflation that you have seen in the business. What have you been doing with your sales people to ensure that pricing is not given back and you away some of this margin improvement that you have been seeing?", "John A. Luke, Jr.", "Yeah Rick, John. Let me just pick that up. I think across the board with the strategies we've been shaping, the business model discipline we have put in place, in those areas where we have consciously chosen to maintain or increase our participation. Strategies to participate wherever possible with a very disciplined focus on being rewarded for the value that we bring, ensuring that margins are maintained or expanded in the phase of cost pressures has been in every single one of our businesses an absolute priority. It\u2019s awfully easy to fall into the trap of looking at an economy like this and wanting to reduce prices. We have seen that in years going by and clearly in more commoditized businesses the market forces can drive that. I think our discipline and the appeal to us of more attractive markets lets us target those areas where those pressures have minimized and the discipline with which we work with our sales leadership to ensure that, that is maintained is something we address almost on a daily basis. ", "Richard Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Operator", "Thank you, and at this time there are no questions in questions in queue.", "Jason Thompson", "Thanks everyone for joining us. We look forward to speaking with you guys next quarter. Stacy, if you could please give the replay information now. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Welcome to MWV fourth quarter and full year 2009 conference call. All lines are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. All instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's conference call will be recorded.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Jason Thompson. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jason Thompson", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. This morning we announced our results before the market opened. Notification of this morning's call was broadly disclosed. Further this morning's call is being webcast at mwv.com and slides that accompany this call are available there as well.", "I will briefly remind you that certain statements we make are forward-looking and are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties described in our public filings. Furthermore, contents contain time sensitive information that although correct today, may change with the passage of time.", "First, a brief recap of the results we reported this morning. For the fourth quarter, we reported net income of 51 million or $0.29 per share. These results include net favorable after tax items totaling 13 million or $0.07 per share.", "Now here to tell you more about our results for the fourth quarter and the full year are John Luke, Chairman and CEO, Jim Buzzard, President, and Mark Rajkowski, CFO. I will now turn the call over to John.", "John Luke", "Jason, thanks very much and good morning. 2009 was a good year for MWV and the environment that was difficult for our industry and the broader economy. We set a course to manage through a challenging and uncertain economic period and we executed on those plans. Improved earnings and increased shareholder value by focusing on sound strategy, strategies that worked and will enhance our overall competitiveness. This work continues.", "We have made choices about marketplace participation that have both increased our earnings and positioned us for greater profitability going forward. We have made improvements to our business model that have had immediate impact on bottom line results and importantly that will provide us greater operating leverage as demand event eventually improve. And we have preserved and strengthened our sound financial position making us standout as a stable and reliable partner for our customers in an uncertain environment while also giving flexibility to invest in future growth for and with those customers.", "Continued progress in these areas in 2010 is a high priority. In a few moments, Jim will talk about our strong operational performance during the fourth quarter and the dynamics we obtain in our markets. And then, Mark will highlight some of the financial metrics and outline our financial priorities as we move into 2010.", "Before turning to them, I wanted to elaborate briefly on a few aspects of our fourth quarter performance that punctuate the progress we have made on our value creation strategies during the year.", "First, we continue to strengthen partnerships with customers and to capitalize on our strengths to win business with new customers. We're helping major beverage customers take advantage of a growing market for multi-pack packaging in Asia and we added new customers during the quarter for Shellpak, Natralock, MWare and other innovative offerings across our marketplace market place.", "Second, our aggressive cost and productivity initiatives have resulted in a more competitive business model. We expanded margins in each of our businesses during the fourth quarter capping off the year were MWV's overall operating profitability improved significantly. This has been a dedicated and determined effort across the company. We reached our immediate targets and have set our sights additional improvements going forward.", "Finally, our financial strength continues to be a valuable asset for all of our businesses. And it has allowed to us meet our commitments to both customers and shareholders through a very uncertain year. We added more cash to our balance sheet during the fourth quarter and we're gratified that we preserved and increased shareholder value during this tremendously difficult period.", "As we look forward, we're expecting continuation of the same challenges we have been facing and increasingly stable but still weak economy, as consumers and cautious customers and public policies that may stifle rather than stimulate economic growth. Despite the still uncertain market outlook, we're confident, however, we're focused on the right things.", "MWV's strategy for 2010 is built on the principle that drove our positive results in 2009. We're already working hard on another series of deliberate actions that will further strengthen our business including the priority emphasis on growth and developing geographies, especially Brazil, organic growth in our most attractive end-markets, particularly healthcare packaging and additional reductions in our cost structure and refinement store overall market participation. With continued vigilant in these areas and many more, we'll build on our recent performance record and generate additional positive momentum in 2010.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Buzzard to talk about our business results in the fourth quarter before Mark discusses our financial metrics and a more detailed outlook for the first quarter as well. Jim?", "Jim Buzzard", "Thank you, John. I am pleased to say that the tremendous work we put in both our operational performance and commercial strategies this year delivered strong results. We have taken significant steps toward our goal of world class costs and productivity performance and we're demonstrating the market knowledge and commercial excellence that will be required to turn the operating leverage we created into dramatically improved earnings results as markets improve.", "Our progress this year has been apparent even in this difficult economic environment. Sales were down about 9% across the company for the year and yet, we've increased earnings from our business segments by 24% compared to 2008. We're beginning to see some early positive signs from customers. No one expects a dramatic recovery in the near future. However, many of our markets have stabilized and we're seeing some year-over-year improvements in order patterns.", "As we have noted throughout the year, our business in consumer staples such as food, beverage, healthcare and home and garden has held up as well as you might expect during this economic downturn where as the luxury and consumer discretionary categories have seen more protracted declines including personal care, fragrance and entertainment. The commercial organization we built over the past year continues to provide improved visibility into these market dynamics. And our value based assessment in each of our businesses has us focused on the right strategic opportunities in the most attractive end-markets for our products and services.", "As these trends continue in our markets gain momentum, we are positioned to capitalize on our improved operating leverage. In anticipation of the severe economic challenges, we took steps to speed up and resize our strategic cost management program. We exceeded our targets for overhead cost savings in 2009 adding together overhead cost savings, capacity actions and ongoing plant productivity initiatives that total impact from our cost management program was more than $275 million this year. And in 2010, we expect to deliver an additional 3 to 4% of operating productivity improvement.", "Let me share some details about the impact of our commercial strategies and operating productivity actions on each of our businesses and consumer packaging markets. As always, you will find additional information in the slide presentation at the company's for this call.", "In the packaging resources business, segment profits were down only slightly during the fourth quarter despite volume decreases due to the economy, inventory control and our decision to exit certain low return business. Pricing was up year-over-year and we experienced some modest cost deflation. However, this was offset by the impact of lost volumes.", "As a result, profits were down about 11% for the quarter and 7% for the year. Given the very difficult year in 2009, this was a great effort by our team. Compared to last year's fourth quarter, shipments of SBS were down 16% but were essentially flat versus the third quarter.", "CNK volumes were down 9% compared to last year as several beverage customers delayed taking shipments in order to balance year-end inventories. We're gaining market share in key value-added paperboard markets, especially commercial print, tobacco in China and Japan and aseptic liquid packaging across Asia.", "We've also had good traction with the recent launch of MWare line of food service products and new business from our effort to work with brand owners to specify our products for their offerings in food markets.", "In addition, Rigesa continues to maintain its profitability with strong productivity gains. Our business in Brazil rebounded more quickly than elsewhere in the world and we expect the recovery we have seen over the past several months to continue. These trends should be a tail wind for Rigesa in 2010.", "The consumer solutions segment had another strong quarter to finish on a much improved year. Profits doubled in this business during the fourth quarter from $11 million in 2008 to $22 million in 2009. And profits for the year were up 70%. The team has done a good job reducing costs, eliminating unprofitable products and seeking out opportunities to win with our customers in an environment that still saw a 10% overall decline in sales for the year. The rate of decline moderate rated in the fourth quarter. Our markets have stabilized and some of our customers are beginning to sound more optimistic about demand in 2010.", "Let me go through each of the consumer packaging markets we serve in this business and give you a sense of the performance in the quarter. Our global beverage business, sales and earnings increased again during the fourth quarter, in part thanks to new business in Asia as well as outstanding productivity at our operating facilities. Our business in China was up 50% this year and our customers are firmly focused on this region for their future growth.", "Our business in China was up 50% this year and our customers are firmly focused on this region for their future growth. We are pursuing additional opportunities to grow with these customers by helping them win with our proprietary products and machinery both in traditional multi-pack markets as well as new in the adjacent categories.", "Meanwhile, trends in the beer and soft drink business in North America and Europe have remained relatively stable. We're still seeing resiliency for beer in North America and we have even had a small increase in volume for carbonated soft drink which has generally been declining the past few quarters.", "In our healthcare business, sales and earnings were up for the year. The focus of this business continues to be on our Shellpak solution and other adhering packing as well as valuable pumps for pharmaceuticals requiring Nasal or Oral applications. We increased our Shellpak volume from about 3 million units per month at the beginning of the year to more than 7 million units per month in the fourth quarter by adding new drugs for Wal-Mart's generic prescription program and add a new brand in generic pharmaceutical customers.", "There is also been some moderate improvement in the market for our preservative free pumps in Europe as customers restock inventory and consider the benefits of this innovative application. We've added new customers for this solution as well during the quarter, including our first two customers in India. These innovative products as well as the recently launched Med-Easy package we introduced in Europe and North America will be the central focus of our growing healthcare business in 2010.", "We have begun to see a small amount of progress in the global markets for personal care. Sales were up during the fourth quarter compared to last year when the bottom really fell out of the luxury product sector and they are beginning to emerge from a very difficult year in this business with positive momentum. We have heard from fragrance customers who are beginning to restock inventories as well as considering new launches for their product pipelines and we continue to benefit from an increased emphasis on healthy habits involving hand soaps and sanitizers.", "We remain excited about opportunities for our innovative airless pump dispensers, a solution that helps customer lower their costs and manage their supply chains by avoiding the need to add preservatives to their formula. As in our other businesses, we have taken aggressive action to reduce costs, resize our manufacturing footprint and increase productivity in the personal care business which has helped improve margins and raise profits during the fourth quarter and the entire year.", "In home and garden, activity remains positive in advance of the all important lawn and garden maintenance season in the United States. Sales and earnings were about even in the fourth quarter and profitability was up significantly for the entire year. We have benefited from an upward trend in home and hard surface cleaning solutions this year and recently secured an extended contract with a refresh trigger sprayer we provide for Procter & Gamble's popular Febreze product.", "As I noted before, we're actively managing our media and entertainment business for maximum cash generation and doing so very successfully. Sales continue to decline in this business, especially for printed media and specialty packaging. And we've taken actions to rationalize capacity and costs as a result.", "Sales are still relatively strong for injection-molded products including our popular EcoLite DVD and Blu-Ray cases, as we've emerged as one of only a small handful of suppliers to the major studios. We also continue to make inroads into consumer electronics and other markets with our Natralock security packaging. The team was recently at the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas and announced several new customers for this innovative packaging including Kodak and Swiss Army. This business should continue to expand nicely in 2010.", "Turning to our non-packaging businesses, our positive earnings momentum has continued in both the consumer and office products and specialty chemicals segments. Coming off of some historic lows last year, the consumer and office products segment had another solid performance in the fourth quarter to finish a very good year. We continue to benefit from strong placement and sell through for proprietary branded consumer and office products at leading North American retailers and distributors. Our alignment and collaboration with these winning retailers led to volume increases for the all important back-to-school and year-end planning seasons in this business.", "Along with some significant productivity improvements, these volume gains contributed to a strong increase in profitability for the consumer office product segment during both the quarter and the year. While the Brazilian back-to-school season is just underway, we had good initial placement for Tilibra and Grafons whose high-end stationary products we acquired to extend our reach in the attractive Brazilian market. The integration of Grafons is well underway and is expected to contribute to earnings in 2010.", "Sales increased slightly in specialty chemical segments and the business posted another increase in earnings compared to a weak fourth quarter in 2008. Despite the difficult economy, we reported strong sales in several markets including asphalt, printing ink, adhesives and absorption technologies for water treatment which set a record for sales in the year.", "Our auto coverage business was also stronger than expected, as North American manufacturers increased production slightly and sales in Asia nearly reached an all-time high. We continue to see momentum for our asphalt pavement products around the world, including commitments in China to use Evotherm for cold weather paving.", "Market conditions for the community development and land management segment continue as they have throughout 2009. The overall real estate market was soft, but there was some momentum in our current area of emphasis, small rural land tracks. We closed 11 of these smaller transactions during the quarter with an average price per acre of more than $2,100. Similar to last quarter, we also closed a larger force land sale in South Carolina, more than 10,000 acres for a total of $18 million. In total land sales during the quarter were more than $23 million and were the primary contributor to segment earnings of $20 million.", "We continue to make progress in our development activities as well. We unveiled the master plan for our large East Edisto property which was met with a very positive reaction from the community in South Carolina. We're already working with local governments on long-term development agreements and infrastructure plans and we expect that work to continue through 2010.", "We also signed the previously announced lease agreement with a tenant for our industrial and distribution park joint venture with the Rockefeller Group serving the Port of Charleston. We are actively pursuing prospective tenants for a second site on this property as well as other industrial and development projects. The long-term dynamics for these properties are very strong, especially with the recent announcement that Boeing will open a second assembly plant for their Dreamliner aircraft in the North Charleston area and bring as many as 10 to 15 suppliers to the region along with them.", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss some of our financial metrics for the fourth quarter. Mark?", "Mark Rajkowski", "Thanks, Jim. During the fourth quarter, we continued to execute the game plan we laid out at the beginning of 2009 to improve our business model and strengthen our financial position. We had a strong finish to what was a year of substantial progress. As a result, we delivered increased earnings and cash flow in both the fourth quarter and full year. More importantly, the improvements we have made to our cost structure and financial flexibility provide us with an excellent foundation on which to build the 2010.", "Consider these highlights from 2009. We expanded operating margins in each of our businesses, resulting in 170 basis point improvement in the company's operating margins year-over-year. We permanently eliminated more than $150 million of overhead and fixed manufacturing costs and we continue to make our cost structure more competitive. And we generated over $870 million of operating cash flow and added about $300 million of cash to our balance sheet. We achieved this during one of the most difficult economic environments ever. This is a record of accomplishment of which we are proud, but not satisfied. Our plans for 2010 build on this progress and momentum.", "Let's take a closer look at these areas of our performance. We expanded our gross margin in each of our businesses. On an adjusted basis, we saw a total gross margin improvement of 360 basis points and 240 basis points in the fourth quarter and full year respectively. This margin improvement reflects both a significant cost savings we generated from our over head and manufacturing capacity actions, as well as the enhanced product mix we achieved for more focused market participation strategies that emphasize higher margin products.", "Much of our success during the year was driven by determined effort to implement our strategic cost management program. During the fourth quarter we generated an additional $64 million of savings from the reduction of overhead and fixed manufacturing costs.", "For the year total costs savings were $154 million, which we achieved by closing or restructuring 16 facilities and eliminating almost 3,000 positions which is 13% of our global workforce. As a result of this progress and ongoing work to further reduce overhead costs, we continue to expect at least $250 million of one rate savings by the middle of this year.", "In the fourth quarter our SG&A spend was reduced $35 million related to our over head cost savings. This represents a 20% reduction compared to the previous year. And we will continue to benefit from these savings going forward.", "These reductions however, were more than offset by higher performance based compensation as a substantial portion of these full year costs were accrued in the fourth quarter. Higher earnings and our ongoing working capital discipline contributed to an excellent year of cash flow generation.", "Excluding the impact from the alternative fuel credits and other special items, cash flow from operations was about $640 million. That's an improvement of almost 50% over 2008. Free cash flow which is cash after CapEx, dividends was $258 million.", "We had $850 million of cash-on-hand at the end of 2009, also a substantial improvement. We leveraged the strong cash performance with actions to further improve our liquidity and financial flexibility. 2009 we reduced outstanding debt by over $200 million, exiting the year with a total debt to capital ratio of 39%.", "We also took advantage of the improved credit markets to greatly increase our overall financial flexibility by optimizing our debt maturity schedule and renewing our $600 million credit facility. Our financial strength has been a clear advantage in a tough environment. We have continued to invest in innovation, we have won business with new customers looking for reliability and stability in their supply chains and of course we were able to maintain our industry leading dividend for our shareholders.", "As we look ahead to 2010, we expect another challenging year with an uneven global economic recovery. While we expect continued steady growth in Brazil, China and India, high unemployment, ongoing tight credit, a weak housing market and rising saving levels are likely to continue to depress US economic growth this year.", "While demand has stabilized at current levels and in some markets is beginning to pick up from the lows we experienced in 2009, resiliency and trajectory of these trends through this year remains unclear. As such we are continuing to focus on the key controllables in maintaining the priority that drove our success in 2009, improving our business model, enhancing our financial strength and selectively investing capital to profitably grow our business.", "Turning to the first quarter outlook, we expect our businesses to experience typical seasonality, but we are seeing some favorable volume trends as we begin to compare to the severe declines we saw at this time last year. Backlogs at the mills are stronger and customer tone and other key packaging markets has become more positive. As a result, we expect volumes to improve modestly year-over-year.", "We also expect our results in the first quarter to benefit from the full run rate of the overhead in fixed manufacturing cost savings we achieved in 2009, as well as some moderation of input costs compared to last year's first quarter.", "Taking into account all of these factors, we expect higher year-over-year earnings in each of our business segments, with the exception of our community development and land management business which benefited last year from a single large land sale. With that, John, I will turn it back to you.", "John Luke", "Mark, thanks very much. In summary, MWV ended the year with solid performance in the fourth quarter. We set a course at the beginning of 2009 to strengthen our competitiveness, even in a difficult and uncertain economic environment. We followed that course executing on plans to reduce costs, refine market price participation and build financial strength. These actions helped improve our earnings results, increase shareholder value and generate considerable momentum to our operations as we head further into 2010.", "This concludes our prepared comments this morning and we would now be happy to answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Claudia Hueston with JP Morgan.", "Claudia Hueston \u2013 JP Morgan", "Thanks very much. Good morning.", "Jim Buzzard", "Good morning, Claudia.", "Claudia Hueston \u2013 JP Morgan", "Jim, I think you said that some of your customers in the consumer solutions business were beginning to sound more optimistic. Just hoping you could elaborate on that and maybe characterize if there is any similarities, any particular businesses or regions there where you're seeing that optimism?", "Jim Buzzard", "Sure, Claudia. As I think I noted, we are beginning to hear customers, at least sounded a little more positive tone. We're seeing that certainly as they are restocking some of their inventories, the destocking we saw last year has stopped and they're actually beginning to move back into the supply chain. In areas like the fragrance business, we have seen an uptick in orders and we're hearing customers talk about the fact that they're looking at new launches, nothing definitive yet but they're beginning to see opportunities to grow their business.", "Other areas within personal care continue to be positive year-over-year. And we're also seeing obviously the benefit I think of some of our innovative packaging solutions in the healthcare markets, we're seeing good opportunities there. I think our strength in emerging markets, China, Brazil, Eastern Europe, India are all helping leverage things as well. And then we have made some moves with our CNK products into the food markets, where we bring some real values, especially in the frozen food areas as well, so really across the board we're seeing better tone and tenor. We're not here to declare victory and say that we're seeing real strength in the markets, but certainly feeling better than we did this time last year.", "Claudia Hueston \u2013 JP Morgan", "That's helpful color. And then just with respect to some of these emerging markets and opportunities for growth, can you talk a little bit more about the strategy as you think about emerging markets and what sort of your criteria is as you're thinking about growth in those regions?", "Jim Buzzard", "I think that clearly our focus has been on Brazil, China, India and Eastern Europe, so we put capital into those regions, so we have manufacturing capabilities in each of those areas. And I think it is the same philosophy we have taken in North America and Western Europe. It is, with what sort of packaging solutions can we provide to leading global brand owners to bring value to them and help them succeed in their markets.", "And so whether it's growth in multi-pack packaging in China, where we're seeing certainly the large beverage companies make significant investments, whether it is in the personal care markets and whether it is in specialty chemicals, all of those areas we continue to participate and bring value to our customers. I think one of the things that sets us apart is that we can supply the global brand owners anywhere in the world, that they choose to participate and we're doing that.", "John Luke", "Claudia, good morning, this is John. I would just supplement what Jim is saying because I think that implicit in everything we're saying is a very disciplined focus towards managing investment marketplace participation, all with a view towards participating in areas where there are decided opportunities for to us bring value and get rewarded as we grow profitably in those markets and let that guide the discipline in and around the investments we make. I think we are, as Jim reinforced uniquely well-positioned but it is a very carefully thought out approach toward building markets.", "Claudia Hueston \u2013 JP Morgan", "Thank you. That's very helpful and then just two little ones. Could you provide some CapEx and tax rate guidance for 2010?", "John Luke", "Mark, you're on.", "Mark Rajkowski", "Yeah, Claudia, in terms of CapEx as you know 2009 we were very much focused on preserving capital and maintaining liquidity. So as we look at this year's spend, certainly some delays and deferrals of projects to preserve cash, so we would expect to see some tick up in our CapEx in 2010. The other thing that certainly we want to do is to take advantage of some of the strength that we have in key end markets and some of the emerging geographies as Jim was talking about earlier and we're not going to get ahead of the recovery, but where we see opportunities to profitably grow our business we'll take advantage of that as well, so certainly some modest increases over the level of spend that we had this year.", "Claudia Hueston \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay. And the tax rate?", "Mark Rajkowski", "Tax rate, this is, to pinpoint that is a difficult thing but I think a range to think about is somewhere in the 25 to 30% range.", "Claudia Hueston \u2013 JP Morgan", "Perfect. Thanks a lot.", "Mark Rajkowski", "Thank you, Claudia.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Connelly with Sterne, Agee. Your line is open.", "Mark Connelly \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "Thank you, John. Wonder, if we could talk about consumer solutions in terms of the Calmar business and I am wondering as we move into the spring whether you see enough signs of recovery in the higher end spray pump business to offset potential seasonal losses, Purell has helped you a lot through this period and I am curious whether you're seeing any signs the rest of that market is coming back or whether you think that the Purell business might continue to hold you through?", "John Luke", "Mark, I will start and I will turn to Jim to provide a little bit more color. I think we continue to see good focus on the Purell type business in response to all of the concerns and market development as a result that it's come from that. I think the nature of our participation in the pumps and dispensers marketplace and the innovation that we bring to bear has helped us to be nicely positioned to play in every day as well as higher end markets. Jim, as I said will elaborate a little bit more definitively but I think that we are seeing opportunities for recovery to be more manifest. Because I think as we reinforced across the board, we are cautious. Our customers are cautious. They feel a little better than they did a year ago, but this remains an uncertain time and it would be difficult to predict what the marketplace and economic environment would really look like beyond I guess beyond the next several weeks, no less what would it look like six months from now but Jim can provide a little bit more color on what we're seeing.", "Jim Buzzard", "Sure, Mark. As we sit here today and look forward again with caveat as John said that it's a visibility not all that transparent to our customers, a couple things going on. We certainly were supported in 2009 by the Purell, short of soap dispensing and antibacterial products, but we also believe there has been a permanent change in consumer habits. And so while it will certainly come back from the levels, we saw in 2009, we do believe that it will be a permanent uptick, for what it has been in prior years just as consumer behaviors have changed. We are seeing as we enter the lawn and garden season for the high-end tools applicators which are good products for us, strong order patterns there and then as I referenced in personal care markets particularly fragrance, we are seeing improved tenor from our customers and that is being reflected in stronger order patterns as we enter 2010.", "Mark Connelly \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "Well, the market doesn't seem to see the strength that we see in these numbers today. Question for Mark Rajkowski perhaps, you talk about the cash build and I look and say, you've now got more than 50% of a quarter's cash sitting there, probably earning not a whole lot of money. I am starting to wonder, how much of a cash cushion do you really need? Obviously you have talked about incremental investment requirements, but what are you going to do with that lump of cash because ultimately it is a significant drag on earnings right now?", "Mark Rajkowski", "I would say that first of all, I am not sure we're completely out of the woods yet. While trends are improving, some of the factors I cited earlier in my comments are factors that get us a little bit cautious about the U.S. economic recovery.", "Secondly, I think just as we did in 2009 we're going to continue to be balanced while maintaining flexibility. So, we certainly think maintaining a strong payout to our shareholders is important. We're going to look at opportunistically and economically taking down some debt where that makes sense. And as I said earlier, we really while not getting ahead of the recovery, want to put some of that capital to work to profitably grow our business and take advantage of the market strength that we have in a number of our end markets and geographies.", "John Luke", "Yeah. I would just dovetail on that, Mark and say that what Mark has characterized as a situation that is the very beneficial outcome of uncertainty and a real priority on liquidity that we established at the outset of 2009. We have worked hard. We have improved these levels of cash all while maintaining the dividend and managing the debt appropriately. And we're actively looking, as Mark indicated, at plans. But I think really before too many triggers are pulled, it's very, very important to understand the nature and sustainability of any economic recovery as we move through the coming, hopefully the coming weeks and the next few months.", "Mark Connelly \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "I think that's obviously fair. My point was more that your internal performance has improved so dramatically that if you're confident in this performance level that you're starting to get to a point where you're just not going to need a cushion this big, anyway.", "John Luke", "And you can be sure, we're thinking about those things. We're not declaring victory either with internal performance, as Mark said, we're gratified but as we look forward and we raise the bar, we're not satisfied. We've got more to do as well. But the momentum exists.", "Mark Connelly \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "Very helpful. Thank you.", "John Luke", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Gail Glazerman with UBS.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "Hi. Good morning. Can you please talk a little bit about how you see inflation moving into 2010, compared to the second half of 2009 and any particular area that you're concerned about?", "Mark Rajkowski", "We certainly have seen continued benefits from moderating inflation throughout the course of 2009. I think we were about break even year-over-year. In the first quarter, that ramped up to 4%. In the second quarter and I think we were at around 9%, in the fourth quarter of this year as we had some easier compares. We do expect to continue to see moderating inflation costs year-over-year in the first quarter, but as we move throughout the course of the year, those compares get a little bit tougher. And certainly one of the areas that we've got our eye on is freight costs. We expect them to pick up over the course of the year. But all in for 2010, we're expecting a relatively moderate inflation climate, so not a significant increase year-over-year.", "John Luke", "Again, I think Mark has characterized the look, Gail, towards 2010. We're not economists, so as we look out and plan I think the actions that have been taken in Washington do give us concern about the prospects for inflation to pick up at some point. And so, looking at the model that Mark has outlined, you can be sure that we're going to be very guarded about what could potentially come in the period.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Thank you. And just coming back to the idea of growth, are we supposed to think of it as kind of more of what you have been doing in terms of the acquisition in Brazil and things like that? Or would we expect something maybe a little bigger and more dramatic in 2010?", "John Luke", "I think the others can comment more of what we have been doing, they sense for the pedestrian. I think we got a lot going on and it has been very positive. But I don't think you should expect any dramatic moves, any major moves. What we want to do is, we would continue to build the momentum in the refinement and the execution of our strategy agenda. Again, all geared to generate sustained levels of profitable growth. And that, as you heard Jim describe more fully, is the consumer and office product position in Brazil could be replicated whether it is in Brazil or in other areas. We do not have on our screen and therefore don't anticipate any major moves.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Thank you. And just one last question, Mark, you made a comment about higher performance-based compensation in the fourth quarter. Can you quantify that at all or if you did, I am sorry I missed it.", "Mark Rajkowski", "I didn't quantify that. But, I think we've got a waterfall chart in there somewhere that gives you relative order of magnitude for the year. And a sizable portion of that was year-over-year impact in the fourth quarter.", "Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Thank you.", "John Luke", "Thanks, Gail.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Thank you. Two questions. First, in the past we talked about the media business as being a top priority in terms of improving. Can you give us an update of where things stand with that and if there is still more actions, et cetera, you think you can or should be taking there? Let's start with that, please.", "Mark Rajkowski", "Let me, I'll take the lead and Jim can add some more color. We made significant changes in that businesses cost structure during the past year. Our overhead costs reductions were upwards of 25% plus year-over-year which were ahead of volume declines. And as Jim said earlier, we have been really focused on generating cash from that business, so we stripped out a lot of costs. We've taken out a lot of capacity. And, year-over-year it has actually been a positive cash generator. I think we have made outstanding progress in restructuring that business this year.", "Jim Buzzard", "I think Mark, as I noted in my comments on the plastic side of the business, we have seen a competitor or two exit and so we are in a much stronger position there. The print side remains very competitive. And if we continue to see further volume declines, we will continue to take the actions necessary to match our capacity with the demand.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Great. And then in the past, you had talked about setting the real estate business up into a position where market conditions being appropriate, you could potentially spin it or do something whereby it would become a stand-alone entity. I recognize that market conditions may not be appropriate yet for such an action, but have you put in place the capabilities? And have you been putting in place the capabilities so that when the market timing is appropriate, you could be quickly responsive to it?", "John Luke", "Let me answer it this way. I think we've put in place great capabilities and we have built strong plans that we're executing on. That should not as an answer suggest that we determine what the future structure should be. But we have really built a very good business that is not only generating revenues, as we reported today from land sales and is positioned to do so with joint ventures like the Rockefeller Group who is well-positioned, building on those kinds of joint ventures to capitalize on the commercial industrial development that may, it is under way in the low country of South Carolina and maybe spurred further by the moves associated with Boeing move that Jim talked about.", "And then we're broadly, we have a series of initiatives underway, not limited to the East Edisto project which is substantial in its own right to develop similar master plans around which we can build understanding through community engagement and support. And all of this is adding value to that business for MWV shareholders at a time when, as you noted in your question, market conditions more broadly in the United States for real estate are pretty peeked.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "That's helpful and I understand that no decisions have been made. Maybe it belongs as part of MeadWestvaco over the long haul. At the same time, I do think at one point, you had talked about creating standalone capabilities so that you would have optionality. And I guess it's just the question, would you say at this juncture that the real estate business is a standalone business? Or is it still integrated pretty significantly into the MeadWestvaco as a whole?", "John Luke", "Without implying that it would have a separate structure, at least from entity standpoint, it is increasingly a stand alone business as it grows and develops these huge capabilities. Where the integration comes is that we have our forestry business as a portion of that, so there is a linkage to our land ownership for those purposes and certainly the fiber supply to our Mills. If you were to look at this from a purely clinical standpoint, the capability that's being built, the business model that is being shaped and strategy agenda that is being set are arguably would have it to be a separate structure that can stand on its own.", "Jim Buzzard", "We've got full capability in that business in terms of management. And they've got their own systems, so the answer is yes. I mean, they are very much in a position where we could have that optionality.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Okay. Thank you.", "Jim Buzzard", "Thank you, Mark.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Good morning.", "Jim Buzzard", "Hello, Mark.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "First question I had, can you just help us understand kind of the impact with resin prices falling and now it looks like resin prices rising. It seems like maybe Calmar and then that media business might be the places that would have the greatest impact?", "Jim Buzzard", "Good morning, Mark. Yes, those will be the two businesses. We have, following some of the rapid rises of 2008 and have worked to develop contracts that allow us to recover moves in resin prices. Sometimes we may lag a month or two but clearly as prices move, we are out in the marketplace moving prices to make that recovery.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Jim, by that should we assume that over the next couple of quarters here, if resin prices are rebounding, it shouldn't create a lot of incremental headwind for you?", "Jim Buzzard", "I think that's right. Yes.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Second question, the CNK business, it looks like market only ran at above 75% in the fourth quarter. Can you just \u2013 is that in fact right and can you talk about that a little bit?", "Jim Buzzard", "Sure. That \u2013 in-directionally, that's right. A couple things going on, as I mentioned in my comments, we had some customers who were pushing beverage orders out so that they could manage their inventories at year end. We elected to move up a maintenance outage that was scheduled for February of this year into December. And clearly, we were across all of our mills, working very hard on general inventories and collectively our paperwork mills we dropped inventories about 30,000 tons year-over-year.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. So that operating rate should start to return in the first quarter?", "Jim Buzzard", "That's correct. As I may have mentioned, we're seeing across the board our backlogs up about a week to a week and-a-half ahead of where they were this time last year and starting to approach more normal levels to this time of year.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then, finally, I wanted to turn back down to Brazil and I really had three small questions on that. First, are you continuing to acquire land down there?", "Jim Buzzard", "No. We didn't make any significant acquisitions on land in 2009 and don't have anything on the table at this point.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Second question around the land is up here it seems like you're moving away from forestry ownership. And I note that the most are starting to move down into Latin America. You guys have a great forestry business down there. Is that a business you want to hold onto or would you potentially look at freeing up some of the value in the forestry business in Brazil?", "Jim Buzzard", "As you reference, it has been a very good business for us down there. We have been able to take technologies that were developed in the United States. We have improved them down there around pine [ph] and so we've got this also very, very productive lands. We would want to make sure that whatever ownership structure we have that we can take advantage of that productivity because we believe we are competitively advantaged as a result of it.", "John Luke", "Yeah. I think from that standpoint, we have no near-term plans or considerations being given to an alternative structure. In fact, for all the reasons that Jim reinforced, we see opportunities for ever greater productivity and are aggressively pursuing that right now which gives us lots to think about as we look ahead in Brazil.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Is there any way, John, to actually leverage all of that know-how and expertise that you have over us \u2013 in a bigger fashion down there? I think those are some of the most productive forest lands in the world.", "John Luke", "I think you're absolutely right. We look at and in fact, we have sold seedlings overtime and that's been a nice source of income. There may be an opportunity for us to do more of that. And of course, some of the technology that we're employing down there is part of ArborGen that we and IP are partners in as well. You're onto something. It may not in the near term look to be a huge business, but there is opportunity to leverage that technology to our shareholders benefit.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then the last question is, it seems to me on the mill level down there that over the last three or four years, you have been doing a lot around the mill infrastructure that would eventually position you to say put a new machine in or really take a step up in the scale of the business down there. Can you just talk about the track you might be on there?", "John Luke", "I think it would be premature to go beyond that inquiry and speculation, Mark. But I think clearly as we looked and talked in the past, one would never rule out the consideration. That has been a great business for us for a long period of time and the future is wide and expansive. But all of the questions about infrastructure, fiber, whole series of things, not to mention the market planning and global economy would need to be much better aligned for us to offer a more definitive response than that. I think you're raising the right questions.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Just seems to me, John, it's a very globally competitive, good return region. It seems like that's an area where you ought to be deploying more capital.", "John Luke", "We appreciate that and we agree. And it is all in the planning and the right external environment for to us think about those kinds of things in a more determined fashion.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Fair enough.", "John Luke", "And appropriate line of question and we're with you.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "All right. Thanks.", "Operator", "Speakers, do we have time for one last question?", "Jason Thompson", "Yes. One last question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question will probably come from George Staphos with Banc of America.", "George Staphos \u2013 Banc of America/Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. Hi, guys. I will try to make it quick since we're late. I will ask them in sequence here. We talk about \u2013 you often talk about reducing capacity in your converting business. And a lot of the discussion tends to revolve around folding cartons and media. But do you have anything left and if you will the old Calmar businesses that are in need of being maybe further right sized, older technologies, et cetera, that we should expect in the next couple of years?", "Secondly, performance based comp. Like a lot of companies, it was a headwind in the fourth quarter. What should we pencil in for 2010, in terms of incremental expense relative to 2009?", "Then lastly, I am just having a little bit of difficulty. On the one hand, CNK volumes were down because of trends in beverage. Yet I thought you said, overall your beverage business and customers were flat to up, depending on the region. So trying to reconcile that with the de-stocking they were doing. Thanks. Good luck in the quarter.", "Jim Buzzard", "Mark and I will tag team on this one. In terms of Calmar and reducing capacity, as we reported in previous calls, we did a lot of work this year in terms of improving our supply chain there, both closing facilities and also bringing on additional manufacturing capacity in low cost country regions, as well as some outsourcing that we have been doing.", "George Staphos \u2013 Banc of America/Merrill Lynch", "Right.", "Jim Buzzard", "So we will feel very good about that platform as it exists today, but it is \u2013 in all of our businesses, we'll continue to keep a real tight watch on it and make sure that we are the most efficient cost effective that we can be. Mark, maybe turn to you on the performance-based comp question.", "Mark Rajkowski", "Yeah. Our performance-based comp was higher this year as we exceeded our targets. We had a very strong year. As we look at 2010, while we always hope to exceed targets and expectations, realistically we put stretch into our plans. As a result, the performance based comp next year we expect that to be substantially lower.", "Jim Buzzard", "Then lastly, George, in terms of the beverage markets, our European beer business continues to be down year-over-year. For our customers, both in the carbonated soft drinks as I referenced, up a little bit, beer markets North America down a little bit. For our consumers, it is flat to maybe down in Europe. For us, however, some of them did delay taking orders at year end to manage their inventories and so that just flowed back to the system.", "George Staphos \u2013 Banc of America/Merrill Lynch", "Mark, back to comp, you said substantially down. Is that a $10 million benefit, $5 million benefit, best you can approximate?", "Mark Rajkowski", "No. It would be multiple times.", "George Staphos \u2013 Banc of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. All right, guys, thanks again.", "Jim Buzzard", "Thank you, George.", "Operator", "And at this time, Mr. Thompson, do you have any closing remarks?", "Jason Thompson", "Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. The replay information is contained in our press release. We will speak with you next quarter. Take care.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude our conference for today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the call over to host, Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Jason Thompson. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jason Thompson", "Thanks Kelly and good morning, everyone. This morning we announced our results before the market opened. The notification of this morning's call was broadly disclosed. Further, this morning's call is being web cast at mwv.com and slides that accompany this call are available there as well.", "I will briefly remind you that certain statements we make are forward-looking and are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties described in our public filings. Furthermore, contents contain time sensitive information that although correct today, may change with the passage of time.", "First, a brief recap of the results we reported this morning. For the first quarter, we\u2019ve reported net income of 24 million or $0.14 per share. This includes net favorable after tax items totaling 5 million or $0.03 per share. Now here to tell you more about our results for the first quarter are John Luke, Chairman and CEO, Jim Buzzard, our President, and Mark Rajkowski, CFO. I will now turn the call over to John.", "John Luke", "Thanks Jason and good morning. MWV had another solid performance in the first quarter. Our positive earnings performance outpaced not only last year\u2019s first quarter but also the same pre-recession period in 2008 and 2007. It represents a fourth consecutive quarter of earnings growth directly attributable to our market participation and business model improvement strategies demonstrating that we are on the right track and are continuing to create a fundamentally more profitable company capable of generating consistent higher returns for shareholders. ", "It is these areas of strategic focus that will position us for greater profitability in the near term, well in advance of any full economics recoveries. With these strategies and some modest improvement and demand in the first quarter we increased volume compared to last year including both share gains and increased orders in many of our targeted markets. We increased sales for our higher value solutions for personal care, health care and home and garden packaging and we captured share gains with paper board in the food service tobacco and commercial print markets. We are also making significant gains in many of our specialty chemicals and consumer and office products markets. And Jim will provide more details in just a moment about these and other highlights across the company.", "With the operating leverage we\u2019ve created over the past year, having eliminated more than $185 million of structural cost, this improvement in volume had a beneficial impact on earnings performance during the quarter. The progress we have driven is gratifying and the underlying signs of market improvement compared to a year ago are welcome. That said, general market demand still remains well below peak 2007 levels and it remains uncertain whether the present improvement trend is durable or just temporary. While we hope that the current trajectory continues, we are continuing to plan for sustained softness. In either of that, we will continue to execute the strategy that has helped us deliver successful results throughout this challenging economic environment. ", "Specifically, we will continue to shape and execute our market participation strategies to ensure that we are driving our own destiny, creating opportunities for profitable growth with innovative products like MWare, Promina and Shell pack with investment in enhanced strategies in emerging markets like Brazil and China and with continued emphasis on overhead cost reductions and manufacturing productivity.", "With still limited visibility into what economic and market conditions maybe in the second half of this year, these areas of emphasis will continue to be the biggest contributors to our success. Across MWV today, we have significant positive momentum and are moving forward with pace and purpose. We\u2019re more profitable due to our discipline strategies to improve our revenue mix, exit low return business and close on profitable facilities. We are more competitive in targeted markets having launched innovative new products and expanded in the right geographies. We are more efficient and effective having reduced cost, significantly improve manufacturing productivity and augmented our organization with new talent and capabilities. ", "And our financial strength is both sound and continues to build. We remain on the right path to make MWV a fundamentally more profitable company and a more valuable investment, both in today\u2019s still soft and uncertain economy and in more prosperous times ahead.", "I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Jim Buzzard to talk about our business results in the first quarter before Mark discusses our financial metrics and provides more detailed outlook for the second quarter. Jim?", "Jim Buzzard", "Thanks John. This was one of our strongest quarters to start the year in recent memory as we often report a small loss in the seasonally slow period. Compared to the first quarter last year, we\u2019ve extended our positive earnings momentum with a significantly improved cost structure from ongoing actions, increased operating productivity to their facilities, share gains with targeted products and some increase in demand in key markets. These are things we\u2019ve been focused on each of businesses for more than a year and the impact continues to show in our overall results. During the quarter, we generated important commercial momentum for our participations strategies, gaining shares with targeted products and growing our positions in emerging markets. And for the first time since economic crisis began, demand trends turned upward in certain of our markets. I'll highlight some of the specific trends in each of our businesses in just a moment. ", "But overall, the result was a 5% increase in volume across the company. Along with the impact of our ongoing cost reduction and productivity actions, this top line growth helped derive adjusted EBIT up 97% for the first quarter. We edit more than $30 million of additional cost savings during the first quarter to the $154 million we completed to the end of 2009. With this leverage and a sequential growth trends we experienced in the first quarter, we believe our earning progress can continue in the second quarter and the positive impact should be even greater as demand grows. ", "Let me share some detail about the commercial trends and operating highlights in each of our businesses and consumer packaging markets. As always, you\u2019ll find additional information in the slide presentation that accompanies this call. In the packaging resources business, segment profitable is higher than last year as volume recovered and pricing gains and productivity actions at our mills drove an increase in earnings. ", "This came during the difficult quarter for our operations due to adverse weather conditions, unseasonably cold and wet weather reduced fiber availability across the industry which resulted in significantly higher input costs and lost productivity. Despite these challenges which head about a $25 million negative impact in our results, the segment earned $30 million during the quarter. This was almost 60% higher than last year and nearly as much as the first quarter of 2008.", "Compared to the first quarter of last year, shipments of SBS were up 3%. We outperformed the broader market in key segments including commercial prints, tobacco and food service grades. Our Mware line of paper board for recyclable and compostable food service applications such as cups and plates has been particularly strong. CNK\u2019s volumes were up 5% compared to last year as demand began to recover for both beverage and food packaging around the world and as we continue to make gains with recently added food customers.", "Volumes are also up in Brazil as the economy there has shown a solid recovery. As a result, Rigesa generated a strong profit growth with higher sales and improved productivity. Overall paperboard demands and packaging resources remain strong as we began the second quarter with backlogs currently between five and six weeks. The consumer solution segment had another strong quarter, its fifth straight period of year-over-year earnings growth.", "Profits rose to $21 million during the quarter, more than a 50% increase compared to last year due to productivity improvements, a stronger mix of high return products and gains in targeted packaging markets. The actions we took to eliminate some low return business from our portfolio brought overall sales down slightly compared to last year.", "Let me go through each of the consumer packaging markets we serve in this business to give you a sense of the performance in the quarter. In our global beverage business, sales and earnings were modestly lower with an unfavorable impact related to further realignments of our manufacturing footprint in Western Europe and North America. As these initiatives come to a close, we expect to see added productivity benefits as we move through 2010. Lower beverage volumes in the first quarter were primarily due to unseasonably cool weather in North America in January and February. We partially offset this impact with double digit growth in the Asia Pacific region led by our major customers by increased volumes in Australia and New Zealand. More recent sales to Rigesa improved notably. ", "Seasonally stronger volumes are running above a year ago levels at major beer and carbonated soft drink customers in the United States and Europe, part of what we are seeing is pipeline billing from very low year ago levels. We are also seeing more regular and larger orders suggesting some demand stabilization for the near term. We also continue to see good volume trajectory in Asia with major customers and will begin the benefit from new winds with yoghurt customers in China. This is an area we\u2019ve recently targeted for portfolio growth and are expecting increasing contributions to our business as we move through the year. In our health care business, earnings increased during the first quarter primarily because of the choices we\u2019ve made to emphasize Shell pack and other herein solutions and from strong productivity improvement. ", "In the first quarter last year, we produced about 13 million units for Wal-Mart\u2019s prescription drug program. This year that number is up to almost 25 million. They are currently 12 drugs being sold in shell pack at Wal-Mart\u2019s pharmacy counters and we expect that to grow this year as well. Sales are also steady for our oral and nasal pumps in the health care market with growth in the over the counter market as well as our for our specialty preservative free pumps that address a specific regulatory need in Europe.", "The personal care markets continue to improve and as a result, our business increase sales and earnings substantially configure particularly week first quarter last year when our customers aggressively de-stocked inventory. Our customers are now sounding more confident and that has translated into stronger orders for higher value fragrance dispensers, skincare airless products and luxury secondary packaging in Europe. We are gaining share in each of these categories by adding new customers as well as by adding to our business with existing customers line P&G, Unilever, L\u2019Oreal and J&J. With these improving demand trends we expect to continue our positive trajectory through the current quarter as this market rebound from historic lows last year.", "Volumes are good for our targeted products in the home and garden market primarily in United States especially the more profitable custom applicators for a long and garden maintenance and trigger sprayers for surface cleansers. The important spring garden season is off to a strong start with retailers reporting increased traffic and good sell through to the higher promotional activity by the branded industry leaders. And we are seeing solid growth for our next generation aerosol trigger with a new and existing customers.", "Overall, sales and earnings were down slightly despite this market progress in home and garden. As we get eliminated some of our offerings to focus on profitable products and were impacted by higher resin costs that we expect to recoup through contractual pass through over the next quarter or two.", "In the media business, sales earnings were lower than last year, we are managing to generate as much cash we possibly can from this business and doing so successfully by continue to drive productivity improvements and aggressively targeting categories and customers that are still profitable.", "Turning to our non packaging businesses, our positive earnings momentum continued in the first quarter for both consumer office products and specialty chemicals segments. The consumer office product segments had one of its best first quarter performances, earning $6 million in a quarter that traditionally loses money as we build through the North American back to school season later in the year. Sales of time management and other consumer products were hired to a retail and commercial partners and good so through for school supplies in Brazil where led the stronger replenishment order linked to in the first quarter. Sales in the quarter were up 7% and it could benefits from last year\u2019s acquisition of Grapohs. ", "Productivity across all this segments business especially in the United States coupled with a stronger volumes led the solid year-over-over earnings improvement. Sales increased significantly in a specialty chemical segment compared to a very weak quarter last year. And the business posted strong earnings of $25 million for the first quarter. This segment saw volumes recover strongly across key product lines in both pine chemicals and activated carbon.", "We had strong performances in adhesives and oil field services continue to grow the asphalt additives business especially in China and Brazil. And so our rebound and carbon volume due to an increase in auto production in North America. These volumes increase help to improve asset utilization rates and along with that, overall segment earnings. The  community development and land management segment earned $23 million in the first quarter including $17 million from 21 real estate transactions that closed during the first three months of the year. And with volume and pricing entire for pulp wood and saw timber, during the quarter, our four tree operations earned an additional $6 million. ", "While conditions in the real estate sector are still very difficult, we had some positive trends for both our rural land tracks and industrial and development sites. We completed a number of rural land transactions in the Charleston and South Carolina area and this mix of properties contributed to a higher per acre value during the quarter of about $4300.", "In addition, to an uptake in the number of sales during the quarter, the volume and quality of enquiries for these rural tracks was higher on a retail land website. And having recently unveiled the master plan for East Edisto, we are in negotiation with two potentials tenants for the commerce park that is part of the first phase of development.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss some of our financial metrics for the first quarter.", "Mark Rajkowski", "Thank Jim. The momentum on our market participation in business model strategies that john and Jim are helping us a fundamentally more profitable company that we believe can continue to generate sustainable performance improvement over the long term. In the first quarter, our progress was clearly reflected in many of our financial metrics including the following highlights.", "Overall sales grew 4% with volume increases driven by our new products, share gains in targeted markets and continued strong growth in emerging markets. Our operating profit essentially doubled due to the combination of our improved cost structure and successful growth strategies. And we have a strong balance sheet with the total debt to capital ratio below 40% and substantial cash reserves that enable us to continue to profitably grow our business and provide strong returns to our shareholders.", "Let me provide a bit more detail on each of these measures of our progress during the first quarter. On the top-line, our over sales growth was 4%. Excluding the large land sale last year and product line exits related to our market participation strategies, comparable first quarter sales increased to approximately 10% consisting of about 5% of volume improvement and 5% of FX benefits and other items. Our overall volume benefited modestly from the demand improvement we experienced in the quarter well more than half the increase came from the success we are seeing with our growth strategies. ", "New products in the quarter accounted for over 16% of total first quarter revenue including a strong rebound in demand for recently launched fragrance and airless dispensing products as well as continued strength in our shell pack product for prescription drugs. We also saw share gains in higher value paper board grades like commercial print and in our specialty chemicals markets. In the 22% sales increase from emerging markets we saw in the quarter was driven by recovering volumes in Brazil and continued strong growth for beverage packaging and asphalt additives in China. ", "Increased sales in the continued benefit of our productivity and overhead cost actions resulted in year-over-year improvement of 250 basis points in our operating profit. First quarter adjusted earnings before interest and taxes almost doubled versus last year to $73 million. Our strong performance is being driven by the ongoing execution of strategies to fundamentally improve the company\u2019s underlying profitability. Importantly we expect to further leverage our improved cost base and expand margins as we continue to profitability grow our business. ", "Taking a closer look at the key performance drivers, both adjusted gross margin and SG&A saw continued solid year-over-year improvement.", "First quarter adjusted gross margin improved by almost 100 basis points versus the first quarter of 2009 to 17.5%. This includes absorbing approximately 190 basis points of negative weather related impacts at the mills during the quarter. Adjusted SG&A decreased 9% on an absolute basis versus the prior year and was 12.5% of sales, an improvement of a 170 basis points versus the year ago quarter.", "Moving to the balance sheet, our financial position and flexibility remain excellent. At the end of the quarter, total cash was $731 million. Our net debt to capital ratio was 30% and our pension plan was more than 140% funded. Cash flow used by operations was approximately $8 million in the quarter. Significant cash earnings in a 2.5 day improvement in our cash-to-cash cycle were more than offset by incentive compensation payments.", "As we move through the year, we expect cash flow from operations to significantly improve. And for the full year, we expect to achieve another year of positive free cash flow which we define as cash flow from operations after CapEx and dividends. With respect to deploying our cash recourses, we will continue to remain our balanced approach. Over the past three years, we\u2019ve generated about $3 billion of discretionary cash flow from operation and assets sales. Over this period, we have reinvested about a third of this cash back into the business. We\u2019ve returned about a third to shareholders through a strong dividend and periodic share re-purchases and we have used the third to repay debt and build up our cash resources during the economic crisis. ", "These priorities remain the same as we move forward. Now turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We saw improving demand trends during the first quarter and given current order rates and back logs, we expect these trends to continue through the second quarter. Beyond that however, there is less certainty as order pattern into the second half of the year will depend on retail, sell through levels which are subject to risks related to continued high levels of unemployment and shifts in consumer confidents. That said, we are continuing to position all businesses to capture growth and bring more of it to the bottom line. ", "Our commercial strategies are working, we have good confidence in our more competitive business model and we are continuing to selectively re-invest in profitable growth opportunities across our businesses. We will however be watching commodity inflation which we expect will pick up through the year and could accelerate if demand trends mover higher than the current trajectory. But we will off course continue to seek pricing to offset these impacts. With that as context, I'll now provide some segment specific comments for the second quarter, starting with package and resources. We\u2019re expecting segment profit to be solidly above last year. ", "", "Backlogs at the mills are currently running well above year ago levels and the combination of better demand with an improved product mix and higher productivity levels are the main drivers of our positive outlook. In addition, we expect continued profit growth at Rigesa. Rising input cost will partially offset these positive factors in the near term including lingering fiber inflation trends from the weather related issues in the first quarter as well as inflation for some commodity chemicals in outbound freight.", "We are however continuing to implement pricing actions to offset the negative impacts from cost inflation. In the consumer solutions group, segment profit is expected to be solidly above year-ago levels. Improved results will be driven by continue demand recovery through the current quarter for targeted products across our personal care, homing garden and health care packaging businesses as well as seasonal strength in beverage which we started to see in March. We also expect to see higher pricing to recapture resin inflation as well as continued productivity gains.", "Turning to the consumer and office product segment, we are expecting another solid overall back to school season. We are however expecting profit to be modestly lower than last years very strong second quarter performance while the business will continue to benefit from strong productivity gains and cost reductions as is the case with this business, the timing of selling and the ultimate sell through to the consumer of the segment\u2019s back-to-school products can significantly impact the level of revenues and profits during the quarter.", "In specialty chemicals, we expect another strong quarter with significant year-over-year improvement. Benefits from continued demand recovery across pine chemical can activate carbon markets and higher productivity levels are expected to drive substantially improved earnings. However, inflation in certain raw material and freight costs will partially offset these positive factors in the near term. Finally in the community development and land management segment, the timing of land sales which is the key near term driver of results remains difficult to forecast. However, we do expect modestly improved segment profit versus the year ago quarter.", "The level of improvement will continue to depend on the amount, timing and mix of the land we sell in the quarter. In summary, during the second quarter, we expect to extend our record solid year-over-year earnings growth and margin improvement. While demand trends are improving its important to keep in mind that in most cases, our volumes are still well off peak 2007 levels. The improvements were driving are largely the result of continued execution of our strategies to improve our business model. With that, I will turn it back over to John.", "John Luke", "Thanks Mark. In summary, the first quarter was another strong one for MWV with continued momentum from our market participation and business model improvement strategies. We are benefiting from progress we\u2019ve driven in our targeted markets as well some early stage general market improvement. And we will remain on the path that we\u2019ve established for long term profitable growth continuously refining our participation in the most attractive markets and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our business model. The impact is already apparent in our improved earning results and we are committed to continuing to deliver higher profitability and additional value to our shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning and we now be happy address your questions.", "Question-And-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operators Instruction) Our first question comes from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "George Staphos - Bank of America", "Thanks, guys. Hi, good morning. Thanks for all the details too on the outlook and on the land business and for that matter congratulations to you on the lower corporate. I guess a couple questions may be on the outlook just to finish up. It sounds like and we heard some comments yesterday from another company that back-to-school season this year as opposed to last year will be more third quarter than second quarter weighted, given what you can know right now and I realize there's variability on this. Is that what you're saying as well?", "John Luke", "Jim, you want to start with that?", "Jim Buzzard", "Sure. George, I think that\u2019s exactly what we are saying. For the last several years have continued to see that season get later and later and driven apart by some of the supply chain efficiencies that all those can bring. So, we believe that trend will continue this year as well and so we may see more of it moving to the third quarter.", "George Staphos - Bank of America", "Okay. And question for you Mark or John? At the end of the release, you say that we should see improved year-over-year performance in the second quarter of 2010. Should we translate that as a better year-on-year increase than what we saw in the first quarter from an earnings per share standpoint?", "Mark Rajkowski", "George, its Mark. We have a bigger base of income in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. So the comparisons are a little difficult. It\u2019s like apples and oranges. But I, so that the percentage won't be quite as large but we feel very good our year-over-year performance trends for the second quarter.", "George Staphos - Bank of America", "", "I wasn\u2019t talking percentage of those, just trying to quit at earnings per share but and see if you\u2019re trying to actually communicate that in line. I'll leave it there for now. I guess two last questions and I'll turn over. And I didn\u2019t calculate this, what were you offering rates in bleached and numerator a of place of where you are growing? Were you seeing the best trend right now in terms of the pick up and bleached demand?", "Jim Buzzard", "", "George, this is Jim. Our operating rates continue to decline. We actually because of all the issue that we had around weather and having to slow back because correctly lack of fiber ran reasonably full through out the entire first quarter. ", "", "George Staphos - Bank of America", "", "How are you right now?", "Jim Buzzard", "", "We are, we\u2019re solid right now and back logs as I said are five to six weeks and those have actually grown over the last month.", "George Staphos - Bank of America", "", "Your operating rate would be in low 90\u2019s, mid 90\u2019s high 80\u2019s?", "Jim Buzzard", "", "What were in the low 90\u2019s?", "George Staphos - Bank of America", "", "Okay. And last question, you had given we saw a pick up in CNK board. Should we then expect a pick up in beverage packaging and in turn, where are you seeing the pickup if from a geographic stand point? Are you seeing an improvement and may be you mentioned it before I missed it in your near trends in North America? Thanks very much.", "Jim Buzzard", "", "No George, your conclusion is right. With the pick up in CNK, you can expect to see growth in the beverage markets, I also would note that part of the pickup in CNK is our real effort to begin to grow in non-beverage markets as well so in food and another general packaging applications. But we are anticipating growth in the second quarter in both North America and Asia-Pacific in the beverage markets.", "Operator", "Thank you. And next we will go to the line of Claudia Hueston with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Claudia Hueston - JP Morgan", "Hi. Thanks very much, good morning. ", "Jim Buzzard", "", "Morning Claudia. ", "Claudia Hueston - JP Morgan", "You've announced you're doing some feasibility work in Brazil. I was just hoping you could talk a little about the evaluation process there. And then maybe just talk about how you see container board demand developing in that region and any extra color you could give on Rigesa?", "John Luke", "Why don\u2019t I start as John? We are conducting a wide range of analysis in Brazil because of the strength Brazil represents to us. As you know we have been there for almost 60 years and that\u2019s been a solid growing and very profitable business for us. At the present time as we announced among other things, we are evaluating the potential to add capacity to our mill in Tres\u00a0Barras that would all be designed to have more adequately and efficiently utilize infrastructure that we largely have in place and in the process, reintegrate our corrugated business which is growing nicely in the local market. The market strength there over the past few years has been particularly good and with the strength that Brazil almost uniquely has in the world today, we are seeing good growth particularly for the profitable differentiated products that we produce now and projected over time. ", "So we are looking hard at what the future opportunities for us in Brazil can and should be both strategically and opportunistically but at the core of that right now is the evaluation of the capacity addition at the Tres\u00a0Barras mill. We are in the early stages of that while the work is very, very good. We are on schedule to hopefully meet the target that we have broadly set for completing this analysis at the end of this calendar year.", "Claudia Hueston - JP Morgan", "Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. I appreciate that. And then just looking, it looks like you bought back some stock in the quarter, can you update me on what\u2019s left under your authorization and how you are prioritizing buy backs with capital investments like the one potentially in Brazil with dividends and acquisitions as well.", "Mark Rajkowski", "Sure Claudia, this is Mark. We repurchased about $26 million worth of stock in the quarter that was about 1.1 million shares. We have approximately 1 million shares that remain under that current authorization. And as we look at deploying cash, I think we were going to continue to remain balanced. We are going to continue to remain disciplined. I think that approach has served us well and we do see opportunities to profitability grow our business. You referenced Brazil on that. That is one example.", "Claudia Hueston - JP Morgan", "And when you think about your, you\u2019ve targeted debt levels are you pretty much where you want to be or do you hope to sort of de-lever more or are you feel your under levered?", "Mark Rajkowski", "We are slightly under 40% debt-to-cap and we are pretty comfortable with that amount of leverage. And as you know, looking at a maturity schedule, we don\u2019t have any significant maturities due for the next two or three years. So, we are in a pretty good spot right now.", "Claudia Hueston - JP Morgan", "Okay. Great, thank you so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And next we\u2019ll go to the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Hi, good morning.", "John Luke", "", "Good morning Gail", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "I just wanted to get some color that $25 million operating hit in the packaging resource that included actual operations but also input costs associated with the weather?", "Jim Buzzard", "Gail, this is Jim. That\u2019s right. It\u2019s really a function of several things. One is simply higher input costs where we are heading to reach much further out to get wood. We had several situations were based on the lack of wood, we actually had to slow back operations. And then lastly, with the lack of wood, coping less, you have less internal generated energy from black liquor. So we had to go on and use more fossil fuels to run the operations. The combination of those three elements represented about $25 million in cost to us in the quarter.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Okay. And it's fair to say the majority of that would disappear in the second quarter with the weather improved or was the kind of wood cost the highest, the biggest component of that?", "Jim Buzzard", "What have you seen and what we are forecasting, I would say about half of that will disappear but we are staring at probably $12 to $13 million, it is with what we see today for the quarter.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Okay, that\u2019s perfect. Thank you. Also, just wanted to get some more color on your demand outlook. I appreciate the second half is still a while away but your caution is that just truly based on macro or is there anything you're seeing from your customer order patterns or you're hearing from your customers or seeing in your inventories that makes you particularly cautious about the second half of demand outlook?", "John Luke", "Gail, I\u2019ll take that up. It\u2019s John. I think across the board, it really is the fact that our customers are telling when that their visibility is limited. I don\u2019t think there are any factors that we\u2019re seeing in our markets that are creating concerns for our customers for indeed for us. Its just that with the macro factors that we\u2019re all facing, visibility remains limited and we\u2019ll probably have to clear it, make sure as we move March but through the middle of May and into the end of May and see what July and there after begins to look like. So it\u2019s just, I think there\u2019s just a good deal of caution and tread lightly added to across all of our markets.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "", "Okay. Do you have read into what this and doing within inventories? I mean there\u2019s still keeping those quite lean or at this point, with the demand that you\u2019ve seen today, do you think some of that same inventory re-stocking?", "John Luke", "", "What I'm seeing and I'll ask Jim to comment more on what I'm hearing is that inventories have been managed reasonably tightly and leanly that there is no major restocking efforts. So the sales that we\u2019re generating or represent real underlying demand. ", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "", "Okay. And Jim in, can timber solution, I just want to confirm that you were pretty confident last quarter talking about the past through and being much more secure than I guess in 2008, is that still the case? Has anything changed given the inflation we\u2019ve seen this year?", "Jim Buzzard", "", "Yeah, I'm sure there\u2019s a little bit of, I missed a part. Was that resin costs?", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "", "Is the past using consumer solutions? ", "", "Jim Buzzard", "", "Okay. We clearly through the quarter and into the second quarter are seeing significant increases in our resin costs. And so that\u2019s impacting our inflation picture. A large majority of that business does have contractual pass throughs but they are delaying either a quarter or two. So the increases that we saw in Q1, we will begin, we will begin to recover those in Q2. Having said that, we have seen some increases in Q2 that will begin to recover in Q3 as well.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS", "Okay. But are you still comfortable that you're better positioned to cope with that than you were back in 2008?", "Jim Buzzard", "I'm sorry. Absolutely. We\u2019ve done a lot of work over the course of the last 12 to 18 months to restructure our customer contracts and protect ourselves. And we already much better position to move in 2008.", "Operator", "Thank you. And next we go to the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning. I wondered if we could talk a little above the SBS market right now. There were some price increases that were realized in the trade papers this weekend and I just wonder how that rolls through for you guys across your bleached board portfolio in the second quarter and beyond?", "Mark Rajkowski", "Jim, you want to take that up? ", "Jim Buzzard", "Sure Mark. If you note on our slides, our pricing moved up about $30 a ton in Q1 with year-over-year. As you know, we are moving pricing at the end of this month and aren\u2019t actively doing that right now. We have confidence that prices will begin, we will move even further as a result of these announcements. But at this point, it\u2019s still early in the process so I would want to predict what that\u2019s going to be.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "There's enough of your business if I recall Jim that's on longer-term contracts that we really wouldn't want to take that $40 and just slap that onto our second quarter realization. Is that correct?", "Jim Buzzard", "That\u2019s correct and most of that business all moved in the first quarter and so you wouldn\u2019t apply all that across the board for sure.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "And also in the SBS market, it sounds like some of the other players are reporting long backlogs and very tight supplies. I just wondered, whether there's any potential for you, if the market remains tight to bring up any of the idle machines either at Evadale or Covington.", "Jim Buzzard", "No. There\u2019s no potential we would do that.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "And then turning to Brazil just to kind of follow on, I know that you trying to kind of leverage some of the capital that you spend around the mill down there over the last several years. Just to take advantage of that without adding anymore beyond a machine, what kind of scale would that put us on.", "Jim Buzzard", "We have already designed exactly what the machine is going to do Mark. We will not, we will not add significant infrastructure capital. We will have to do a little bit down there but to your point whether it\u2019s around power generation, the pot mill, we are pretty well set. And so we will design the machine to take full advantage of that but not spend significant capital beyond what we\u2019ve already done on the back end infrastructure.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Like how much Jim, how much extra hoping capacity is there at the mill right now?", "Jim Buzzard", "Mark, we would, we could design probably somewhere around the 300,000 ton machine. It all depends on basis weights and other things that we could support that with the pulping capacity we have today, some OCC and other things. And that initial box what we are thinking about.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "And are you also down there Jim? Are you investing in Brazil or beyond in the corrugated business? This market is growing.", "Jim Buzzard", "It is and that\u2019s clearly something we are looking at. We\u2019ve been growing with that markets, we\u2019ve put a new box plant up in the northeast a couple of years ago. We really like the integrated model we have down there from forestry through the corrugated boxes. And so as part of this, we certainly will be evaluating how and where we might grow the corrugated business as well.", "John Luke", "Yeah and I will just jump on there Mark and say as you know in only South America as well as you do that Brazil is we are seeing good consumer growth and we are seeing with all the foreign investment going in good industrial growth and all of that is translating to a very strong outlook for continued growth in the corrugated market.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Yeah if you just look at what's happening in other packaging markets down there really is pretty dramatic. Last question I have. Charleston, are you guys feeling any impact yet from the announcement by Boeing to move Dreamliner production down there? Is that bringing in sort of other suppliers for secondary and tertiary suppliers that might be interested in spreading on some of your property?", "John Luke", "I think the broad answer to that question Mark is yes. I think the work that it was underway to encourage the Boeing expansion as well as broad based work by the South Carolina ports, not to mention other good economic development look down there. As in what is across the country been a very weak real estate market and I would underscore the Charleston area is not immune. But the Charleston area has benefited by all of these actions and directly or indirectly, we felt little bit of lift in the time.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. All right. Any sense John on when will is analysts and investors be able to like perhaps look at what you're doing down there? Get a little more color on that?", "John Luke", "Great question and I think the story is developing very nicely and we would look for the opportunity to provide that opportunity. I won\u2019t want to pick a date right now but thanks for the prompt and will take that into our plans.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to the line of Mark Weintraub of Buckingham Research.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Thank you. First is a small question on the tax rate. Mark, what should we be thinking for the balance of the year?", "Mark Rajkowski", "", "We\u2019re looking at the 25 to 27% effective tax rate Mark. ", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "", "And then, I was hoping, can we get a little bit more break down on the 82 million on productivity gains that you showed year-over-year, is there a way that to categories them and also, how much is yet to come from actions that you\u2019ve already taken?", "Jim Buzzard", "", "Mark, maybe I'll take that. Really within late 2008, we started on a four prong approach to go after productivity. And as you know, we made a significant effort to drive our overhead structure and reduce fix cost. We worked very hard on a sourcing initiative to drive down input costs. We consolidated or closed 16 facilities around the globe to get our infrastructure where we needed it to be. And we\u2019ve had a very strong operating excellence program out a mill based businesses that we\u2019ve taken and driven that through all this is now and beginning to take it around the globe. So all elements of that were components of what helped drive the performance in Q1. You can think about it that it probably 30 million of the 82 was flow though from last year and the remaining 50 or so are actions that we\u2019ve taken this year and we\u2019ll continue to build on this program as we go throughout the rest of this year. ", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "", "And so from actions that you have taken recently, how much would you say is, how much would you be targeting to improve relative to what we already saw in first quarter? I think that's a fair way to look at it?", "Mark Rajkowski", "Well let me take that, the piece of it that relates to the actions that we took last year related to overhead and capacity rationalization. As last year we delivered over a $150 million of bottom line cost reduction. As Jim said in the first quarter this year, we saw a more than $30 million of additional cost take out related to those programs. And as we said last year, we continue to expect the full run rate benefit of those programs to beat the $250 million cost reduction. So we are a $185 million into that 250.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Okay. And how did you get that 185? So I can't just take the $82 in times by four and be it at $320 million?", "Mark Rajkowski", "No Mark because as Jim was saying in that $80 million, you have a combination of sources of productivity. You have productivity driven from cost actions related to overhead, manufacturing capacity rationalization as well as tremendous amount of work that Jim and the team are doing around, driving sourcing benefits and operating productivity in the plans.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Okay. So the 250 is just some of that? Okay, I think I understand.", "Mark Rajkowski", "The 250 gets back to the program that we start at last year around overhead reduction and manufacturing capacity rationalization.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Okay. And then just a add-on too much on the net but if the weather is better and at first quarter $25 million hit was a function of bad weather, I'm not quite sure why you don't get the full $25 million back in the second quarter.", "Jim Buzzard", "A point of that was related to we still have some tough weather in April especially down in Evadale, Texas. We\u2019re having to rebuild inventory with more expensive wood just to get back to where we can continue to operate. So that\u2019s about what the impact is going to be and we feel pretty confident.", "John Luke", "Yeah. I think fundamentally the way I look at it Mark is you\u2019ve got little bit weather hang over and you\u2019ve got some catch up that\u2019s required just to get things back to normal.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "Okay. And then by the third quarter, you so basically you\u2019ve got half of it back in the second quarter in the balance and the third quarter assuming the weather behaves itself. ", "John Luke", "Right.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next we go to the line of Mark Connelly of CLFA.", "Mark Connelly - CLSA", "I just have two questions. When I look at your consumer solutions business and the gives and takes this quarter, clearly some of the businesses you\u2019ve invested in more recently that are hopefully higher growth and certainly higher margin are kicking in and you are throwing out some of the lower stuff, should we expect that to sort of be an ongoing cleansing process where the top line isn\u2019t growing as much as the margins are or are you going to take more discreet steps to rebalance that portfolio towards the higher end.", "John Luke", "Let me start with that and Jim and Mark can chime in Mark. I think that there will always be a weeding out process as markets change and some become more attractive and others become less so. But I think as you look at this which I think is the essence of your question, you can look at it with the view that we\u2019ve taken a pretty aggressive approach over the course of the past twelve months. So the major weeding has been done and the focus now is on pursuing strategic initiatives in those areas we see as representing significant opportunity for profitable growth.", "Mark Connelly - CLSA", "That's very helpful. That's exactly what I was looking for. And my second question is, how with all the gains you've gotten in cost in productivity, how do you get comfortable that you're going to be able to hold on to all of that as business starts to come back in the pressure for reinvestment starts to kick back in?", "John Luke", "Again, let me offer a couple of comments here at a high level. That is all part of the new operating discipline that is we are committed to maintaining, We view growth investment, it is something that is going to be important to our future both to support the strategic agenda referred to in your first question and we are looking to fund that by continuing to ensure that we are disciplined in taking all our necessary cost out of the system while continuing to improve overall productivity.", "Of course, there will be investments in SG&A and product particularly related to market development activity and there will be capital requirements that we\u2019ve talked about at a high level earlier in this call. But we would look to ensure that the productivity benefit, the leanness that we are building into our system at all levels is looked to be maintained.", "Mark Rajkowski", "And then I\u2019d just add to that, I think while we are pleased with the progress that we have been able to make till date, we are certainly not satisfied. We see continued opportunities as John said to drive further productivity improvements and that really is what we are about. So, we see further opportunities for improving our cost structure.", "Mark Connelly - CLSA", "Mark, I assume you're going to hold him to that. Thanks very much. I appreciate your help.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Richard Skidmore at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "", "Good morning. I just had two questions really following up on a couple of others. First on a consumer solutions business, is there a step change coming in the margin that we should anticipate given the strategic you\u2019ve done and the productivity efforts that you\u2019ve made or is this kind of a long term mid single digit kind of margin business?", "John Luke", "", "We certainly will look to continue with the initiatives we have in improving our market positions, the areas that we\u2019ve targeted as wells as continuing to look to lean out the cost wherever we can to improve the margins but I wouldn\u2019t expect a huge step change but I would certainly look to see continuing improvement as we move forward. ", "Jim Buzzard", "", "Yeah John, I'd say that certainly that\u2019s our expectation through the course of this year. And the other part of this is what John and Jim were talking about before which is really capitalizing on the investments we have made in innovation and in the commercial side to bring new profitable products to the market place. So this is not just a cross play. And we do have more room in terms of margin expansion on the cost side but we also expect to continue to grow profitability with new products and entering new markets. ", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "", " And then just maybe shifting to the financial side of the question, Mark is there any reason that the cash balance continuous to kind of hang at the kind of $500 million more than what you\u2019ve historically run at. And I know you talked about a disciplined approach to deploying capital and maintaining a balanced approach but is there any reason that you wouldn\u2019t be more aggressive in deploying that capital over the next twelve to eighteen months?", "Jim Buzzard", "", "Well, I think that as I said, we\u2019re going to be balanced and disciplined. And certainly, we are looking for opportunities to profitably grow our business and where we see those and one example as I mentioned before and we have talked about it certainly is Brazil. And we certainly will look to continue to provide a good strong return to our shareholder. So I think that there is nothing that\u2019s going to eminent that\u2019s going to suck up all that cash. We are going to continue to play it as we have and expect to be very balanced and disciplined in deploying that capital.", "John Luke", "And I will just add towards Mark by saying as we have emphasized this morning we are very encouraged by the progress we are making. We are encouraged by the opportunities for profitable growth we see in our market and particularly those that with our focus on those markets and the innovations and the initiatives we have underway across the board to create opportunities for us though despite what is happening in the broader macro environment. But again considering Mark\u2019s response which I think reflects where we are, visibility is limited and we access opportunities and we have greater visibility, we will be in a position to make more clearer decisions with respect to timing and use of resources that\u2019s logical to deploy.", "Operator", "Thank you. And we do have time for one more question that will come from Peter Ruschmeier of Barclays", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays", "Thanks, good morning and thank you very much for taking my questions. I thought the chemical results were terrific. I was hoping you could help us to better understand the trends there. 47% increase in revenues year-over-year, if we were to break that down by some of your sub segments, pine chemicals, activated carbon etc. can you help us to understand which were the main contributors?", "Jim Buzzard", "We really had strong improvement across the board. Last quarter, the last year\u2019s first quarter was really, really weak especially automotive side and some of the key pine chemical markets. So we saw a good solid growth across the board. Automotive carbon was up nicely and as is our absorption technology business but really the ink markets, the adhesive markets are new places we played everybody was up very, very nicely year on year.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays", "Okay. And the margins there look to be at or near the highest levels you\u2019ve seen at least the decade. I'm curious how much of that was simply the contribution margin from the volumes being better or is there something unusual about the price cost mix that\u2019s going on. In other words, should we be expecting a step change, a new higher level of margins or is it really the confluence of a number of things that led to an unusually high margin.", "John Luke", "I think if you go back and look at last year, we\u2019ve had a steady March and improved margins in this business and that continued through Q1. And so, I think that you can expect to see good strong margin potential going forward. Obviously, a big part of it is the capacity utilization where we were able to put a lot more volume through our existing facilities. We are able to take advantage of some of the focused investments we\u2019ve made over the last couple of years. So a lot of things came together to drive the improvement.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays", "Okay. And Jim do you care to share with us your thoughts on growth for this business and given what you are seeing in Asia, given some of the infrastructure spending in the U.S. road paving etc. what kind of range might you expect going forward for top line growth do you think is reasonable? Is it GDP, the GDP plus?", "Jim Buzzard", "I think on a go forward basis, you can expect to see this GDP plus sort of growth. I think the business is well positioned in the emerging markets into your point we are seeing really good growth in China and Brazil as they invest in infrastructure. So, I would say certainly GDP plus going forward.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Okay, that's helpful. You mentioned CNK picking up your outlook for this year in North America. How about in Europe given some of the weakness there, what is your outlook for the beverage packaging season looking out into Q2, Q3?", "Jim Buzzard", "Our focus is on the higher end of the beer markets over there and given the economic situation we think that still going to be a pretty tough market in throughout this year, some flattish sort of a perspective.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Okay. That's helpful. And last question I'll turn it over. In the SBS business, remind us if you could, roughly what percent of your volume or how many tons goes into a septic packaging and what are you seeing in that segment in terms of its competitive positioning versus other substrates? Are you seeing more growth opportunities there?", "Jim Buzzard", "Not going to break out the tonnage that we put into a separate but suffice to say we are seeing continued growth in that business, primarily out of the emerging markets and particularly China. So in applications for milk and other things, we are seeing positive momentum.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "And are the margins materially better in that business versus your normal mix just given the nature of the product?", "Jim Buzzard", "It\u2019s a good margin business for us and we are committed to making it better.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Very good. Guys, thanks very much and congratulations on the quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. And gentlemen, I'll turn it back to you for closing remarks.", "John Luke", "Thanks everyone for joining us. We look forward to following up with you. And Kelly, if you can give the replay information out, that\u2019d be great.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Rajkowski - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President", "James Buzzard - President", "John Luke - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Executive Committee", "Jason Thompson - Director of Investor Relations", "Analysts", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Claudia Hueston - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (NYSE:USA) Inc.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "George Staphos", "Chip Dillon - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the MWV Second Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Jason Thompson. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jason Thompson", "Thanks, Coleman, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced our results before the market opened. The notification in this morning's call was broadly disclosed. Further, this morning's call is being webcast at mwv.com, and slides that accompany this call are available there as well.", "I'll briefly remind you that certain statements we make are forward-looking and are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties described in our public filings. Furthermore, contents contain time-sensitive information that although correct today, may change with the passage of time. ", "First, a brief recap of the results we reported this morning. For the second quarter, we reported net income of $50 million or $0.29 per share, this includes after-tax restructuring charges of $11 million or $0.06 per share. Now here to tell you more about our results for the second quarter are John Luke, Chairman and CEO; Jim Buzzard, our President; and Mark Rajkowski, CFO. I'll now turn the call over to John.", "John Luke", "Thanks, Jason, and good morning. MWV's financial performance during the second quarter builds on the forward momentum we have established from our deliberate transformation strategies. In this most recent period, we recorded another quarter of strong improvement across key profitability metrics, gained share in targeted end markets in each of our businesses, generated double-digit growth in our largest and most important emerging markets, Brazil and China, and delivered strong flow-through of our hard-earned cost savings and productivity gains. The result was a near doubling of our operating profit, and we further strengthened our already sound financial position. ", "This performance demonstrates the strategies we are executing in each of our businesses to enhance our market participation and reduce cost are improving the fundamental profitability of our company. We continue to pursue these strategies with both diligence and confidence. We expect that they will enable MWV to continue to perform well in the present economy, will bolster relative performance should there be an economic downturn and will generate superior returns in a more robust economy.", "In a moment, Jim will provide you with greater detail on our strategy execution. Mark will follow with an in-depth look at the impact of our overall financial performance. First though, I wanted to further emphasize the focused set of strategies that now characterize MWV's more profitable business model. Each of our segments is providing demonstrable and differentiated value to our customers, delivering more profitability to the bottom line and pursuing profitable growth that we are able to invest in due to the solid financial foundation we have established and maintained throughout this difficult period. ", "In short, MWV today is a stronger company. Our transformation into a market-focused company is providing us sustainable competitive advantages with an enriched product mix, a growing pipeline of new products and strong positions in the most promising emerging markets. As examples, we have doubled the volume of our innovative airless dispensing products for beauty and personal care applications, a direct result of relationships we formed with our major consumer packaged goods customers to deliver solutions that are helping them win in both developed and rapidly growing emerging markets, such as China. ", "We also continue to expand Shellpak's position as a leading product in the healthcare market, as it has been scientifically proven to increase patient adherence to the schedule and dosage of their prescription medicine. We have produced meaningful growth and market share gains for our bleached paperboard, in many cases, earning business when brand owners specify the use of our paperboard for their highest-value products, just as they have in the food and tobacco markets. ", "Similarly, we have turned meaningful customer engagement efforts into growth for our MWare line of paperboard for products in the food service market. We are very encouraged by our continuing progress in Brazil, where Rigesa's differentiated product offerings and value-based selling continue to generate strong volume growth and returns for the company. As our investors are aware, we are evaluating the possibility of additional investments in Brazil that would further extend our advantages in that attractive and growing marketplace.", "And our Specialty Chemical business is continuing to exploit growing global demand for infrastructure and energy. The improved performance they demonstrate to customers with their proprietary additives is generating growth for asphalt solutions in the United States, China and other countries throughout Asia. ", "More innovative products like MWare paperboard, airless dispensers and Evotherm asphalt additive; deeper customer partnerships, such as those with food brand owners and large retailers competing in the market for generic prescriptions using adherence packaging; and intense focus on the right opportunities for growth in emerging markets where our business grew by 17% during the second quarter. When these examples and more are added to our relentless discipline for cost reduction and productivity improvements, our ongoing transformation is the key to the earnings improvement we have delivered.", "Our outlook for demand beyond the third quarter is uncertain, and our customers remain cautious about consumer spending and business investments. However, we expect to further improve our performance by executing the same strategy that has helped us deliver successful results throughout this challenging economic environment. Sharper, more focused market participation, improved cost structure and productivity and a stronger financial position to fuel profitable growth. This course will provide a sustainable advantage for MWV as we work to further increase the value we deliver to shareholders.", "I'll now turn the call over to Jim Buzzard to talk about our business results in the second quarter before Mark discusses our financial metrics and provides a more detailed outlook for the third quarter. Jim?", "James Buzzard", "Thanks, John. We executed our strategies very well during the second quarter and generated strong earnings results for each of our business segments and for the company as a whole. Across our businesses, we made gains in targeted markets and delivered further improvements as part of our strategic cost management program. The result is a more competitive set of businesses that are generating profitable growth for MWV and that are pursuing additional opportunities in the most attractive markets. ", "Overall sales were up 8% during the second quarter compared to last year, reflecting a determined focus to grow in our targeted global markets. We increased sales of higher value, differentiated products during the quarter and also saw some year-over-year improvement in our markets. With growing demand for MWV's richer portfolio of products and solutions, we also had substantial bottom-line contribution from price and mix during the quarter.", "We also are maintaining the intensity of our cost reduction program, achieving an additional $27 million of capacity and overhead cost savings during the quarter on top of another strong productivity performance across our operations.  With continued progress in these important areas during the second quarter, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and special items increased 81%. ", "Let me share details about the performance and trends in each of our businesses and consumer packaging markets. As always, you'll find additional information in the slide presentation that accompanies this call.", "In the Packaging Resources business, segment profit was up by 47%, with increased sales volumes of higher-value products and improvements in our manufacturing productivity, driving our earnings. We achieved this solid improvement despite some operating challenges, including significantly higher inflation driven by the lingering impact of severe weather on our fiber costs at the mills and freight cost increases. ", "Sales were up 10% during the quarter. Shipments of bleached paperboard and Coated Natural Kraft were each 3% higher than last year, continuing the trend of increases since the beginning of 2010. We achieved strong pricing and mix gains as we focused on our participation in the highest-value paperboard markets we serve. We continue to run full at our mills, with order backlogs of five to six weeks at low inventories, and we expect to continue to produce at capacity for the remainder of the year. ", "Many of the market participation strategies that John highlighted had a measurable impact on our performance in the Packaging Resources Group. We continue to gain market share in commercial print by using on-press comparisons to demonstrate the value of our Tango Advantage product to customers. We're accomplishing the same thing in the market for frozen food where performance characteristics, such as freeze-thaw strength and printability, are essential for demanding retail food brand owners around the world. And our innovative MWare line of paperboard for renewable cups in the food service market is growing rapidly as we leverage growth with key quick-serve restaurant customers. ", "We also continue to see excellent results in Rigesa, where earnings were up strongly for the quarter, driven by solid volume growth and contributions from improved pricing and productivity. Rigesa's outstanding performance and operating record continues to make a very positive contribution to the Packaging Resources segment. And as a platform, we may look to grow, as we've mentioned, with our ongoing evaluation of a new paper machine.", "The Consumer Solutions segment increased profits to $27 million during the quarter compared to $25 million last year. These better results were driven by strong volume increases and market share gains for higher-value packaging products in the personal care, healthcare and home and garden markets, as well as higher operating productivity. And the improvement was partially offset by $3 million of costs associated with the closure of a beverage packaging facility in France and negative impact from foreign exchange. ", "Sales in Consumer Solutions were about the same as last year, having exited certain lower margin business, we replaced nearly all of these volumes with sales of higher margin core products and solutions, improving the profitability of our revenue mix and contributing to the better performance in this segment.", "Let me go through each of the consumer packaging markets we serve in this business to highlight some of the impact of our market participation strategies. In our Global Beverage business, sales were higher but earnings were down compared to a very strong second quarter last year. During the quarter, we incurred a $3 million in cost as we completed the process to close our facility in France, and we incurred unfavorable foreign exchange. The facility closure will have an immediate impact on our productivity and results going forward, and we have successfully transitioned production to other locations and retained the customer base previously served by this beverage packaging plant. ", "The increase in beverage sales reflects above-market performance in Asia and North America and steady volumes in Europe. We won business in the U.S. by converting AB InBev corrugated volume to our paperboard solution for 18- and 20-count glass packs, and also earned some small share gains from key carbonated soft drink customers. We did not, however, gain a large amount of volume from recent promotional activities in the soft drink market. We continue to see very strong growth in Asia, where our business is up about 30% compared to last year and is maintaining a strong and steady growth trajectory with customers who continue to develop new multipack markets.", "In our Healthcare business, sales and earnings were down slightly during the quarter. We had a drop-off in sales for our paperboard adherence solutions in this market and also exited from unprofitable segments of our Folding Carton business. However, Shellpak volume is up more than 50% compared to last year as the number of prescription drugs and the number of customers continues to grow. We are in discussions with another large retailer to make Shellpak a central piece of their strategy to compete in the large and growing market for low-cost generic prescription drugs. Sales were also steady for both standard oral and nasal pumps, as well as our high-value, preservative-free pumps in Europe.", "The personal care markets continue to rebound from the lows we experienced last year. As a result, our business increased earnings again during the second quarter. Sales of our airless dispensers for skincare doubled compared to last year, as we gained market share with the biggest customers in the category. We also had very strong sales for fragrance dispensers, including our NoC pump that was recently awarded a patent in the United States and has helped us gain market share with key customers. ", "The Home and Garden business had strong sales and earnings during the second quarter. We had good performance in North America towards lawn maintenance and home surface cleaning, where we continue to grow with the market and see good adoption of our next generation aerosol dispenser. Sales have increased for this innovative product in the Home Care category, and we see potential to expand into other applications as well.", "We want our share of titles and projects for the upcoming busy season in the Media business, an important indicator of our competitive position. But the overall dynamics in this market continue to be very challenging. Sales and earnings were down as the market continues to decline, and we were impacted, as we were in our Other Plastics businesses, by higher prices for resin.", "Turning to our Non-Packaging businesses, the Consumer & Office Products segment had earnings equal to last year even with a slight decline in sales as some retailers planned their back-to-school category closer to pulling a sell-through to the consumer in the third quarter. This business has had steady year-over-year earnings improvement over the past few quarters, and we did well to perform in line with a very strong second quarter last year, in large part due to continued productivity actions. ", "In the quarter, the segment sold a somewhat weaker mix of products for back-to-school season in the U.S., as the timing of shipments of our proprietary branded products shifted into the third quarter. Sales of envelopes continued to decline, while there was a small uptick in sales of early-season time management and other office products. With the integration of Grafon's completed, we expect a solid back-to-school season in Brazil starting in the third and fourth quarters.", "Again, sales and earnings increased significantly in the Specialty Chemicals segment. Strong profit of $36 million and sales of $180 million were driven by volume growth and share gains in higher-value performance chemicals and the rebounding demand for our carbon solutions due to increased auto production. ", "Sales from emerging markets more than doubled, due in part to continued market penetration of the company's innovative asphalt solutions. These wins highlight the value of our formulation and application-based products have with our customers through the positive performance impact on varying products. The result is a more stable customer relationships and a rich product mix in growing markets.", "The Community and Land Management segment earned $12 million in the second quarter compared to just $3 million last year during a specially difficult period for the real estate market. The rural track land sales program continued with a good base of attractive deals, including $15 million of gross proceeds from 19 transactions that closed during the second quarter for an average price per acre of just under $2,600. The pace and value of transactions this year is holding steady, and there's been a measurable increase in interest for our properties and the number and quality of inquiries on our website. ", "We also continue to make progress on entitlements and improvements on our various development properties, including ongoing negotiations with Charleston, Dorchester Counties in South Carolina for East Edisto, preparations for another site at our distribution facility joint venture with the Rockefeller Group and the next phase of our master plan for The Parks of Berkeley development. ", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss some of our financial metrics for the second quarter. Mark?", "E. Rajkowski", "Thanks, Jim. We delivered another quarter of strong improvement across all key financial measures. Continued momentum in the execution of our market participation and business model strategies has enabled us to create a fundamentally more profitable company that we believe will provide sustainable performance improvement and deliver higher returns over the long term. The hard work to improve our competitive position in key end markets and enhance our product mix through better market participation choices were important drivers to our significant year-over-year profit growth.", "We also had solid cash performance, achieving good balance between maintaining our excellent financial strength, supporting our current sales gains and funding growth initiatives. Some financial highlights from our second quarter performance include volume growth of 8% in our core product segments, 360 basis points of improvement in adjusted operating margins and a 42% improvement in adjusted net cash flow from operations. I'll now provide more detail on each of these measures of our financial progress during the second quarter.", "Our overall sales growth in the second quarter was 8%. Volume improvement of 8% in our core products, price and mix benefits of 1.5% and modestly favorable foreign exchange were partially offset by the exit from lower-return product lines. As we continue to leverage investments we've made in new product innovation, a greater mix of our revenue is now coming from higher-value new products and customers. ", "During the second quarter, revenues from new products continued to grow as a percentage of our overall sales. Significant contributors include our innovative dispensing solutions for global beauty and personal care markets, our higher-value paperboard for commercial print and food service markets, our performance chemicals for global energy and infrastructure markets and continued success from our Shellpak product line.", "We also had a very strong contribution to growth from emerging markets. A 17% sales increase in the second quarter continues to be driven by our solid positions in China and Brazil. At current growth rates, emerging markets revenue is on track to reach approximately 25% of our annual consolidated sales in 2010.", "Improved product mix and the continued benefit of our productivity and overhead cost actions resulted in year-over-year improvement of 360 basis points in our operating margins. We're seeing clear evidence of the operating leverage we've created with our leaner cost structure. During the quarter, we achieved an additional $27 million in overhead and capacity savings, bringing the total for our strategic cost management programs to approximately $215 million to date, on track to achieve our $250 million target.", "This leverage and the mix benefits from our market participation strategies drove 230 basis points of adjusted gross margin improvement to 20.5%. Our SG&A cost continued to decline, primarily from ongoing overhead cost reductions. Our efforts to hold the line on variable cost while continuing to fund profitable revenue growth reduced adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales by 130 basis points to 11.8%. ", "Second quarter net cash flow from operations, which excludes the cash portion of restructuring and the fuel credits received in 2009, improved approximately $25 million or 42% over the prior year, driven by higher earnings. Despite increased levels of investment to grow our business, we continue to drive improvement in working capital efficiency, reducing our cash-to-cash cycle by five days versus the second quarter of last year. ", "CapEx in the second quarter was modestly lower versus the prior year as we continue to maintain our flexibility. While we do not intend to spend ahead of the economic recovery, we do have growth investments planned in the second half of the year that are better focused on building out our new product pipeline and augmenting our strong positions in emerging markets. For the full year, we expect to generate solid positive free cash flow, which we define as cash after CapEx and dividends.", "We continue to retain flexibility on our balance sheet, which we believe is prudent given the continued unsettled global economic climate. In the near term, we expect to maintain our current cash levels, and we'll continue with our balanced approach to reinvesting in our business, returning value to shareholders through our strong dividend and opportunistically reducing debt.", "Our outlook for the third quarter is cautiously optimistic. We believe that the improved demand trends across our targeted businesses and markets will remain stable, at least in the short term. With that, and the continued benefits from executing on our market participation and business model improvement strategies, we expect year-over-year earnings improvement for the third quarter. ", "Nevertheless, we do remain cautious about longer-term demand fundamentals given the ongoing macroeconomic challenges facing key markets and geographies, particularly in North America and Europe. As such, the degree of our improvement in the third quarter and beyond will be influenced by these factors.", "A more specific outlook for each of our business segments is as follows: We're expecting segment profit for Packaging Resources to be solidly above last year's level. Backlogs at our mills in the U.S. remain strong, between five and six weeks. The combination of strong demand, improving product mix and price, as well as ongoing productivity gains, will be the main drivers of higher earnings. We also expect continued improved profitability from Rigesa. Partially offsetting these factors will be a planned outage at our Covington mill, as well as modestly higher input cost for freight and certain raw materials. ", "In the Consumer Solutions Group, segment profit is expected to be modestly above year-ago levels. Stable demand in personal care and home and garden markets and continued growth in Shellpak healthcare packaging, as well as steady beverage volumes and productivity improvement will drive improved results. We expect these gains to be partially offset by the negative exchange impact of a weaker euro. ", "In the Consumer & Office Products segment, we're expecting another solid back-to-school season with profits flattish compared to last year's very strong third quarter performance. In the Specialty Chemicals segment, we expect profits to be up strongly over the year-ago quarter, and we expect continued strong demand across key product lines and improved product mix and productivity gains to be partially offset by modestly higher raw materials costs. ", "Finally, in the Community Development and Land Management business, sales of small tracks of land will continue to be the main driver of results. We expect segment profit to be at level similar to the second quarter. However, earnings will continue to be subject to the timing of our land sales. Now I'll turn it back to John.", "John Luke", "Thanks, Mark. In summary, the second quarter marked another period of strong performance for MWV. We continue to see the benefits of a disciplined approach to our transformation strategies, including profitable sales growth, a richer mix of products and solutions, improved productivity at our operating facilities and a reduced cost structure that has brought more of our commercial success to the bottom line. ", "While the economic outlook remains uncertain, MWV strategies have led to improved performance during what has been a challenging time, and we have confidence that continuing to execute these strategies will further strengthen our company and the returns that we deliver to shareholders. With this, we'll conclude our prepared remarks and now be happy to answer any questions which you have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We have a question from the line of Claudia Hueston with JPMorgan.", "Claudia Hueston - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I was hoping you could just talk a little bit more about the Chemicals business and the strengths there. The last couple of quarters, it's really exceeded our expectations. And I was hoping, could you just elaborate a little bit on the top line's trends and then how we should think about the sort of trajectory for growth in the second half?", "John Luke", "Sure, Claudia, I'll ask Jim to comment on that.", "James Buzzard", "Thanks, John. Claudia, in really building on the work we've been doing over the last several quarters is leading to the strong performance. As I said in my prepared comments, clearly, some of the infrastructure projects around the globe have helped in the Asphalt business. We have a very, very strong position in emerging markets, and so the growth there is delivering top line improvement for us. We have seen a rebound in the Automotive business in North America, certainly not back to the levels that we would have seen three and four years ago but better than 2009, and that's contributed to the top line. In terms of the profit improvement, it's driven by, with the really high value-added products that add real value to our customers and our ability to capture those, as well as an ongoing productivity program and all those things that come together to help drive the growth. And the last thing is we have made capital investments in this business. We expanded our refinery in DeRidder in 2008. We've made some modest downstream investments, and just as the growth has allowed us to take advantage of that capacity increase as well.", "John Luke", "Yes, I might just comment for a moment building on what Jim has said, which I think is all spot on. The group has built on its long-standing position of highly differentiated niche position to cross a range of markets and has continued to extend, as Jim said, globally, as well as built positions in, what in recent years have been wholly new and nicely profitable business, such as the asphalt market. And as a result, even when you see pressures in significant markets like carbon relative to historic periods, the group has continued to excel. And I think that reflects an excellent job done across that business.", "E. Rajkowski", "John, I'd add. We're really seeing some of the benefits from the investments we've made, not only in the refinery, as Jim mentioned, but also in China, particularly around automotive carbon and, as you mentioned, asphalt. So I think the team is really seeing the benefits of some of that investment early on.", "Claudia Hueston - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then just on the Packaging Resources business, I was particularly impressed by the strength in margins and the price mix improvement in the business. Is there any way to just maybe give us some guidance about how we should be thinking about price versus mix and how those gains might continue going forward? And maybe if you could just remind me of what price initiatives are still outstanding. I think there have been a couple of announcements recently.", "John Luke", "Claudia, I'll turn it over to Jim as well. But here again, echoing some of the same comments I offered about the Specialty Chemical business, in Packaging Resources, the folks have done a very fine job in continuing to build on the performance and quality characteristics of the paperboard, building, as we've commented in our prepared remarks, on targeted, strong and growing nicely profitable position in a variety of end markets. And I think that has been a major contributor to the volume, as well as overall mix and less margin improvement that you've commented on. Jim?", "James Buzzard", "Thanks, John. Just building on it, Claudia, in terms of some of the pricing actions, as you note, we've been moving price through the first half of this year. We do have some current announcements out, both in the SBS side and the CNK side that we're executing against. And we will continue to define the value that we provide in the markets and work to capture price as a result.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line up Chip Dillon with CSFB.", "Chip Dillon - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "If you could help, I guess this is more for Mark, just on the balance sheet. I noticed that the net debt in the first half actually went up which kind of surprised me. I show it going up $212 million roughly equal in the first and second quarter even though the working capital change was the same as it was a year ago. And of course in the first half of '09, the net debt went down. Is some of the debt and other currencies that might have gone up? Or is there anything you can do to help us on that?", "E. Rajkowski", "Yes, Chip. Most of that was a function of the cash balance. Our cash balance has come down as you know. We generally are users of cash in the first half of the year, and we are seeing some impact from currency on our cash balances as well. But most of that change in net debt is a function of the lower cash balance.", "Chip Dillon - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Okay. And then, I guess, getting back to Specialty Chemicals, which is obviously doing phenomenally well versus the past. As I look back at '07, '06, '08, let's say, when before the crisis began, it looks like you're doing substantially better, and I know you touched a little bit on it before. But is there something structurally different that has occurred here that you think will lead to $100-plus million type EBIT years on a consistent basis?", "James Buzzard", "Chip, I think it goes back to some of the earlier things we've talked about. Clearly the business has done a nice job in their market participation strategies, both in the geographic markets we participate in. But really in growing in new markets like oil field, the adhesives markets, asphalts, so they're really finding where they can use our products to create real value for our customers and in capturing that. So it's been a dramatic participation strategy that's been on. Certainly, the productivity that we've been driving, we've continued to expect to deliver on that. And as I said with the capacity, both -- as Mark noted in emerging markets, particularly China and also North America, all that's contributing. We expect that to continue going forward.", "Chip Dillon - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "On the land front, anything different as the economy suddenly recovers or maybe with Boeing building their plant, I guess, 30-or-so miles north of East Edisto, anything new there to add to how that is progressing?", "John Luke", "Chip, let me offer a few thoughts there. Nothing new that I would point to, specifically, but I would comment that the Charleston region continues to prosper relative to others in what arguably is a challenging real-estate-related credit market across the country. We've got a very, very strong team that's in position to capitalize on that. Boeing has been a plus for the Charleston region as has the terrific work done by the Port of Charleston, which has been able to bring a lot of strong business into the area. So our business outlook is good. We continue to develop sound plans. All of this and has enabled us to selectively continue to capitalize on our rural land sales program as we continue to plan and where appropriate, get entitlement rights for projects that we have underway. So we see a good strong bright future in that region.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "In Consumer Solutions, can you talk a little bit about where you stand on kind of the cost pass through and when we might expect to see that turn positive? In Consumer Solutions, where you stand.", "James Buzzard", "Sure. Certainly, you know in the resin side, we saw some increases in the early part of the second quarter. The vast majority of our business, we have contracts tied to full resin pass through. Those do lag sometimes by 30, 60, 90 days, but we would expect to have that fundamentally recaptured in the third quarter.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "And can you talk a little bit about the demand trends you saw as the second quarter progressed and economic uncertainties sort of increased and what you're seeing just on a relative basis in terms of trends entering the third quarter? I guess you've used the word stable, but just maybe a little more color, any specific end markets you might call out.", "John Luke", "Jim, you want to take that?", "James Buzzard", "Sure. I would say, again, we saw demand improving throughout our second quarter and as we enter the third quarter, it remains very strong. Our backlogs in our large paperboard mills are out five to six weeks, some machines are even longer than that. Our Chemical business is fundamentally solid for the entire quarter. And all of our other markets, we continue to see very positive trends. So as we go into the third quarter, we feel very positive about things.", "John Luke", "Yes, and I would just pick up on that and reinforce what Jim has said by emphasizing what we did in our prepared remarks, and that's we have good strong confidence in the strategies we're pursuing in each of the markets. And we believe that is a factor in addition to the broader economic forces that are improving the general markets. And I think that it is, as Jim has reinforced, there's a lot of uncertainty out there, and that's played back to us by our customers on a daily basis. But so far, we are continuing to see momentum, and I would attest that again, as I said in no small measure, that's attributable to our distinctive strategies.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "In the Mill business, you took a pretty big hit in the first quarter on the cost and efficiencies. And I don't think you were expecting to recoup all of that in the second quarter. But I just want to know, of that $25 million, is there any sort of update you can give in terms of what might be lost in the third quarter to recapture?", "James Buzzard", "Gail, in the second quarter, we probably had around $15 million or $16 million of impact from what happened in the first quarter. We think that is fundamentally behind us now, and so that impact has really been first half impact only.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "It seems to me that the question that is most on investors minds right now is whether you can sustain the productivity and cost reduction that you've put in place as demand comes back. I mean, sure we worry about the economy. But can you give us some more color to give investors more confidence that what you've taken out of SG&A, for example, is not going to just creep back in as business picks up on the top line?", "John Luke", "Let me offer a comment or two before turning to Mark to comment further. First of all, I think that we have fundamentally resolved and are demonstrating a major change in how we are doing things. And it's fair to say that a lot of these initiatives that you're seeing and that we're experiencing the benefits from were started before the downturn in the economy occurred. We have real disciplines in place and are absolutely committed to keeping this gearing going all while we make room to invest in growth today and invest in future growth when the economy hopefully returns to more robust levels. So we are absolutely committed, and I'm sure Mark can reaffirm that with a bit more specific.", "E. Rajkowski", "Yes, I think as John mentioned, we certainly recognize that not all SG&A is created equal. And we've been on a aggressive path in terms of taking out cost generally, but certainly, very much focused on those costs that aren't adding value or essential to driving our strategy in our business model improvements. So we will continue on that path. A lot of those costs are in the back office area, and that's going to be a relentless pursuit. So we can, as John said, continue to fund those opportunities to profitably grow our business.", "John Luke", "Right. And I would just pile on by saying that the cost structure changes that you've seen really are a product of the transformation that we're committed to as opposed to something that is driven by the events of the last 18 months.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "You did talk about growth opportunities and particularly in emerging markets, you didn't quantify it and you have said in the past, John, that you're going to be cautious about new spending initiatives. But can you give us an idea of the kind of stuff that is on your plate?", "John Luke", "Well, I think in each of the areas, Mark, that we talked about as being important to our current performance and our future strategy, we actively evaluate the potential as our customers continue to grow where we see opportunities to drive growth in certain markets, here and abroad, to evaluate opportunities for expansion, just as we are in Brazil or to evaluate the potential for select strategic business acquisitions, again, where it makes sense and where valuations are attractive. And I think there are no specific areas that I would or could point to right now, but suffice to say, each of the areas that we have talked about where the end markets are attractive, ranging from personal care and fragrance to healthcare to the broad markets in Brazil, are all part of the screening we have underway.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "In previous commentary, you've talked about import competition in the Consumer & Office business. Is that getting better? Or is it just less of an issue given everything else that's going on?", "James Buzzard", "Mark, this is Jim. We continue to face import competition. Our brands, however, are our strength,  and we've got nine of the 10 leading brands in back-to-school. So it's always that competition, but it tends to be more in the commodity end of the business, and we participate less there than we have historically.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "So hopefully less of an issue for you over the next year than it has been?", "James Buzzard", "I think that's right, yes.", "Operator", "And we have a question from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "George Staphos", "I wanted to come to the Consumer Solutions segment first with my question. Could you -- you talked a lot about new products in dispensing. Could you outline what you think the two or three most important products are for you within that category? And then with all the new products that you're discussing and the doubling of size in market, et cetera, what do you think the dollar revenue growth has been for you in dispensing systems year-on-year?", "James Buzzard", "George, in terms of the dispensing category, I would say the...", "George Staphos", "Well, but the newer products. I don't mean the trigger sprayers for long...", "James Buzzard", "So our airless technology is clearly an important one for us. That's one that we have brought into the personal care and healthcare markets. It's small but it is a very advantaged capability, and we saw tremendous growth in Q2, one that we think that we will continue to build off of. Another very important market for us is the fragrance market. I represented in my commentary, the NoC patent that we received in the United States, getting a lot of strong play from our customer base. We've taken some share in that arena. We're not as well represented in certain geographies as we would like to be candidly, and we think we've got the products that will now let us grow in those as well. So...", "George Staphos", "Jim, what kind of revenue growth did you see in fragrance year-on-year?", "E. Rajkowski", "Double-digit.", "James Buzzard", "Yes, it's double digit increases. I don't have the specific number right in front of me, George, but it was very, very strong.", "George Staphos", "But dollar revenue is still relatively small off a small base?", "James Buzzard", "It is a relatively small base, highly-profitable category for us and very important to the overall results that we delivered in Q2 from an EBIT standpoint.", "George Staphos", "And one more question within Consumer Solutions. As you're trading business in and trading business out, if you will, optimizing the portfolio, percentage margins are up a little bit but not all that much versus the prior year. You were in around, whatever, 4.5% on an operating margin basis. What kind of margin improvement do you expect going forward? And I guess the question behind the question, why aren't we seeing more margin improvement now given all that optimization of the portfolio?", "James Buzzard", "George, I think that we referenced we had some onetime hits that caught us in Q2, particularly the decision to close our facility in France, which is about a $3 million impact to us. That's going to start to accrue to us beginning in Q3. And candidly, we had some operating difficulties in the second quarter as well. A lot of promotional work in the beverage markets drove a different package format for us, one that is not quite as profitable, and it also meant that we were having to move our facilities around because our mix of product that we produce is quite a bit different than it has been historically. So those things are behind us. We learned a lot, frankly, and we would enter the next promotional season a little bit differently. So we continue to believe that we will drive improving operating margins in this business.", "John Luke", "Yes, and I would just punctuate that by saying that underlying what are the surface numbers as Jim has indicated is good momentum, and we have good confidence that these strategies that are being pursued will lead to the achievement of the kind of margins that we'll all be pleased with.", "George Staphos", "First, did you mention why CNK pricing was off a little bit, I think, sequentially in the quarter? And then given all the overhead and cost reductions, if again, I look at the corporate line buildup, it was up I think both year-on-year and sequentially. Is that just the same accruing of, I think incentives, and other expenses this year and the underlying trend is more positive?", "E. Rajkowski", "George, I'll handle your last question first on the corporate line. Yes, there's always a little bit of noise relative to accruals around employee benefits, incentive, legal and environmental reserves. And we had some credits in the first quarter of this year and a few charges in the second quarter this year, so you saw a little bit of a sequential spike up there.", "George Staphos", "And CNK?", "James Buzzard", "Yes, on that basis, George, purely mix. There's no price moves in that. As you know, we announced for CUK, for folding carton application the price increase, and we're implementing that as we speak.", "Operator", "And we have a question from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Is it possible within Packaging Resources to get a sense of how much of that upside was driven by Rigesa?", "E. Rajkowski", "Well, Rigesa, certainly, was a strong contributor. We have, and at least we're not going to start right now, Mark, breaking that out. But I will tell you that we had very strong performance, both in terms of volume price and productivity in the Rigesa's operations.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "And is it possible, Mark, just going forward that we might get some more color on Rigesa just so we know how profitable the business is, particularly as you're going to be putting more capital down there in all likelihood?", "E. Rajkowski", "Yes, I think that is a fair request, Mark. And as John and Jim both pointed out earlier, we do see that region generally and business specifically as having great opportunity. We are looking at deploying more capital there, and I think as we do that, that is a very fair request.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Can I also ask on that, you haven't announced the machine yet, you're starting it. But have you been buying land over the last couple of years down there?", "E. Rajkowski", "We have not.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "So what's the base down there right now?", "E. Rajkowski", "135,000 acres.", "James Buzzard", "And with what we have planned down there, Mark, we will not have to make any additional land investments. Our core productivity on those forestlands and the products that we're trying to design down there, we will not need additional investments to support a new machine.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "And then I wonder if I could turn and just talk about the broader kind of MeadWestvaco portfolio. I mean, you're really kind of trying to turn this into much more of a packaging converting company. And I just wonder, how does the Consumer & Office Products business in particular got a foot within that framework? And do you think there would be a value in having the company even more tightly focused on just packaging or maybe packaging plus the Specialty Chemicals business?", "James Buzzard", "Mark, I mean, clearly, the Consumer & Office Products business is a very good business for us. It's one that, like our Packaging business, is driven by innovation and strong products. Their insights and access to key retailers helps us as we think about our Packaging business as well. So it is a strong portfolio of businesses with great cash generation and great returns. So we see it as helping us in certain areas around the Packaging business and certainly not doing anything that would be negative relative to our visions for our packaging platform.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Beginning about 10 or 12 years ago, you really moved the business kind of away from the mills and toward more of the Converting business. But if you look over the last couple of years, it seems like more the leverage for you on the upside is really coming from the mills now. And I wonder to what extent you're kind of rethinking strategy because of that?", "John Luke", "Mark, as you know, strategy we think is a continuing process particularly in a growing rapidly changing world, certainly given the one we've all been through in the last several years. I think we have recognized, as we always have, that our mills can be a powerful contributor. We've worked, though, based upon the knowledge we've gotten through the converting work now through our primary plastic work in targeted end markets to take our knowledge of markets where profitability can be more effectively generated in those end markets and apply even more of that to our Mill business. And so it's a combination of gains that are being generated in each segment of our business that you're seeing. But it is fundamentally a better understanding of where the markets are representing opportunity for us to bring valued products and solutions and participate and profitably growing ways that is driving our thinking and strategizing today.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "So away from Rigesa, you're probably not likely to be investing in other mill operations? Is that right?", "John Luke", "Well, let me answer in the affirmative. The mill operations and broader packaging markets in Brazil are very, very attractive. One, you've got substantial and attractive growth underway in Brazil and end markets that are attractive to us for a range of packaging products. And as Jim commented, the productivity in the mill operations in Brazil begin right in the forest. Because as you know, we've got uniquely fast growing trees down there and the technology that we're employing to grow our own trees is arguably among the best in the world. And so it is from a shareholder value generation perspective, our view that the best investments one could make in heavy capital assets would be in Brazil.", "Operator", "And our question is from the line of Peter Ruschmeier with Barclays Capital.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Quick question on the Chemicals business, we were surprised as well by the strength. If we look at the 55% year-over-year gain on the top line, can you help us to break that down between how much of that was driven by volume versus price?", "E. Rajkowski", "Yes, Pete, this is Mark. Roughly 45% of that was volume driven, and that was pretty evenly distributed across both our Performance Chemicals businesses as well as our Carbon business. So most of that was volume growth, but we also saw improvement in pricing and mix as Jim mentioned earlier.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "And does your outlook call for Performance Chemicals and Carbon to hold onto these gains? Or is there any reason we expect for a variety of reasons those volumes to fall off?", "E. Rajkowski", "Well, some of this is obviously predicated upon where the economy hit. But as Jim mentioned earlier, we are running very hard to keep up with demand. Certainly, the current trends are positive, and certainly, we expect to sustain that at least in the near term.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "And I have some quick cash flow items, maybe, Mark. Cash taxes in the quarter, were they materially different than your reported book tax?", "E. Rajkowski", "You know what, I don't believe so. But I'll make sure we get back to you on that one, Pete. I don't think that's a big deal.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "And similar question on interest expense, was there any material, a timing issue that would have resulted in a different cash interest pay versus the ones you booked?", "E. Rajkowski", "No, pretty stable.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "And just lastly if I could, maybe a question for Jim or John on Consumer Solutions. Is it fair that, that business is benefiting on a one hand from initiatives you've talked about on new products and higher margins and productivity? And on a flip side, you've got a bit of a decline and still in the Media Packaging business, is that fair that there were puts and takes? And are the improvements in growth that you've talked about enough to offset what I think is still a declining volume growth in the Media Packaging side?", "John Luke", "Now let me take this to the high level and encourage Jim or Mark to offer any comment. I think one of the things, and it builds a little bit off of Mark Wilde's question a moment ago as well. The closer you get to the end markets, participate whether it's in a business like media or others, you're going to see more volatility because you're going to have shorter life cycles both in terms of products as well as in categories. What we have worked very hard to do with better understanding of the markets is build positions through establishing a much deeper market knowledge and the development of products and solutions to participate in others to more than offset declines as they come along. And that is a key part of the strategy and is driving progress, both in Consumer Solutions, driving our strategic progress there as well certainly in our Mill-based businesses. Jim?", "James Buzzard", "Yes, the only thing I would add to that John is that clearly Q-over-Q, last year, we began in the back of the year an active market participation strategy where we exited certain folding carton segments, and we've been able to offset those exits with these new products and growth in the markets that we've targeted. So I think you will continue to see us push for that growth, particularly in the new products and the geographies we're targeting.", "Jason Thompson", "All right, Coleman, I'll take it from here. Thanks everyone for joining us, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Take care.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our teleconference call for today.

Welcome to the MeadWestvaco Third Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Jason Thompson, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jason Thompson", "Thanks, Roxanne, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced our results before the market opened. The notification of this morning's call was broadly disclosed and further, this morning's call is being webcast at mwv.com and slides that accompany this call are available there as well.", "I'll briefly remind you that certain statements we make are forward-looking and are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties described in our public filings. Furthermore, contents contain time-sensitive information that, although correct today, may change with the passage of time.", "First, a brief recap of the results we reported this morning. For the third quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $111 million or $0.64 per share. These results include a one-time tax benefit of $15 million or $0.09 per share and after-tax charges for restructuring and early retirement of debt totaling $14 million or $0.08 per share. Now here to tell you more about our results for the third quarter are John Luke, Chairman and CEO; Jim Buzzard, our President; and Mark Rajkowski, CFO.", "I'll now turn the call over to John.", "John Luke", "Jason, thanks, and good morning. In the third quarter, the MWV organization's execution of our value-based strategy continued to deliver stronger, more sustainable earnings performance from each of our businesses. This progress is particularly apparent in our market-focused strategic business units for Packaging, whose revenues represent the principal output of our efficient paperboard converting and injection molding manufacturing system.", "With these market-focused business units, we're building new and deeper partnerships with customers, improving the overall mix of high-value products and packaging solutions and achieving share gains in targeted, attractive end markets and geographies. This progress is the foundation for MWV's continuing transformation and is contributing soundly to the company's improved performance and our very strong prospects for profitable growth, just as our similar strategies in our Specialty Chemicals, Consumer & Office Products and Community Development and Land Management businesses.", "Some highlights from the quarter include adjusted earnings per share of $0.63, a 4% volume growth from core products, a 28% increase in earnings from our Packaging businesses, a remarkable 83% profit increase from our Specialty Chemicals business and the sale of our Media Packaging business.", "With those highlights in mind, let me provide some details on the progress we're making in each of our packaging end markets, progress that we expect will continue to drive improvement across our packaging platform.", "Turning first to the beverage market. In the global beverage markets, trends are flat to slightly down in the mature markets of North America and Europe but the opportunities are very large in emerging markets, especially across Asia and Latin America. Our beverage packaging business has outpaced these trends for several quarters, with sales volume roughly the same year-over-year in North America and Europe and double-digit growth in emerging markets.", "We are leveraging our global footprint and systems value proposition to grow along with customers in emerging markets by offering better speed-to-market, increased productivity for their operations and more product flexibility, and our pipeline for both innovation and high-end machinery solutions in this business is very strong.", "In the large global food and food services markets, our business team is working directly with brand owners and retailers to specify MWV paperboard solutions for frozen food packaging, ready-to-eat meals and hot drink cups. Our focus on these demanding applications help generate strong double-digit sales and profit growth in these markets during the quarter.", "Looking forward, the beneficial environmental features of our new MWare line of paperboard for compostable cups and other food service products have generated excellent potential for participation in global quick serve restaurant chains. And we recently launched a new product called Captivate. Captivate is a shelf-ready and shopper-friendly packaging solution for canned goods, pet food, frozen juice, yogurt and other consumer goods. It delivers benefits for the brand owner, the retail operator and the shopper, with a billboard effect on crowded store shelves, supply-chain efficiencies and shrinkage or theft reduction benefits and a better overall shopping experience for consumers. Captivate is a great example of the way we are using brand and consumer insights to develop innovation in packaging. And in addition to applications in the retail food market, it has strong potential in the beverage and healthcare markets as well.", "Turning to our Healthcare business, we're focused on extending our leading position in value-added adherence packaging. Demand for Shellpak was steady in the third quarter, and we are adding a new drug to the program with our biggest customer, Wal-Mart, that will increase volume by about 15% beginning this December.", "We are also beginning a partnership with Kroger on an initial launch of Shellpak for its Health Matters prescription drug program. This partnership with Kroger will include educational materials for pharmacists and patients, as well as in-store promotions, and we expect to be able to demonstrate significant sales lift with the switch to Shellpak for many of its generic prescription offerings.", "In the beauty and personal care market, we had another increase in overall revenues during the third quarter as we gained share for both our airless dispensers and fragrance pumps. We doubled volumes of our airless dispensers for skin care during the quarter and had a 45% growth in the fragrance product sales. There, we launched a one-of-a-kind customized product for the new Voyage d'Herm\u00e8s fragrance line, a sustainability solution that we developed in partnership with one of the world's most admired luxury brands.", "As the home and garden busy season came to a close, we posted very strong performance for our core trigger sprayers and custom applicators. We're very pleased with the continued strength of our next-generation aerosol sprayers as we're capturing a larger share of business from key global customers such as Procter & Gamble, Unilever and SC Johnson. And we have strategic initiatives underway in this business that will strengthen our position for further growth in Europe and emerging markets.", "In the global tobacco market, our strategy is to focus on the premium and ultra premium categories, and our sales continue to increase in several markets around the world, even as they decline here in the United States. Our global customer base increasingly recognizes and rewards us for the value of our new prominent tobacco paperboard solution, which delivers a unique combination of appearance, characteristics and performance consistency, along with environmental or sustainability benefits. Beyond this, we continue to help customers develop packaging solutions for growing categories such as smokeless tobacco products.", "We are also participating extensively across a number of markets in Brazil, served primarily by Rigesa. We've seen robust growth in that country that reflects the expansion and increased buying power of the middle class. We increased sales in Brazil during the quarter compared to the prior year, with especially strong double-digit growth in packaging for frozen meat, fresh produce and other food products. Rigesa's integrated corrugated packaging business continues to be a source of real competitive advantage. And the positive trajectory of Brazil's economy represents very good opportunity for all of our Packaging businesses, as well as for our market-leading school and office products.", "As I hope you can see, our organized approach to participating in targeted packaging markets through our strategic business units has contributed significantly to our current progress while also identifying new opportunities for future profitable growth. We have a disciplined focus on attractive, faster-growing and profitable global end markets where we can successfully leverage our knowledge and capabilities to develop deeper partnerships with customers based on industry-leading insights into consumer behavior, brand value and innovation and this is generating real progress and benefit. I'll now turn to Jim who will report on our operational and segment performance, and Mark will follow with a review of our financial metrics, as well as an outlook for the remaining months of this year. After that, we will turn to your questions. Jim?", "James Buzzard", "Thank you, John. We continue to have success with our market participation strategies, and we continue to translate that success into improved operating results and financial performance. Overall, sales were up 3% during the third quarter compared to last year, with core volume up 4% as John mentioned.", "Over the past year, we have significantly changed our business mix, and our greatest gains were at the high-value products and solutions we've emphasized in our most profitable markets. Along with the widespread progress from our market participation strategy, we've also continued with an intense focus on cost reductions and operating and sourcing productivity across our manufacturing platform. That includes our paperboard mills, converting plants, injection molding facilities and chemical refineries.", "As part of the strategic cost management plan we've been executing, we achieved an additional $22 million in savings during the third quarter. We expect to reach the $250 million run rate target we set during the fourth quarter, along with the ongoing benefits of our sourcing initiatives and operating excellence program, these savings have been important contributors to our overall margin expansion.", "Overall, the transformation of our business model through execution of our value-added strategies drove adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and special items up 11% to a record $171 million. With those headlines in mind, representative of progress that we've made across our markets, I'd like to provide some quick details for each of our segments. Additional information is available on our press release and the slides that accompany this call.", "In the Packaging Resources segment, as John noted, our brand order engagement strategy has improved performance, with overall sales up 12% across our market-focused strategic business units. Shipments of bleached board were the same as last year, though we only ran five machines this quarter after shutting down the machine at our Evadale mill last year. And shipments of Coated Natural Kraft were up 14%, reflecting gains in retail food packaging and a return to more normal beverage ordering patterns compared with a weak third quarter in 2009.", "Segment profit was up by 23% to $91 million in the quarter, with higher sales and a richer product mix, as well as improved productivity despite a planned outage at our Covington mill that we did not have during the third quarter of 2009. We continue to run full at our mills, with order backlogs of five to six weeks while maintaining low inventory levels.", "In the Consumer Solutions segment, we are pleased with the step change in profitability we are achieving with our strengthened business model as segment operating profit increased 41% to $38 million or 8.3% of sales. Benefits of our improving business mix were visible with the completion of the sale of our Media Packaging business, and we continue to have better overall productivity performance in this segment.", "On the sales side, we made good progress during the quarter in many of the markets we serve in Consumer Solutions, several of which John has already identified. Even with this good volume growth, the impact of strategic business exits and unfavorable foreign currency exchange resulted in modestly slower sales in this segment.", "In the Consumer & Office Products segment, the back-to-school season in North America was in line with our expectations. There was good sell-through of our leading branded products, including increases for our new Early Learning line. Overall however, there was not as much retailer promotional activity for this category compared to last year and envelope sales continued to decline. So overall sales were down about 5% and earnings in this segment were essentially unchanged at $50 million. Looking ahead, order volume has been good in Brazil heading into what we believe will be a solid back-to-school season there.", "In the Specialty Chemicals segment, we continued to capitalize on the advantages we've created through timely investments in emerging markets, capacity expansion and new product development. We had strong sales of more profitable products for markets such as oil field chemicals and asphalt additives, especially in emerging markets and a rebound in auto carbons as well, as global auto production has increased. As a result, it was another record quarter, with sales up 22% and earnings up 83% to $44 million in this segment.", "In Community Development and Land Management, we continue to progress nicely with development activities at our industrial and commercial sites. We remain on time and on budget with the first industrial warehouse as part of our joint venture with the Rockefeller Group, and we expect TBC Corporation to take occupancy of the completed building in January.", "In a very difficult market for rural land sales, we maintained a disciplined approach to extracting value from our select properties, with a strong average price per acre during the quarter of over $2,800. Renewed economic concerns during the quarter delayed some closings, and as a result, our sales and earnings in the segment were lower than expected compared to a very strong performance last year. As the confidence of individual buyers increases, we expect a higher close rate on rural properties.", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss some of our financial metrics for the third quarter. Mark?", "E. Rajkowski", "Thanks, Jim. Across the board, our third quarter operating results were very strong and reflect a more robust business model we've created for our company. We achieved record adjusted operating profit in the quarter, pushing our total through the first nine months, well past what we achieved for all of 2009.", "Some highlights from the quarter include: significantly improved price and mix contribution to both our top and bottom line. This is the result of strong commercial execution in our targeted end markets; solid margin and profit growth, a continued benefit of our more competitive cost structure; excellent cash performance with cash flow from continuing operations of approximately $270 million; and balanced and disciplined cash deployment as we opportunistically repurchased stock and debt and continued to invest to profitably grow our businesses.", "I'll now provide more detail on our progress in these areas and then share our outlook for the fourth quarter. We generated 4% growth from our core products, where volumes improved 4%, and price and mix contributed an additional 5%, driven largely by strong performance in our packaging platform. This improvement was partially offset by the exit of lower-return product lines, unfavorable foreign exchange and lower land sales.", "Key revenue drivers during the third quarter were increased sales of higher-margin products, particularly in the global food market, home and garden market, targeted personal care products as well as in healthcare packaging. Sales from emerging markets were also a significant contributor. Rigesa's strong performance in Brazil and our airless dispenser and leveraging packaging in Asia drove 13% emerging markets sales growth across our Packaging businesses. Emerging markets now comprise more than a quarter of our total packaging sales.", "Continued momentum from new product innovation and commercialization was a key factor in our third quarter revenue growth, with contributions from Shellpak, our NoC fragrance and airless dispenser products, MWare compostable food service paperboard, Promina tobacco paperboard and Tango Advantage for the Commercial Print market. Our improved product mix, higher prices and leaner cost structure drove higher operating margin rates across our Packaging Businesses, as well as in Specialty Chemicals and Consumer & Office Products. The result is third quarter adjusted operating profit growth of 11% to $171 million and an adjusted operating margin of 11%, both new high watermarks for MWV.", "SG&A as a percentage of sales was up modestly over the prior year. This is the result of a couple of factors. The first is for investments associated with new systems and processes to realign our European operations consistent with our focus around end markets. Second factor is related to investments we are making to accelerate profitable growth, including opportunities we have in emerging markets to continue to drive the very strong growth we're generating today, as well as investments in innovative new products and our commercial organization.", "Our all-in tax rate for the quarter was a benefit of 2% due to a number of discrete items required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles to be recorded in the quarter. As a result and on this basis, we now expect the annual effective tax rate for the year to be 20%. However, from an operational perspective, which excludes all special and discrete items, we expect the normalized tax rate to be approximately 28% for the year.", "Our cash performance during the third quarter was excellent. Cash flow from continuing operations of approximately $270 million was driven by higher earnings and continued improvement in working capital efficiency. During the quarter, we generated $125 million of free cash flow, defined as cash after CapEx and dividends. We ended the quarter with $774 million of cash, which is an increase of $115 million from the last quarter. We maintained our disciplined and balanced approach to cash deployment. We repurchased about $100 million of our 2012 debentures, leaving us with maturities of about $220 million.", "We also repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares of common stock for $60 million in the open market. These actions were funded by the proceeds from the sale of the Media business and existing cash reserves. We will continue to be balanced and opportunistic with our cash resources, including bolt-on acquisition opportunities to augment positions in growing global markets with attractive businesses.", "Now, turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. Across our markets, we see generally stable demand trends but at levels that are below what we saw before the global recession. We continue to build momentum in our markets and gain confidence in our ability to drive performance improvement as we continue to focus on high-return products and markets and deliver cost savings to the bottom line.", "The share gains we've earned for our higher-margin products, our investments in emerging markets in recent as well as future new product launches, position us well for continued profitable growth in our Packaging business going forward. Current macroeconomic trends, particularly in North America and Europe, remain challenging. However, at current levels of demand, we expect to continue our strong year-over-year margin and earnings improvement trajectory in the fourth quarter.", "Taking a closer look at our segments and starting with the Packaging Resources segment, earnings will be well above the year-ago fourth quarter. Backlogs remain above normal seasonal levels at five to six weeks, with demand remaining solid in food, food service, tobacco and beverage markets, as well as in key markets in Brazil. Continued mix and price improvement, productivity gains, increased profitability from Rigesa will be the main drivers of the segment's expected stronger performance. Partially offsetting these factors will be higher year-over-year input costs, particularly for freight and certain key raw materials such as fiber and OCC.", "In the Consumer Solutions segment, profit is expected to be well above year-ago levels. Demand remains stable across our key markets, including personal care, home and garden and beverage, and we will see some volume growth for Shellpak with the addition of a new drug and new customers during the fourth quarter. There'll also be a positive impact from improved productivity in this segment during the fourth quarter.", "In the Consumer & Office Products business, the planning and calendar season will be solid and the initial back-to-school selling in Brazil has gotten off to a good start. As such, segment profits will be comparable to last year's very strong results.", "In the Specialty Chemicals segment, profits will be well above the year-ago fourth quarter. Continued strong demand across all product lines and productivity gains will be the main drivers of the improvement.", "In our Community Development and Land Management business, market conditions for rural land sales remain weak, and the ultimate level of sales and earnings are difficult to forecast. However, we do expect a more normal level of sales in the fourth quarter based on the current pipeline of transactions. We continue to be enthusiastic about the opportunities in both our rural land program, as well as the excellent progress we're making in our industrial and commercial development properties.", "With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.", "John Luke", "Thanks, Mark. To summarize, MWV's performance during the third quarter reflects the significant momentum we have generated by focusing on our participation in targeted end markets and the directly-related execution of our value-based strategy. But the changes we have made are bigger and more sustainable than any single quarter's results. What you've seen from MWV over the last almost two years is the direct result of an ongoing transformation in our business model and in the way we do business, backed up by a list of marketplace successes and earnings performances that bear out that approach.", "Recognizing that uncertainties continue to exist in the global economy, MWV shareholders can have confidence as we do, that we will continue to capitalize on the strengths we've built with our value-based market participation strategies and that we can sustain and bolster our relative performance as a global packaging leader.", "We'll now be happy to address whatever questions you have this morning.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Chip Dillon - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Along those lines, when you look at the Chemical segment, a lot of us don't really cover chemicals, and it's just been fabulous seeing the last two quarters. Do you see the fourth quarter being sequentially anywhere in the same ballpark as the third or even the second quarter was? And as we think about it, is there any reason we couldn't see let's say the middle quarters of next year be in the ballpark of where the second, third quarter were this year? In other words, was there something unusually good this year that we might not see next year?", "John Luke", "I would just acknowledge upfront that what you're seeing in the Chemical business is the result of an ongoing effort, a transformation in that business as well that's a result of good market knowledge, good market penetration and ongoing development of position with innovative, industry-oriented products that really reflects a tremendous progress. So what you're seeing is something that we really believe is nicely sustainable in this business. Jim?", "James Buzzard", "Thanks, John. Chip, as we look to the fourth quarter, we need to recognize that we do have the seasonal weakness that comes with the quarter. Certain markets like asphalt, you know, paving those go down. So we will be stronger year-on-year but sequentially weaker than the third quarter. In addition, we've got two outages in the third quarter at major facilities so that will impact us as well. But we expect a solid improvement year-on-year. As we look to next year, as John said, we believe that the results we're seeing are sustainable. They're being driven by productivity, by the globalization of the business as we move particularly in the emerging markets and really our innovation in new products. And what's been driving the performance of this business for the last two years are those three things, and we think that will certainly continue to go into next year.", "Chip Dillon - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And one quick follow-up is you had a nice $200 million -- on my calculation, at least almost $250 million reduction in your net debt in the third quarter, and it seems like most -- in fact, every year in the last four or five, you've seen a reduction in net debt in the fourth quarter, maybe part of that is seasonal with working capital. So it looks like that number's approaching $1 billion. And so with that in mind, can you refresh us sort of on how much you have left on your buyback authorization? And maybe what your thoughts are about the dividend as your earnings go up and your debt goes down as we look at 2011?", "E. Rajkowski", "We are certainly seasonally stronger relative to our cash flow in the second half of the year. Q3 was a great quarter for us. You're right, our net debt is down. We're just north of 28%. And we have and we will continue to remain very balanced in terms of how we deploy our cash as I noted in my comments earlier, we did take about $100 million of our 2012 maturities down. We did opportunistically repurchase shares, given the price earlier in the quarter. And on that note, there remains a little bit over 3 million shares available under that authorization, and we continue to view returning value to shareholders as extremely important.", "Chip Dillon - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Any thoughts on the dividend as you look at next year?", "E. Rajkowski", "The dividend is a function of continuing to drive cash flows. And right now, we're still trying to close out the year and as we head into next year, we'll certainly be taking a closer look at that.", "James Buzzard", "I think that's right, Chip. If you take the elements that you know that we are looking at and Mark summarized debt reduction, repurchase of equity and the dividend, among other things, those are all issues that are under continuing evaluation as you would expect by management and the board. And as we move through the balance of the year, the priority attached to each one of those will be clearer.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "George Staphos", "I guess the first question I have is around PRI, and specifically bleached. This quarter, if I heard and read correctly, you said your volumes were flat year-on-year. I thought in the prior two quarters this year, volumes were up some. So aside from the fact that the machine came down last year, was there anything else going on in bleached that we should be aware of, concerned with in terms of the sequential decline or deceleration year-on-year?", "James Buzzard", "No, nothing to be concerned about. If you remember, last year, we were slowed back. We were taking some market-related downtime given the weakness of the markets. Those snapped back in good shape in Q3. So really, it's an impact of the fact that we don't have number two machine at Evadale and that's worth about 5% of shipment volume quarter-on-quarter.", "George Staphos", "But that was similar impact in 1Q and 2Q, was it not, Jim?", "James Buzzard", "No. We ran the machine in Q1 and Q2 of 2009. We took it down in August of 2009.", "E. Rajkowski", "I'll handle this off-line, but my guess is that comparative factor was equally there and present in the first quarter through the third quarter this year.", "James Buzzard", "We'll take it off-line, George.", "George Staphos", "Backlogs, you mentioned your backlogs are five to six weeks, at least they were in the third quarter. Has that changed materially through the first few weeks of October? Are you still at that level again in bleached?", "James Buzzard", "We're still at that level in bleached.", "George Staphos", "Thirdly, on corporate expense, that was up $20 million year-on-year, if I'm looking at Slide 15 correctly. Can you go through again what's driving that variance?", "John Luke", "Year-over-year, George, I think we were up for the quarter about $6 million.", "George Staphos", "I'm sorry. That's correct but versus second quarter, you're up $15 million?", "E. Rajkowski", "Yes. Quarter sequentially, we're up about $15 million and really, two primary drivers there. One is related to incentive comp and stock compensation, which is really a function of performance and the stock price so as that changes, those accruals move. And the other piece of it relates to some investments that I referenced earlier in my comments related to some systems work that we're doing to help enable growth in our business.", "George Staphos", "And you wouldn't aggregate those within the businesses, so you do that on a corporate basis then?", "John Luke", "Some of it gets pushed down the business but these are more enterprise-wide investments.", "George Staphos", "Two last ones. One, can you update us if you have a view on your outlook for pension? If you need to fund at all next year? I know you've been over-funded in the past and where expense line might be -- or income line might be? And then on dispensing systems within Consumer Solutions, what kind of outlook are you hearing about from your customers on new products?", "John Luke", "I'll address your pension question. Jim will follow up on the dispenser side. But the pension fund remains well over-funded, almost 140%. And there's no funding requirements for next year or the foreseeable future.", "James Buzzard", "And George, in your question on dispensing solutions, we do continue to see our customers begin to put new launches out, and as we referenced in the call, we've seen strong growth particularly in the Fragrance and our Fine Mist Sprayer business. And I now have understood your question on the paper machine in Q1 and Q2. The fundamental difference is Q1 and Q2, we were pulling down inventories. Now our inventories are very clean, and what we're doing is shipping everything we're making at this point.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "So with respect to Consumer Solutions, when I look at your waterfall chart, pricing mix hasn't kept up with inflation this quarter. Can you talk about how those two are working in your mind over the next, say six months? Do we have a mix issue here? Or are we still struggling structurally to be able to price these? Obviously, you've offset tons of it with productivity so it hasn't mattered in the short run, but I'm trying to get a better handle on where that business really is.", "John Luke", "Let me offer a couple of overall thoughts, Mark, and then I'll ask Jim and Mark to weigh in. I think that clearly, this is something that we've been working hard to address. I think we're making excellent progress. We've been refining our mix. And as you look over the coming several months, I think you'll see a very different story. We've got real emphasis and real progress that we're posting.", "James Buzzard", "Let me just add to that, John. Really, Mark, it's a timing issue for us. So we've seen some inflation, particularly in the plastics, the Dispensing business around resin and stainless steel. As you know, a lot of that business is covered by contractual increases but those may be delayed 30 days, 90 days. And so we should begin to see that move more favorably through the end of the year.", "E. Rajkowski", "And as I pointed out, just to emphasize the point John made earlier, we'd expect that relationship certainly to improve in the fourth quarter.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "John, you've talked about a lot about Rigesa in the past as a platform more broadly than Containerboard. Can you give us an update on the other side of Rigesa?", "John Luke", "I'm trying to understand exactly where you're going. Let me comment...", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "We spent three or four years saying, why don't you sell this thing? And you came back and said, we're actually going to capitalize on that brand and do something more with it.", "John Luke", "I think I have a better sense of where you're coming from, Mark. Rigesa's been a great business for us for a good many years. And as I emphasized in my prepared comments, it's integrated strategy from the forest [forestland] right through the high-quality corrugated Packaging business. It's, without question, the market leader in Brazil and has provided us huge and sustained advantage, and with that, a platform for growth. We would expect with opportunities we're evaluating in Brazil to grow that platform and to ride the curve and indeed leave the curve of the tremendous growth that is underway in Brazil today, with the good economic leadership that we're seeing in that country and how it's being specifically manifest in the growth of the middle class in that country. More broadly, as we look at the so-called Rigesa platform, we see an opportunity in the nearer term to use it and its brand franchise to team up with the MWV brand franchise to participate much more broadly in the growth of a series of packaging markets that we have participated in, in a modest fashion but we would expect to do so more broadly, whether it's beauty and personal care, food market, beverage markets among others. So we see a strong brand franchise, a very profitable strong business and a country that is growing very nicely. We also see, just to round out the story, the opportunity now and over time for that business as we continue to expand it. In doing so, I would underscore, with a real disciplined eye on profitability, to be a leading participant in the export markets, not only within South America but quite possibly outside of South America.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "So when you say that MeadWestvaco is ready for opportunities, Brazil be reasonably very high in that list, is that fair?", "John Luke", "I'm sorry, can you -- I can't hear you.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "When you say that MeadWestvaco is ready for opportunities, would you put Brazil pretty high in that list?", "John Luke", "I think Brazil, without question, high on that list. I think one of the things that we probably could talk about off-line because it would take longer than we have on the balance of this call. But as you know, and we've had fun talking about over time, we've been in Brazil for over 60 years. We understand that country well. We understand the fundamentals. We understand when things are good and when things aren't so good. So our interest in Brazil today predates and our interest in expanding in Brazil today predates some of the hot growth that we're seeing right now. Our thinking really cuts through the trajectory, recognizing that there's some hot stuff going on in that country and looks at the fundamentals and gives us good opportunity to leverage knowledge of the market, people, excellent team that we have there and the opportunities to grow with a sustained long-term bias in mind. So Brazil is definitely high on our list. But I wouldn't want to exclude other parts of the world where we've invested perhaps more modestly than Brazil but certainly, an awful lot in developing knowledge over time. China is obviously a market that's important to us. But India holds a very attractive appeal as well, and we've invested in building some modest positions there and importantly, in understanding market developments in that country as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Going back to Mark's question on Consumer Solutions, but looking maybe more strategically -- x the sale of Media, can you give us a sense of what you think you can do with margins there moving forward? And can you build off of what you reported kind of x media this quarter and is there any target that we should be looking for?", "John Luke", "Well, Gail, I don't think that we want to put a target out there but you can be sure that our focus is very much not only in keeping up with inflation but shaping our mix with the value-based solutions orientation that you're familiar that we have in place to participate in ways that let us continue to expand those margins. Our goal is clearly to ensure that those business or earnings sound economic profit or above cost of capital returns. And we believe that the mix of products, the markets that we're participating in, with that mix of products and the growth characteristics of those markets, give us a good opportunity to continue to make important progress in the margin expansion arena.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Mark made a comment and it's again a little bit towards the last conversation about acquisition opportunities. Can you talk a little bit about what you'd be seeing there? Would that be in businesses that you're in, expanding it to new geographies, potentially entering new businesses and anything of scale? Would you feel comfortable executing on something of scale in this environment?", "John Luke", "Well, let me comment this way. With the important market-based strategic work we've had underway with the growth and with the progress we're achieving in the growth opportunities we see, we are, as you would expect, actively evaluating on a continuing basis a range of opportunities to grow in the markets that we have targeted, both here in North America as well as around the world, all of which offer very attractive, profitable growth prospects. I think as Mark Rajkowski indicated in his prepared comments, we have a bias towards smaller bolt-on tuck-in acquisitions. And as we look at those things, we can extend, stay ahead of the growth but participate in a manner that ensures that we are able to keep our eye first on providing the solutions that our customers value, thus ensuring that we keep our eye on expanding those margins that the first part of your question spoke to. And we are going to be very disciplined in how we do that. So it's less about scale than it is looking for ways in a disciplined and sustained fashion to capitalize on the very significant profitable growth opportunities that exist. With respect to the part of your question that dealt with would we move into new areas. One, it would certainly, we'd look hard at new geographies, the countries I mentioned earlier among others. And where the opportunities for a profitable participation, again, in the targeted end markets that we've reviewed with you, I'll point to potentials with other materials to round out the breadth of capabilities that we can bring to our customers. We will look at those as well. But our focus in packaging, you can be sure, will not stray from the end markets that we really worked to understand and where we see very significant growth potential.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Finally, just last question. As we're pushing year end and you're talking to customers, any read on what they're thinking about 2011? Any more appetite to invest in new products and what they're just in general thinking about the demand environment?", "John Luke", "I think what we're seeing is a recognition by our customers that one, there's great opportunity in emerging markets but that the developed portion of the world, Europe and North America in particular, are likely, for a variety of reasons, to be somewhat slow in growth over certainly in 2011 and perhaps beyond. So there's a bit of a balanced view that we're seeing with our customers. Nonetheless, what we are seeing is a recognition that investing in their brand is the most important way that they can insure that they are growing profitably and capturing that all-important share relative to their competition. So there is good investment in the brands and when that occurs, there is logical good investment in the importance of Packaging and Packaging Solutions to support those brands, and that's what we're focused on.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Just a couple of emerging markets questions. I wondered if you could provide us first with just a little bit of color on how the Chinese Converting business -- I think in Wuxi that you had put in, how that's progressing? And then secondly, it sounds like you're moving closer to a decision to expand the mill side of Rigesa, and I wondered if you could give us a sense of both what the timing might look like? And then just order of magnitude, what kind of scale you're anticipating down there? It seems to me over the last three or four years, you've already increased the sort of the back end of the mill and a lot of the ancillary support around the mill.", "John Luke", "First of all, I think with respect to China, the converting plant that we put in Wuxi is continuing to make progress. It's performing quite well. As you may know, we're producing both cartons at that facility, as well as fabricating pumps and dispensers for the home and garden, among other markets and that business is going well. With respect to Brazil, as we've talked through the year, we are moving closer to the end of the year and therefore, our timeline for evaluating a final decision for discussion with our board on what our recommendation are for a possible expansion in Brazil at the mill. As you noted, and I think you've seen, we have invested in recent years in the back end of the facility. So if we do decide to proceed with the expansion that we've talked about, the infrastructure, clearly, is very much in place to support that. But again, consistent with the timeline, we've said we would expect to be considering a decision on that certainly within the next several weeks to a couple of months.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Rick Skidmore with Goldman Sachs.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "First, can you give us the Media business LTM EBIT of the business that you sold?", "E. Rajkowski", "Yes, Rick. Maybe you could follow up off-line with Jason on that one.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Second question would be in the Land Management business. The revenues are showing on your press release is $26 million but the proceeds from land sales were $6 million. Can you just talk about what that $20 million difference is and why there wasn't any associated profit with that?", "E. Rajkowski", "Rick, there's a couple of pieces of that segment in terms of revenues, and one is related to land sales. The other relates to forestry activities, including the sale of wood for pulp and saw logs as well as some leasing and mineral rights. So that's the difference between the two.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And is there a reason that it looks like your reported EBIT in that segment was only a couple of million dollars, that there wasn't much margin in that or is the limited margin in the land that you sold?", "E. Rajkowski", "Yes, the margins on the forestry side leasing haven't really changed. I think the big change is just in the volume of transactions related to rural lands sales which were down, and as I've mentioned in my comments, are really just a function of timing. And certainly, market conditions are not as strong as they had once been.", "John Luke", "And I think along with that, as you reinforce purposeful discipline on our part with respect to the timing of proceeding with the transaction based on market conditions.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "One last question, just on the cash balance. Is there something structural that necessitates having such a significant cash balance that you've been carrying for the last few years? Or would you look to redeploy that cash in some way?", "James Buzzard", "Rick, when you go back to the last few years, certainly, we're coming out of a period that was pretty uncertain, and certainly, as we got through that, it made a heck of a lot of sense to be long on cash and to fortify our financial strength. As we move forward, as conditions stabilize and I think as we evidenced this past quarter, we are going to be looking at opportunities to deploy that cash in a very effective and balanced way. And we did buy back some stock, debt at opportunistic levels. We've continued to invest in our business for growth, both in the form of capital and G&A as we look to continue to develop and commercialize new products. Lastly, as I've mentioned in my comments and as John was talking earlier, we're going to continue to look for opportunities to grow our business with bolt-on acquisitions of very attractive businesses.", "John Luke", "I think Mark summed it up nicely. I think we see very good opportunities but we also see, as I commented, there's some uncertainties out there. I don't think that while we're seeing some stabilization in the economies of the world, that the worst is -- hopefully, the worst is behind us. But I think it's important to remain disciplined and maintain liquidity and I would daresay, as I look across industries today, that we're hardly alone in maintaining that. That said, we are very bullish about the progress we're making and the opportunities we see. And as opportunities really present themselves to grow meaningfully and profitably, the liquidity is certainly a very attractive source of funding for that growth.", "Operator", "The last question comes from the line of Peter Ruschmeier with Barclays Capital.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "On Slide 6, you show CNK prices down $5 year-on-year, and I was thinking that there were various price increases that would have had higher prices. Is that a mix issue or is it a contracts or something that you can help us with in terms of what to expect going forward?", "James Buzzard", "Really a mix issue, Pete.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "And do you have anything in the marketplace currently on CNK that would be leading to higher prices?", "James Buzzard", "We do have an announcement out there that we're working through the markets right now.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "And would you expect that to help as early as the fourth quarter or is that more of a 2011 benefit?", "James Buzzard", "We're still having ongoing conversations. I think we would expect to see some benefit in the fourth quarter but most of it in 2011.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "And then maybe a question for Mark, if I'm doing my math right, it looks a $212 million sequential decline in net debts between 2Q and 3Q. Can you help us with some of the cash items, the puts and takes? Obviously, the proceeds from the sale but some of the puts and takes that allowed that to happen?", "E. Rajkowski", "Yes. Starting at the top, we generated approximately $270 million of cash from operations. We used some of that cash to invest in CapEx. We used some of that cash -- I think that was roughly $60 million, paid our dividend of $40 million. And as I've mentioned earlier, we also used roughly $100 million to repay debt, another $16 million to buy back stocks. So we did generate roughly $70 million of proceeds from the sale of our Media business, and I think those are the big puts and takes in terms of cash flows and cash deployment.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "And within the $270 million cash from ops, can you help us within that, were there any items along the lines of timing of cash interest payments or the timing of cash tax payments that would impact that number?", "E. Rajkowski", "We did have some cash tax payments. We also had some cash tax refunds. But I think, none of those, on a net basis, were overly significant. I mean, if you want a detailed breakdown, we can take that off-line.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Just lastly, as I look at the Consumer Solutions performance, it looked like a very good quarter. It looked like part of that was the absence of the Media Packaging. So if I look sequentially, 350 basis points of margin improvements, how much of that was the absence of Media Packaging and how much of that was other factors?", "James Buzzard", "Pete, I think and it depends on the quarter because Media Packaging is a fairly cyclical business. But on average, the impact to Media was somewhere between 100 and 150 basis points on any one quarter. The rest of that improvement is really a function of continuing to drive an improved mix of products, growing with products that have higher margins and a continued focus on productivity and taking costs out of our operations.", "Operator", "And I'll turn the conference back over to Jason.", "Jason Thompson", "Thanks for joining us, and Roxanne, if you could please give out the replay information, that will be great.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be made available for a replay after 12:00 p.m. today running through November 27, 2010, at midnight.

[Operator Instructions] At this point, I'd like to turn the meeting over to Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Jason Thompson. Please go ahead.", "Jason Thompson", "Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced our results before the market opened, and a notification of this morning's call was broadly disclosed. Further, this morning's call is being webcast at mwv.com, and a slide that accompany this call are available there as well.", "I'll briefly remind you that certain statements we make are forward-looking, and are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties described in our public filings. Furthermore, contents contain time-sensitive information that although correct today may change with the passage of time.", "All the results we share this morning are presented on a continuing-operations basis. For the fourth quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $68 million or $0.40 per share, x items adjusted net income was $71 million or $0.41 per share. ", "Now here to tell you more about our results for the fourth quarter and the full year are John Luke, Chairman and CEO; Jim Buzzard, our President; and Mark Rajkowski, CFO. ", "I'll now turn the call over to John.", "John Luke", "Thanks, Jason, and good morning. I'm pleased to report that MWV completed a record year in 2010, with very strong performance in the fourth quarter. Our operating earnings for the year were due directly to the success we have had in implementing our market focus strategies for our Packaging businesses and an exceptionally strong performance in our Specialty Chemicals business. ", "Looking back at the year in which we made substantial and lasting progress with our business model improvement and market-based strategies, it is clear that we have transformed MWV's business.  Our vision has been and remains to be a global leader in packaging, competing successfully in the most profitable end markets, partnering with the best brands and customers, developing the most innovative solutions, and delivering the most value possible to our shareholders. Our steady record of progress in recent years confirms that MWV is capitalizing on these strengths to deliver significantly higher earnings on a consistent basis. ", "This transformation is especially evident in our performance in 2010. First, we shaped to more valuable revenue mix, exiting unattractive products and markets, and replacing this volume with higher margin products and solutions. Second, we partnered with global brand owners to understand their strategies and packaging requirements, and to develop solutions that enhance their market performance and expand their share. Third, we invented and commercialized innovative new solutions based on consumer insights, customer needs and MWV's design and technology capabilities. And fourth, we used our financial strength to invest in profitable growth opportunities in our most attractive markets. ", "The result is a substantial and sustainable improvement in profitability across our businesses that drove record operating income of $531 million, exclusive of special items. This success, a new starting point for further improvement, was built on our focused work to execute specific strategies to grow profitably in the large global packaging market that we have targeted. ", "As a logical extension of this, we are in the process of organizing our internal management structures to run our Packaging businesses with a focus on end markets. When we complete this process and operate in this structure, most likely later in 2011, we will report segment results under this new view. This will give our investors and other stakeholders a better perspective on the transformative changes we are implementing and the heightened potential for very strong growth and value creation in attractive end markets. ", "Until it's appropriate to report our results in this way, I will highlight key activity in our top-priority markets. After I do so today, Jim will share additional details on our performance in the segment as we report them today. Mark will follow with a review of our financial performance for the year, and provide an outlook for our business for the first quarter of 2011. ", "Turning to our targeted packaging markets and beginning with food. In the large global market for food packaging, we continue to win new business with retail food customers. Our volume was up about 12% in the quarter, especially with new product launches by frozen and dry food customers, including Kellogg's, Unilever and General Mills. We're also building our platform for future growth, with in-store trials for Captivate, our shopper-ready packaging solution for grocery store shelves, with major brand owners starting in the first quarter of 2011. ", "Our Beverage Packaging business was steady for the year, tracking at or slightly ahead of trends in the industry. There was widespread softness for beer and soft drink multipacks in developed markets in North America and Europe, but we achieved strong volume increases in Asia and Latin America. We've recently seen an increase in machinery placements, a sign that customers are beginning to make infrastructure investments that we expect will lead to higher revenue in the future. ", "In the Healthcare Packaging market, we lead the adherence category with our Shellpak and Dosepak products. And we're now launching a national rollout for Shellpak with Kroger, including marketing support, pharmacist training and in-store materials. Including our business with other retail customers and branded and generic drug companies, volume for our adherent solutions was up almost 25% for the year. ", "Scientifically proving that these packaging solutions positively influenced the way patients take their medications is an important strategic priority for our Healthcare business. We have recently completed two year-long scientific studies that strongly support our view that Shellpak can improve medication adherance. The result of these study will be published in peer-reviewed medical journals in the coming weeks and months, and we will use those to support the future marketing of our products. ", "We had continuing strong performance in the home and garden marketplace, with high demand for trigger sprayers, for surface cleansers and our aerosol dispensers for products like Febreze. Some consumers are beginning to trade up to the premier brands, and purchase a wider variety of specialized products. With the technologies and strategic global positions that we acquired from European trigger sprayer company, Spray Plast, during the fourth quarter we expect to continue our strong performance in this market in 2011 and well beyond. ", "In beauty and personal care, the higher-end portion of the market continues to rebound strongly. During the quarter, we had very good sales of our  airless dispensers and pumps for the fragrance markets. Demand for these products is strong around the world, especially in Asia. Balancing this during the period, however, we did see lower volumes in the fourth quarter for our mass-market soaps and sanitizer dispensers in North America due to diminished concerns about the H1N1 virus that drove exceptional volumes last year. ", "Lastly, we had very strong sales and earnings in Brazil during the quarter, with increased sales of corrugated packaging for produce, frozen meat and other markets served by Rigeza. During the fourth quarter, we also announced an investment to support expanded market growth in Brazil by building on our long-standing presence, deep market knowledge and fiber cost advantage, and that project is moving along on schedule.", "More importantly, the market reaction to our announcement has been very positive. Many of our customers are planning continued strong growth, and they are pleased to have a reliable partner like Rigesa to invest and grow with them. This very attractive investment will help maintain our position as a key supplier for their packaging needs. ", "Our ability to capitalize on clear opportunities for profitable growth in the attractive packaging markets I've just mentioned is the key factor in our improved performance, and will be a critical component of our value creation potential going forward. Together, these packaging end markets represent more than $300 billion in sales around the world, and each is growing at rate from 2% to 6% overall and as much as 10% to 12% in rapidly developing markets such as Brazil, India and across the rest of Asia. ", "We have advantages that we are exploiting to capture these profitable growth opportunities, and we also have the financial strength and market knowledge to invest in extending these advantages with both organic growth and additional acquisitions that fit our strategy in key markets.  With the business strategies we have in each of these targeted packaging markets and our other businesses, most particularly the step change we've made in our Specialty Chemicals business that Jim will describe in a moment, we are very confident in our ability to drive further earnings in cash flow improvement on a consistent basis. ", "With the transformative changes to our model taking hold across MWV, our entire company is focused on making these new strengths the hallmark of our business today and for many years to come, and enabling us to achieve the next level of performance that we have confidence will further set us apart from the competition. ", "I'll now turn it to Jim to report on our operational and segment performance. Jim?", "James Buzzard", "Thanks, John. MWV's performance in 2010 was a direct result of improvements to our business model and the impact of our profitable growth strategies in key targeted markets. ", "Overall, sales were up 5% for the year, with a solid performance in the fourth quarter adding to the success we established to the first nine months of 2010. Our reshaped product portfolio and participation strategies in packaging end markets continued to be the major driver of our improved results. Our expanded innovation capabilities also contributed greatly to the positive shift in our product mix. ", "In 2010, we enhanced our innovation capabilities with consumer insights and product design capabilities that have proven to be a key element of our partnerships with global customers. These partnerships lead to breakthrough new innovations, such as Captivate for the food market and airless dispensing solutions in personal care. In these cases, we have developed innovations that solve our customers' biggest challenges, and address their customers' biggest needs, whether they are standing out on a crowded grocery store shelf or getting that very last drop of product from a bottle of lotion. ", "In addition to the widespread commercial success we've achieved in our targeted markets, we operated well throughout the year, driving productivity improvements and cost reductions, and supporting our commercial team with an efficient and effective manufacturing system. We added another $16 million in savings from our strategic cost management program, which pushed us beyond our target of $250 million in run rate savings. We also delivered an additional 3% productivity for the year for our ongoing operational excellence program. ", "I'll now provide some details about the contributions from each of our business segments to this strong performance. Additional information is available on our press release, and the slides that accompany this call.  Three quarters of our revenue comes from Packaging, which combines our Packaging Resources and Consumer Solutions reporting segments. Together in the fourth quarter, the Packaging businesses increased profits by 54%,  and our EBIT margins improved almost 300 basis points. This demonstrates the strong trajectory of our largest and most important business. ", "In the Packaging Resources segment, sales were up 5% in the fourth quarter, with especially strong performance in markets for retail food packaging, liquid packaging and commercial print paperboard and in Rigesa. We also have significant pricing gains, a richer product mix and excellent productivity improvements throughout the system, which resulted in a 60% increase in segment profit during the fourth quarter. ", "Bleached board shipments were down 1.5% in the quarter. We lost some shipments due to the timing of export vessel shipping schedules, and we used a seasonally slower time to rebuild inventories to improve our service posture in key markets. Shipments of CNK were up 3%, reflecting continued gains in retail food packaging. We continue to run full at our mills during the quarter, and order backlogs remained at four to five weeks at the end of the quarter.", "The overall performance in the Packaging Resources segment for the year was very strong, with a $75 million improvement in earnings compared to 2009, in spite of significant weather-related impacts in the early part of 2010. This also includes a record year at Rigesa, where our investment to further grow the corrugated packaging business is proceeding on schedule. ", "In the Consumer Solutions segment, sales were down slightly in the fourth quarter and the year, as we've continued to exit some unprofitable business. However, we did have substantial volume growth for our value-added solutions and targeted markets, including airless and fragrance dispensing solution and personal care, trigger and hose-end sprays in home and garden, adherent solutions in healthcare, as well as broad-based growth in emerging markets. This richer product mix and productivity improvement for our manufacturing optimization actions in this business helped drive dramatic profit improvement in the Consumer Solutions segment, up 41% and 33% for the fourth quarter and the full year, respectively.", "In the Consumer and Office product segment, we had solid operating results for the fourth quarter, though total sales in the segment were down slightly compared to last year. While we experienced better than expected shipment volumes for calendars and time management products during the end-of-year season, they remained below last year's levels.  Also, volumes were down in Tilibra versus last year due to a shift in timing of the back-to-school season in Brazil. The segment continue to generate very strong productivity, which helped drive earnings up 4% to $57 million during the fourth quarter, and overcame inflation on key input costs that are expected to continue in 2011. ", "During the quarter, we entered into an agreement as to sell the segment's Envelope business, which is included in discontinued operations. We expect this transaction to close shortly.  In the Specialty Chemicals segment, we closed out a record year, with another very strong performance in the fourth quarter. We continue to see the same trends, growth around the world for our auto carbon solutions, asphalt and multipliers, including Evotherm and oil field chemicals. In many cases, we've created the markets for these chemical derivative products, and we've invested over the past few years to take advantage of global growth trends, especially in emerging markets like Brazil and China. ", "As a result, sales in the fourth quarter are 25% higher than last year and earnings more than doubled to $36 million during the quarter. Overall, the $141 million earnings in this segment for the year was a record result, and the team has built a strong foundation in the business to drive further improvement. ", "In Community Development and Land Management, we had good progress from our development activities and rural land sales during the fourth quarter. We continue to build this business by focusing on a disciplined approach to extracting the maximum value from our land holdings, with a special emphasis on the land we own in South Carolina. The Charleston South Carolina area, in particular, has one of the best economic development engines in the country, and many of our rural and industrial properties are positioned perfectly to capitalize on the strong prints favoring this region.  As evidence, we've already completed the first industrial warehouse as part of our joint venture with the Rockefeller Group in just over a year. The tenant, TBC Corporation, accepted the building upon completion and will be occupying this 1.1 million square-foot facility shortly.  Another two building path at this development site are ready, and we've had have an increasing share of inquiries from potential industrial tenants looking to capitalize on the economic developments in Charleston area, including the new Boeing assembly plant and the announcement of an expanded port terminal. ", "During the quarter, we also closed the sale of our first commercial property in our East Edisto project, with tremendous cooperation from county government.  Despite the strong business environment in South Carolina, the real estate market has not been immune to the impact of the recession. In these tough conditions, we still closed on a number of rural land sales during the fourth quarter in South Carolina and elsewhere, with an average price per acre of over $3,000.  The number of transactions has remained lower than prerecession levels, but the very strong valuations we received validate our direct marketing approach that leverages our land management knowledge and premium branding to find the right buyers for the right-priced properties in the right locations. ", "Now I'd like to turn the call to Mark to discuss some of our financial metrics for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2010. Mark?", "E. Rajkowski", "Thanks, Jim. By virtually every measure, our financial performance during 2010 was outstanding. We generated record earnings, and we grew our revenues by 5% for the year. Additional highlights of our 2010 performance include record operating profit of $531 million, free cash flow of over $115 million, and that's cash after CapEx and dividends, and a 9% increase in our annual dividend to $1 per share. ", "Our improved business model and earnings momentum in 2010 give us confidence that we can continue to deliver performance improvements in 2011. Our businesses are performing exceptionally well in today's still-challenging economic environment, and we have opportunities to extend our success with new investments and profitable growth strategies in our targeted end markets. ", "We have shaped a more valuable product mix across our businesses. We are profitably growing in our targeted markets, and we have an efficient delivery platform that is bringing more of our top line gain to the bottom line. In short, the transformation of our company has put us on solid ground to deliver consistently higher earnings and financial returns for our shareholders. ", "I'll now provide some more detail on the improvements in our financial performance, and then share our outlook for each of the business segments in the first quarter.  Our focus on higher value products and customers resulted in significant price and mix contribution to our top and bottom line in the quarter and for the full year, especially in our Consumer Packaging and Specialty Chemicals businesses. Excluding deliberate product line exits, volume of our core products was up 5% for the year and down 1% during the fourth quarter. Volume growth for the year was driven by increases in food and liquid packaging, airless dispensers for personal care products, trigger sprayers for the home and garden markets, corrugated packaging in Rigesa and by strong volume increases in our Specialty Chemicals businesses. ", "In the fourth quarter, continued volume growth in these areas was offset by lower beverage volumes in line with beer and soft drink declines in developed markets, lower volumes of personal care pumps for soap and hand sanitizers compared to last year's heightened concern about H1N1 epidemic and a shift in volume for Tilibra from a later back-to-school season in Brazil. Our growth in 2010 was driven by our focus on value added new products, as well as the leading positions we've established in rapidly developing markets such as Brazil, India and other areas in Asia Pacific. Sales growth in these markets was about 15% in 2010 paced by our record performance in Rigesa, and continued strong demand for asphalt and automotive carbon solutions in Asia. ", "Our business in emerging markets now represents more than $1.5 billion in annual sales or 27% of our total revenue. Importantly, we are now leveraging our commercial momentum over a much improved cost structure. This combination resulted in significant expansion of our operating margins in both the quarter and full year and a record $531 million of adjusted EBIT. The strength of our transformed business can also be seen in our balance sheet and in our cash performance. Stronger earnings and continued gains in asset efficiency were the primary drivers of our excellent operating cash flow performance at about $550 million in 2010. During the year, we improved our cash-to-cash cycle by an additional five days. ", "We are allocating capital in a manner that is most productive for our shareholders. The increase in our annual dividend to $1 a share is a reflection of the higher levels of cash flows we're generating from our business today and the confidence that we have in our ability to continue to improve our cash flows going forward. We'll do that by continuing to invest in profitable growth opportunities that we've identified in each of our businesses. Our expansion in Brazil and the acquisition of Spray Plast for our global Home and Garden business are recent examples. ", "Beyond these, we are increasing investment in our new product pipeline and are continuing to look for further bolt-on opportunities that can augment our capabilities or strengthen our presence in global growth markets.  In addition to making growth investments in 2010, we returned $250 million to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. We also repaid $132 million of long-term debt, resulting in a debt-to-capital ratio of 38% at year end. ", "Now turning to our outlook. Our improved margin profile, cash generation and increased commitments to shareholders underscore the progress that we've made with our transformed business. As we look into 2011, we expect another solid year of overall earnings improvement.  Demand across our targeted packaging markets has stabilized and in some cases, is improving. And we continue to see good demand around the world for our Pine Chemicals and carbon solutions. We are, however, closely watching the recent price trends for oil and the impact on our energy, raw materials and freight cost. Prolonged spikes in oil prices would not only impact our short-term profitability, but could also slow demand recovery. ", "Now a quick rundown of our first quarter outlook for each of our segments. In the Packaging Resources Group, we expect segment profits to be well above year-ago levels. Order backlogs are above normal seasonal levels and will have a benefit from pricing actions taken in 2010. In addition, we are better positioned to address potential fiber availability challenges caused by weather, which was a drag on segment profits during the first quarter last year. ", "In Consumer Solutions, we expect segment profits to be similar to year-ago levels. Higher volumes in our home and garden business and from Spray Plast acquisition, price and mix improvement and continued productivity gains are expected to be largely offset by higher cost for materials and freight and continued weakness in 2cc pumps for soaps and sanitizers due to lower H1N1 concerns. ", "Our Consumer and Office Products business is expected to post a modest first-quarter profit. Shipments of dated products into the commercial channel have been solid, and some sales for Tilibra have shifted into the first quarter, as the school year in Brazil is beginning later due to the timing of carnival. Higher paper costs, however, will somewhat offset these benefits. ", "The business model improvements we drove in 2010 in our Specialty Chemicals business will continue in 2011. In the first quarter, segment profits will be well above year ago levels, with comparisons getting tougher thereafter. We expect relatively solid demand for Performance Chemicals aimed at global energy and infrastructure markets, as well as steady demand for automotive carbon. ", "In our Community Development and Land Management business, market conditions for rural land sales remained challenging, making it difficult to forecast sales and earnings. However, there has been an increase in inquiries for both rural and industrial properties, and we are continuing with our approach to marketing that we expect will continue to generate premiums values per acre. ", "With that, I'll turn it back to John.", "John Luke", "Mark, thanks very much. To summarize MWV's performance during the fourth quarter was a solid finish to a very strong year. Our financial performance directly reflects the hard work across our organization to strengthen our business model and increase our profitability in targeted global growth markets. The transformation of our business is not an end point, but instead is a new baseline on which to build further. We're always looking ahead, and we're enthusiastic about the substantial opportunities that we see and expect to further improve our performance by capitalizing on the commercial and operational strengths that we have built. ", "With this, we'll conclude our prepared remarks and turn to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "You highlight some good things happening in the land segment, but we still worry that this is going to take forever to happen. Can you give us a little sense of your timeline, and whether you plan to take projects into construction or whether you're going to be done when you get to the end of entitlement? Just trying to get a sense of what kind of light there is light at the end of the tunnel.", "John Luke", "Mark this is very much a work in progress and one that is taking shape that we're very excited about. We certainly see, particularly against the backdrop of what has happened in the economic environment, very, very significant progress, whether it is the entitlement work that we expect to move along at good pace, as well as the development or planning for development of another series of projects in and around that low-country area, and Mark referenced some of the early successes we're having with that work. We clearly see this as something that can create significant value. We don't see this as something that's going to take a long, long time, but we see it as something that will generate a steady stream of value creation for our shareholders. We'll keep you closely informed. And frankly, we hope to have a visit for a series of investors to come down and see what we're doing firsthand sometime the middle of this year.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "On the Consumer Solutions business, you clearly have gotten a lot done in terms of productivity, you're cleaning up the mix.  Can you give us a sense of how strong you feel the top line story is there? I mean, you alluded to 3% and 6% and 10% in emerging markets. Do you need to see more acquisitions there to get the top line moving, John?", "John Luke", "Mark, I think there are two answers to the questions. One, we're very excited about the opportunity organically to expand the top line, leveraging the innovations that we have, and what we referred to as against the backdrop of what has been and expected to be in North America and other developed parts of the world relatively slow growth. But you contrast that with the opportunities we see in markets that we've highlighted like Brazil, China and certainly, India among others, the opportunity in those areas for much more robust participation with the products and solutions that are part of our competitive suite right now are pretty significant. To your point about acquisitions, we certainly, just as we acquired Spray Plast in Europe to get technology and expanded market position, and will further build our strategy across Eastern Europe, we see a significant opportunity for similar kinds of bolt-ons, if you will, to be explored that will further bolster our participation in present markets and potentially adjacent markets, and perhaps even with new materials that enhance our capability as a packaging solution provider. So I think there are two answers, as I said, just to recap, one, very good opportunity continuing to do what we're doing given the growth trends. But second, with our eyes wide-open, opportunities to be very opportunistic to profitably expand our business in those regions with attractive bolt-ons.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Credit Suisse.", "Chip Dillon - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Can you give us a sort of a rough estimate of what you have, sort of how you see the CapEx flowing in '11 and even in '12, taking into the Rigesa project, just order of magnitude?", "E. Rajkowski", "Chip, one of the things that we've talked about in over the last 12 to 18 months is certainly our focus on continuing to look for opportunities to invest in profitable growth. We weren't going to get ahead of the curve in terms of the economy. We are seeing some stability in the global economy. We do have some opportunities that we think are very attractive in a number of our end markets and as well as emerging markets that would suggest that our capital spend in 2011 will be at slightly higher levels beyond what we're also going to be investing in for the expansion of our Brazil business. So this year, we came in at roughly $250 million. Next year in addition to our LEGO expansion, we expect to see capital closer to $300 million, because we think there's some real good opportunities to profitably grow the business.", "Chip Dillon - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "So for '11, when you add them both together, what would that all total with Brazil?", "E. Rajkowski", "Brazil, next year will probably going to be slightly north of $300 million in terms of CapEx. And then on top of that, we'd have what I would view as more of our core capital spend, which I mentioned, is probably going to be in the neighborhood of $300 million.", "Chip Dillon - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And that's for '11?", "E. Rajkowski", "That's correct, Chip.", "Chip Dillon - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "I guess with that, then it would be less in '12 -- I don't remember the exact number. But would '12 be a little bit less than that or in other words, is the bulk of Rigesa happening in '11?", "E. Rajkowski", "Yes, it is. Approximately 2/3 of our capital spend will hit in '11, the remainder in the first part of '12. So you will see a declining level of CapEx in 2012.", "John Luke", "Chip, It's John. I would just pick up on what Mark has said and reinforce the profitable growth dimension of the investments we're making. As we've talked about the Rigesa project, it is one that is clearly one that we're excited about. But we're excited not only because of the growth potential, but we're particularly excited because a good discipline was put in place, and it will support true profitable growth, and this is something that as we see CapEx, whether it's for a special project like Brazil or other things move up and down from year-to-year, you can be sure that everything has been put through the rigorous discipline of a profitable growth assessment.", "Chip Dillon - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And then just real quickly, could you just talk a little bit more about the land around East Edisto. It would seem, I mean, from the concept of you guys, I would think, would be active, and maybe helping to recruit business down there. It's a very business-friendly area, obviously, with Boeing not far away, and yet a lot can determine the future value of that land based on how the  suburbanization of Charleston continues. Are there actually activities where you're involved with local officials to attract businesses and others to that area?", "John Luke", "Chip, the short answer is that when we are invited by the leadership in the community, of which we're increasingly a part, to engage in those activities we do so with great enthusiasm. The state and the local region, including the City of Charleston, has outstanding commercially focused economically developed leadership. And I think what they have been able to do in the last couple of years by attracting Boeing and other companies is a reflection of their vision. And we have, as a key member of the community and working closely with them on development plans both for ours, as well as looking at overall plans for the region, have an opportunity to participate in formal and informal ways we have done so enthusiastically.", "Operator", "And we now have a question from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "To review what you're looking at in terms of the operating segments. Would you envision that potentially leading to further restructuring activity or portfolio changes?", "John Luke", "As we are going through this evaluation, we would not anticipate that there would be major restructuring. I think the kinds of changes that have involved restructuring or portfolio changes have largely been addressed through our activities over the last couple of years. It is with all of that now, at least for the present, largely behind us, that we are now looking at how we can and should be managing the business more effectively to support our strategies.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "And in terms of mill pricing, can you give a little bit more color on the comment you made about currency benefits in 2010? And also, can you talk maybe little bit about what you're seeing down in Brazil in terms of pricing as well? There is some talk on recycled board prices weakening a little bit, just wondering what you're seeing?", "John Luke", "Jim, you want to offer some thoughts there?", "E. Rajkowski", "Gail, in terms of mill pricing, we have, throughout the year, have been moving up pricing on the SBS side. because I think, as we referenced in this slide, up 8% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We moved CNK pricing early in 2011, and seen good success implementing that. Down in Brazil, in the corrugated market, we had very strong pricing activity in the second half of the year, and that's partially led to the improved performance down there.", "John Luke", "Gail, it's John. I would just add on to what Jim has said that, I think, we have done a very good job addressing our pricing everywhere we can. The pricing is supported by a real focus on the value and performance characteristics that our products bring to our customers. And in his comments on the outlook, Mark mentioned the potential for inflationary pressures, potentially largely driven by what we see underway in the oil market right now and beyond just value-based pricing that we would normally look to. You can be sure that we are vigilant and looking to anticipate cost increases that might potentially need to be offset by pricing. We see those risks coming, and we have very determined plans to ensure that wherever and whenever we can, we will pass those through and enhance pricing.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Down in Brazil, that strong pricing is holding currently?", "E. Rajkowski", "Yes, it is.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "And can you just talk. I mean, it sounds like your tone is maybe a little bit more optimistic than it has been in terms of market outlook, and just wondering if you can give a little more color on what your hearing from your customers, any signs that they're willing to invest in new products, that they're getting confident that demand will come back a little bit stronger in 2011?", "John Luke", "It's John. Let me just offer a few high-level thoughts and invite others to jump in. We are standing, perhaps, a bit more optimistic, because we have had a very good year in setting the stage for future growth. Yes, we have seen more stabilization in North America, and we hope in Europe, and that would be welcomed. But I don't know that we are overly optimistic about the pace and tone of rebound in the developed market. That said, our optimism underscores our confidence in the positions we have developed in those developed markets and the opportunities that we see to participate in the very significant profitable growth opportunities in our targeted markets in what is broadly called the emerging markets.", "Operator", "And we'll move on to the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group", "In the fourth quarter, the operating performance was obviously good, especially relative to at least my expectations in the Chemicals business, the improvement. It got a little bit offset, it seemed though, by some other expenses both on corporate, there's was an $11 million other and also, there seems to be some strategic cost management spending. Can you help us understand those drivers, on the corporate and the other and the strategic, and where they're likely to be going in 2011?", "John Luke", "Let me take that one. Just taking a step back when you look at the work that we've done over the last 18 months relative to our overhead cost structure, I think it's clear that it's having its intended effect. When you look at SG&A costs in total dollars or as a percentage of sales, they're down 90 basis points as a percentage of sales, both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. When you look at just our total corporate spend that you referenced, our spending is down year-over-year for the full year. There was a little bit of a tick-up in the second half of the year, and that's largely a function of accruals related to incentive comps, some spending on projects, primarily IT-related. But the trend on an all-in basis for the year is positive, and we'd expect that to continue. So as we look at 2011, we wouldn't expect to see that run rate that you saw in Q4 to be $74 million. A lot of that is just related to some accruals and year-end things that I mentioned. Our run rate, as we head into 2011, would be close to $60 million.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group", "And there is an $11 million as well. Was that kind of a one-off, or what was that $11 million?", "John Luke", "$11 million related to -- which component are you talking about? In other? Yes, again, there's a couple of items in there. One is we've got some legal and environmental accruals in there. We made a contribution to our foundation. Those are the big drivers.", "Operator", "And we now have a question from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "That's a really impressive performance over in Specialty Chemicals. I wondered if you could just give us some thoughts on whether there is room for further margin improvement there, and also what you might be thinking about in terms of ways to further expand that business.", "John Luke", "Mark, it's John. Let me just offer a couple of comments, and hand it over to Jim. I think I would just -- with an element of pride for the folks who run and toil in that business day in and day out, echo your thoughts. They have done a very good job, and as I commented in my prepared remarks, what we're seeing there is a step change in the quality and character performance in that business that reflects several years of very hard work in setting new strategies, both to participate more broadly in traditional markets, as well as to participate attractively in a growth that we're seeing in all of our businesses in the emerging markets as well. So step change is the operative term, and we do see good opportunities for building on that. Jim?", "James Buzzard", "Mark, three of the key drivers for this year in that business have been the focus we've had on innovation and the development of new products. I talked a little bit in my prepared comments about the move into new markets, particularly oil fields and building on our strong presence in the asphalt markets and productivity, and we see opportunities in all three areas. Over the last several years, we've made investments in China and Brazil, still have opportunities to grow in those important regions. And there is the last areas, where we clearly have not snapped back in the Auto Carbon business, nearly where we have been and we see opportunity for further growth in North America as those businesses come back. So echoing John's, well, I think the team just did an absolutely terrific job this past year, and we obviously believe it's a very sustainable performance, and one that we will build off of going forward.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Jim, I want to just step over to the Mill business for a minute. First of all, with CNK, is there a reason that pricing would be just flat year-to-year, because it seems like the recycled board market is going up. The SBS market is going up. I'm kind of puzzled why this third substrate would be flat from a pricing standpoint.", "James Buzzard", "Mark, the impact of mix that goes into that, and so we have some price movement that was offset by mix year-over-year.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "And you mentioned that you have price increase going in the first quarter of 2011. Can you give us just some sense of magnitude and what the timing is likely to be as it rolls in?", "James Buzzard", "We announced a $40 ton price increase, and we see that moving through very well. And we would expect to have it certainly fully in place by the end of the quarter, in the first quarter.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Over on SBS prices, I think you also mentioned that we're going to see some improvement there in the first quarter. I don't know about kind of further improvement for the year, but can you give us some sense of that as well, Jim?", "James Buzzard", "Mark, what we have in place in the first quarter is certainly moving on some contracts that will go up at the beginning of the year. Those are fully in place. And in terms of further opportunities, as John said, we will continue to value-price our product, and keep a sharp eye on potential inflation issues and you can be assured that we are watching it very closely.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "I've been talking to some consumer goods companies that are actually concerned about SBS supply over the next 12 to 18 months. I just wonder, is there capacity from the machines that you've idled at either Covington or down at Evadale that could potentially come back?", "James Buzzard", "No, sir, they won't come back.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "If we go back over the last 10 years, part of the strategy that you put in place about 10 years ago, was to kind of move away from Mill business a bit and focus more on downstream converting. And I wonder just given the leverage that we're seeing in the Mill business and given how the Mill business has improved with sort of the industry move and with the weaker dollar, whether you might rethink that strategy a little bit and come back and think about doing more things in Mill-related businesses beyond Brazil?", "John Luke", "Mark, let me pick that up. I think Brazil is very much the center of our focus right now for all of the reasons that we've talked about. I think you're right to raise the question. We did make a move and we've learned a lot. And it is the move downstream has helped shape what we are now excitedly pursuing as our profitable growth opportunity in packaging, that as we transition our management structure, we'll be focusing on an even more targeted way in discussing with you. I think over the same period, one of the things that we've been able to do to, in your words, leverage the mill capabilities is, as Jim alluded, really look to align the production of the mills with the quality and capabilities in both in performance and products to participate profitably in those targeted end markets in an ever more meaningful way. So our aim strategically is to grow profitably, and do it wherever and whenever we can align our current asset mix, and where there's an opportunity or need for further market growth. To add to that, we'll determine the most efficient way to pursue that course. And obviously, that answer is, of course, with the expansion in Brazil right now. Jim?", "James Buzzard", "And Mark, we share your belief that there is growth in these markets going forward, and we clearly, we know the leverage that exist in these operations, if there are targeted capital investments to allow us to increase our supply, we'll look at those.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "You're doing all this stuff in Brazil now, but are there any plans if we look a few years out to kind of expand in Latin America beyond just the Brazil base?", "James Buzzard", "Mark, we always have had an eye on what is happening in markets all around Latin America. I think one of the things that we have been able to do over the year is to, one, recognize that from Brazil, from both the Mills as well as our Converting operations, we can serve other countries and do it efficiently. We are doing a fair amount of work in Argentina at present, leveraging our Brazil platform. As we see economies hopefully follow Brazil forward, our knowledge of that part of the world may yet lead to other opportunities. But right now, we've got plenty of exciting growth potential right before us in Brazil.", "Operator", "And we'll move on to the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "George Staphos", "First, I want to piggyback on Mark's question, what mix factor actually was at work in terms of why CNK pricing wasn't up more or was flat in the quarter?", "E. Rajkowski", "The mix between, certainly, between Europe and North America, between our open markets, on the beverage side of the business, and between the non-beverage business, so all of those factors came into play.", "George Staphos", "Jim, could you give us some direction in terms of which of what you just enumerated went one way versus the other, if that's possible?", "James Buzzard", "Throughout the year, George, we saw even the sort of beverage business was flat. We had more growth in some of the non-beverage applications. And then our European business was down year-over-year. So that combination of those things lead to more of a flat model and pricing.", "George Staphos", "Would that suggest some of the new applications are lower in mix since they were growing?", "James Buzzard", "Well, in some cases, they may be. But in general, I think as we look going forward, we see our pricing moving up.", "George Staphos", "And Consumer Solutions, and again, we appreciate all the progress you've been making there in realigning the mix of business and the markets that you're in. You mentioned, I think, that volume was down in the quarter, some of that was H1N1, some of that was beverage. Was there any leakage in any other markets that you participate within in Consumer Solutions that we should be mindful of? And then the related question there, margins, nice improvement, year-on-year. But on a percentage basis, it's still relatively low on an EBITDA basis versus other Specialty Packaging businesses. So structurally, what you need to do to see better margins, say, closer to 10% over time in that business?", "John Luke", "Well, that certainly is a name that we have before us, George, I think to your first question, if there were leakage in other areas, we would have highlighted it. I think we're not seeing the growth in the volume in certain of those other areas that we would see going forward, but we're gotten our focus on the market right. We have done a better job in getting established in more of the emerging markets that we've talked a lot about here, as well as repositioning some of our converting businesses down in Brazil to serve those markets. We will continue to focus on profitably extending our participation strategies, and we are also continually leading, and Jim is leading this effort, and overall, continuing to review on our operating productivity in each of our supporting plants and factories here and around the globe. Jim, anything you want to add?", "James Buzzard", "George, I think what we've said before, we like the markets we're participating in. We clearly have seen very strong performance in our airless technology in the fragrance markets. Beverage was a little softer this year than we would've liked, but we see that coming back in 2011. So we think we are well-positioned in the combination of the ability to grow. And as John referenced, our ability to drive ongoing productivity will help us to expand those margins as we move forward.", "George Staphos", "And in fairness, there really hasn't been a specialty packaging company that's reported yet. So you're the first one out the door here. We'll see what the other companies report the next couple of weeks.", "John Luke", "George, I want to add, regardless of what they report, I think you put the bogey out there, and that we're going to keep moving towards that. And it's something else I would reference, is that we see very significant opportunity, as I touched on in my prepared remarks, in packaging for healthcare. That is also going to be a significant contributor going forward, and we're very excited about that.", "George Staphos", "In Specialty Chemicals, you've done a terrific job through innovation of ratcheting up price mix as one of the biggest drivers of your EBIT improvement this year. How do you build a moat around that price mix such that competitors who see the results that you're putting up don't try to encroach upon your markets? What's the barrier to entry for them relative to your market. And in Consumer & Office, you did a great job again on productivity. Can you size for us how much more opportunity you have for productivity in that business?", "James Buzzard", "George, I think in terms of the Specialty Chemicals business, the reason the price mix moves as it has is the value that we create in the marketplace for our customers, and that value is really based upon the technology that we provide. And we can quantify that, and our customer base fully understands that. So that really is the moat, as you referenced, that we are very confident we can put around that business. In terms of Consumer & Office products, they delivered good productivity this year. As John referenced, we have an ongoing program in all of our factories. And we expect them to continue to drive productivity through the programs we've got implemented to date. That's certainly something we will continue to focus on year in and year out.", "Operator", "And we have time for just one more question, and that'll come from the line of Rick Skidmore with Goldman Sachs.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "I wanted to ask, as you've made some changes in the overall business, i.e., exiting Media and Envelope, does that reflect a change in the overall thinking about the assets in the portfolio and your strategy for the businesses going forward and your directions specifically focused on becoming more of a packaging company, or is that just restructuring and exiting some underperforming businesses?", "John Luke", "I think it's much more the latter. I think that it clearly does, will reflect that we're actively looking at what is performing well, what the profitable growth trends are, and whether we should be thinking more broadly. But I think that unless Jim and Mark offer a different thought, which I'm sure they would if they had one, we are very aligned on the fact that our portfolio, as it stands now, is one that we're enthused about, and very committed to being a critical component in total to the next level of performance that we talked about.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And then just on that same topic, a few years ago, you talked about looking into what the appropriate vehicle was for the Land Management business, and then we had the downturn, any update on your thinking there? Does the Land business fit into the same comments you just made about the mix of the portfolio? Or is there thinking that's new on unlocking the value that's ultimately in that Land business a little quicker than sort of letting it play out through the development process?", "John Luke", "We are very excited about the work that is underway, as I commented earlier, and we are creating value in that business with the excellent leadership and team that's been assembled as we speak. And that I think will give us great opportunity to evaluate just what the future strategy for that business should be when the markets are such that it's appropriate to consider. But we are very committed to that business, and supporting its profitable growth.", "Jason Thompson", "Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us. We look forward to speaking with you throughout the quarter. Take care.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be made available for replay after 12:00 p.m. today through February 26 at midnight.

Rajkowski - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President", "James Buzzard - President", "John Luke - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Executive Committee", "Jason Thompson - Director of Investor Relations", "Analysts", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Phil Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (NYSE:USA) Inc.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "George Staphos", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for standing by, and welcome to the MeadWestvaco Second Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And also, as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Jason Thompson. Please go ahead.", "Jason Thompson", "Thank you, Perky, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced our results before the market opened. The notification of this morning's call was broadly disclosed. And further, this morning's call is being webcast at mwv.com. Slides that accompany this call are available there as well. I'll briefly remind you that certain statements we make are forward looking and are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties described in our public filings. Furthermore, contents contain time-sensitive information that, although correct today, may change with the passage of time.", "All the results we show this morning are presented on a continuing operations basis. For the second quarter, we reported income from continuing operations of $89 million or $0.51 per share. Excluding special items, adjusted income from continuing operations was $94 million or $0.54 per share. Now here to tell you more of our results of second quarter are John Luke, Chairman and CEO; Jim Buzzard, our President; and Mark Rajkowski, CFO. I'll now turn the call over to John.", "John Luke", "Thanks, Jason, and good morning. MWV delivered another solid performance during the second quarter. We are consistently generating higher sales and earnings by executing market-focused strategies that have given us a strong product and geographic mix in each of our businesses. As we entered 2011, we expected there to be some challenges in the global economy, including uneven consumer demand in developed markets and higher cost for some materials, and we planned for these external realities. Even as these challenges began to emerge in the second quarter, we delivered solid results. Our revenue increased by 9% and we generated record second quarter adjusted income from continuing operations of $94 million or $0.54 per share, a 40% improvement compared to last year. Specifically, we made gains during the quarter through an emphasis on value-based pricing and growing our business with key global customers. We also continued to see a beneficial impact from the leading positions we've built in fast-growing regions such as China and Brazil. ", "Sales across emerging markets grew by 22% in the quarter. Our success in these and other areas had a clear and positive impact on our performance. With these strong results, we continue to demonstrate that the step change in our performance is sustainable. And we are positioned to grow beyond these levels by further leveraging both the earning power of our business model and market participation strategies in each of our segments. That includes the significant value creation opportunities and upside potential that we see in our Land Management and Specialty Chemicals businesses, where we're continuing to see excellent progress. ", "We'd like to thank those of you who participated in our Investor Day, highlighting these 2 value drivers for our company. I think you will see that our performance during the second quarter was in line or exceeded the expectations we set out in that presentation, with CDLM marking a few key derisking milestones on important development projects and Specialty Chemicals having another record quarter of sales and earnings growth as it makes continuing progress implementing its business strategy. ", "We also had very good results in the end markets we serve with our 2 packaging segments, Packaging Resources and Consumer Solutions. Combined sales in food, beverage, healthcare, personal care, home and garden, tobacco markets were up $75 million or 9%. As we've discussed on other occasions, we are increasingly looking at our performance through the lense of our progress in these end markets. And we'll share more of these detail when we complete the transition to our new segment-reporting structure later this year. ", "Our biggest gains during the quarter were in the large global packaging market for food.  We have extended contracts with large brand owners such as Kellogg's, General Mills and Schwan for retail food packaging and we're working towards commercialization of innovative products, including packaging for salty and oily snacks and a shopper-ready packaging solutions for store shelves that will be part of our growth platform going forward. Recently, one of our designs, a new snack package for cookies and crackers called Evertain won best packaging concept at Kraft Foods' innovation day contest. ", "In beverage, while there've been some volume challenges due to consumption trends in Europe and North America, we're excited about the growth opportunities we've identified in both emerging, as well as developed markets. During the quarter, for instance, we placed a number of new beverage packaging machines with Coca-Cola, Danone and others that will lead to increased revenue growth in the future. ", "In healthcare, we recently released data from a significant study that validates the adherence-enhancing characteristics of our Shellpak product, proving that packaging alone positively impacts the way patients take medication. This is a breakthrough finding that addresses one of the very important challenges in the healthcare market. We believe that our growth opportunities with new and existing customers are better than ever based on this data, and we've already won new business for Shellpak with one of the India's largest pharmaceutical companies. Beyond adherence packaging, we're also becoming a proven supplier of pumps for the healthcare market. Sales were up more than 20% in our medical pumps business as we gain share from established competitors. ", "In the beauty and personal care market, the demand for luxury and masstige products such as perfume and skin care continues to be strong in Europe, despite lower overall discretionary spending. Our fragrance pumps and airless dispensers are doing very well in Europe and we have augmented that success with new wins in India during the quarter. ", "The home and garden market was very difficult during the all-important spring lawn and garden season because of bad weather patterns in North America. Our business with customers such as Scotts Miracle-Gro was down compared to a banner season last year. However, we grew in the home cleaning portion of the business in Europe and Asia, in part due to share gains we are winning with the recently acquired Spray Plast platform of trigger sprayers. ", "In Brazil, the economy's been going through a natural cycle of slower growth compared to the peak last year, which was the highest growth in more than 2 decades. Markets for Rigesa's corrugated packaging are in line with our expectations, softer in the southeastern region in Brazil that include Sao Paolo and Rio, but more resilient in the faster-growing northeastern region. During the quarter, we began operations of the new corrugated packaging plant in Aracatuba and we're enthusiastic about the pace of growing orders as we ramp up this new facility. Our long-term outlook for all of these packaging markets continues to be very positive, and we've generated a great deal of momentum by focusing our participation in these growing consumer product categories, momentum that has translated into better results over the past several quarters and positions us for excellent profitable growth going forward. ", "Before turning to Jim, let me summarize by saying that we are gratified by our continuing progress and have confidence that we can continue to successfully execute our strategies, strategies that offer significant promise for our shareholders. We recognize that economic uncertainties exist both here and around the world. And while not immune to these uncertainties, we'll be prepared to respond to challenges that may come our way. I'll now turn to Jim for a report on our operational and segment performance. Jim?", "James Buzzard", "Thanks, John. The results from our businesses during the quarter were very good. We had combined segment earnings of $231 million, a record for the second quarter. Our 9% sales growth was driven by value-based pricing initiatives across our businesses and by the impact of foreign currency exchange from sales in Europe and Brazil. Our successful price increases reflect the improved market participation strategies and are an important part of our effort to grow the business and stay ahead of input cost inflation. ", "I'll now provide some details about the contributions from each of our segments to this performance. Additional information is available in our press release and the slides that accompany this call. ", "In the Packaging Resources segment, sales were up 10% in the second quarter as we continue to generate strong pricing for our value-added products. Our business is especially strong in global food markets, with both pricing and significant volume increases during the quarter for food service paperboard, retail food packaging in Europe and Asia and liquid packaging in China, as well as market share gains in North American food markets. Pricing was also strong for beverage and tobacco paperboard while volumes were in line with overall consumption trends in these markets. Overall, shipment volume for bleached paperboard was higher compared to the second quarter last year while Coated Natural Kraft was down on the same basis. ", "And in Brazil, pricing for Rigesa's corrugated packaging continue to be very strong, reflecting the value of our differentiated offering in this market. But consistent with John's comments about the economy in Brazil compared to record growth last year, we had somewhat lower year-over-year volumes for corrugated packaging for many of the end markets we serve. We continue to be very positive about these markets in Brazil, and the investment in our corrugated packaging business there remains on track. The aggressive schedule we have established will have a new paperboard machine starting up by the middle of 2012. ", "Earnings in the Packaging Resources segment were nearly $100 million during the second quarter, up about 40% compared to last year. The improvement is primarily due to the pricing momentum and product mix improvements we've been able to drive in each of our markets, as well as increased manufacturing productivity at our facilities. ", "In the Consumer Solutions segment, revenue increased by 4% during the quarter, with a large portion of the increase coming from the foreign exchange impact of our sales in Europe and emerging markets. Pricing and product mix improvement also contributed to increased sales and were higher across almost all of our end markets. However, we did not see the kind of volume growth we expect in this segment. ", "Volumes were mainly impacted by beverage, where trends were in line with ongoing challenges in North American markets. We are partnering with our soft drink and beer customers to help them develop new solutions that will accelerate growth outside North America, especially in emerging markets. An example is our new beverage packaging machine that can be tailored to economically meet the specific multipack opportunities for small sizes and limited runs in places like China. More broadly, we had 14 new machine replacements around the world, outpacing the rate we saw last year and leaning to higher cart and volume for both new and established customers. ", "We did see volume trends during the quarter improve month-to-month for both personal care and healthcare packaging. Shellpak sales are trending higher as we add new drugs and customers, including increased business from Wal-Mart as they ramp up a new drug in their pipeline. And while our volume of dispensers for hand sanitizers and lotions are still below the high water mark during the peak of the H1N1 virus, we have seen improving sales in each of the last several months, which has added to the strong growth we continue to see in fragrance and airless dispensing solutions for the personal care market. ", "Earnings in Consumer Solutions were 5% lower than during the second quarter last year, principally due to the ongoing impact of higher resin costs. Resin costs flattened out at the end of the second quarter but remained well above last year's levels. We are recouping this inflationary costs with price increases, but the lag between contractual price increases and resin cost increases continues to negatively impact operating earnings. ", "In the Consumer & Office Products Segment, sales and earnings growth in the quarter were above our expectations. The shipment season for back-to-school in North America falls during the second and third quarters. And this year, we benefited from earlier sell-in of both branded consumer and time management products. Tilibra, our school supplies business in Brazil, also worked proactively with major customers to have a more consistent supply of products, which led to higher sell-in of consumer products compared to last year. Along with this shift of sales volume and product mix improvement, productivity gains also contributed to segment earnings performance. As the back-to-school season begins at retailers across North America, we are well positioned with major customers, have a good lineup of licensed products and expect growing contributions from our new line of early learning products for preschool students. Also, retailers have indicated that advertising will increase this year, which should drive traffic in the stores. The degree of success, however, will be  driven by retail sell-through and replenishment orders, which depends on the consumer. ", "In the Specialty Chemicals segment, we had record sales and earnings for continued success with our marketplace participation strategies, including benefits from our innovative Pine Chemicals product for the ink, adhesives and oilfield drilling markets, as well as the busy summer season for asphalt road paving in North America. ", "Not only are certain trends in our favor in these markets, but we are gaining business with both new and existing customers from strategies to clearly quantify the cost and performance benefits of our formulations versus competing technologies. Volumes of carbon for evaporative emissions control were lower than the prior year in previous years' quarters as global auto productions fell following the tsunami in Japan. The major Japanese automakers have indicated the production is normalizing, so we should see some recovery moving forward. And we've also worked to offset this temporary declines in auto markets with gains in purification carbon from global food, water and beverage markets. ", "In Community Development and Land Management, we continue to generate sales of rural and recreational land during the quarter. We closed on approximately 4,700 acres for gross proceeds of $11 million, or an average price per acre of about $2,300. We also made excellent progress in the development business, achieving some significant derisking thresholds by securing approvals for infrastructure funding for our Parks of Berkeley development in Summerville, near Charleston, South Carolina. These milestones not only add value to our profit by eliminating some of the risk to development, they've also helped to generate interest from top-tier home builders and commercial developers for lots in the first phase of the project. As we discussed in depth at our June investor event, Charleston remains a very attractive market for residential and industrial development, including properties that can take advantage of the expanding Port of Charleston and new Boeing Dreamliner assembly plant in the region. ", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss some of our financial metrics for the second quarter. Mark?", "E. Rajkowski", "Thanks, Jim. Second quarter reflected continued strong performance for MWV across all key financial metrics. It was the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in earnings and operating cash flows. Our results reflect the changes we've made to our business model to create a more consistent and higher-performing company that is generating the strong returns in this still a  challenging environment and set to outperform under more normal economic conditions. ", "Some highlights from the second quarter include sales growth of 9%, driven by price and mix improvement and a very strong contribution from emerging market sales. Record second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.54, driven by a 21% improvement in adjusted operating profit, which, at $176 million, was also a record, and very strong cash flow from operations of about $160 million. I'll now review our second-quarter results and then provide our outlook for the current quarter.", "Starting with sales, our 9% improvement was driven by strategies to increase business and gain market share in our most profitable markets, as well as to increase pricing based on the value that we're delivering to our customers. Our continued success in these areas resulted in price/mix contribution of 6 percentage points in the quarter, and our growing positions outside the U.S. also led to significant positive impact from foreign currency exchange. Our sales continue to be strengthened by the diverse geographic mix of our business portfolio, including leading positions in emerging markets where we delivered 22% growth in the second quarter. ", "Our revenue increases continue to be accompanied by improvements in our gross margins. We expanded margins with improved price and mix from our advantage product offerings and by leveraging our enhanced operating platform, which drove 250 basis points of year-over-year improvement to adjusted gross margins during the second quarter. We're continuing to deliver excellent manufacturing productivity with ongoing operational excellence initiatives and higher utilization rates from our streamlined asset base. ", "With our sharpened end market focus, we are increasing investments in new product development and commercial capabilities that we expect will continue to translate into profitable growth for our company. While $18 million of the year-over-year SG&A increase is noncash items, including stock-based compensation and the impact of FX translation, the remainder is primarily driven by growth investments across our business units. The innovation and commercial capabilities that we're funding have enabled the expansion of our market positions in food, beverage, personal care and healthcare, as well as the growth that we've seen in emerging markets. These investments are important components of our plan to substantially improve our business model, as evidenced by this quarter's record operating profits and expansion of our operating margins to over 11%.", "As I mentioned at the outset, cash flow from operations was very strong during the second quarter, more than doubling to over $160 million. Higher earnings were the primary driver of the significant improvement over last year. We are expecting to generate solid free cash flow levels for the full year, which we defined as cash after CapEx and dividends, but before project-related commitments that include our expansion project in Brazil and new Covington biomass boiler. ", "During the quarter, we invested $151 million in capital bringing our total capital spend through the first half of the year to $264 million. Approximately 1/2 of our year-over-year to date spend is related to the expansion of our Brazil business, which is progressing very well. For the full year, we expect total CapEx to be between $650 million to $700 million, which includes approximately $300 million for our Brazil expansion and $50 million for our Covington biomass boiler. ", "Now, turning to our outlook for the third quarter. We expect to extend our record of year-over-year profit growth in the third quarter. However, comparisons in the back half of the year do get tougher as we begin to fully cycle last year's pricing action and expect to see greater inflationary pressure across key raw materials and freight. We are also closely watching global demand trends, which have been particularly uneven in the U.S. and Europe due to the significant economic and unemployment challenges consumers still face in these regions. We will address these factors by continuing to shift our product mix towards higher value solutions and pursue value-based pricing, by continuing to penetrate fast-growing emerging markets, particularly Brazil, China and India, and by continuing to realize manufacturing productivity gains. ", "Now a quick rundown of our third quarter outlook by segment. In the Packaging Resources segment, as we head into the busiest season for our products, we expect profits to be modestly above our record segment profit in the second quarter. Order backlogs are at 3 weeks for bleached paperboard and 5 weeks for Coated Natural Kraft, which is a normal level for this time of the year. We're continuing to generate solid demand and targeted higher value food and beverage grades. We also expect to continue to benefit from pricing actions taken over the last 12 months, albeit to a lesser extent as many of the more significant pricing actions that we've taken over the last year occurred in the first half of 2010. We expect high single-digit increases in costs for raw materials and freight, as well as an outage at our marked paperboard mill to partially offset these positive factors. ", "In the Consumer Solutions segment, we expect profits to be similar to year-ago levels. Price/mix improvement, including the recovery of high resin cost through contractual price escalators and continued productivity gains will be the main drivers of improved performance. We expect these benefits to be largely offset by higher cost for raw materials, particularly resin and as well as freight. ", "In the Specialty Chemicals segment, we expect another strong year-over-year increase in profits. Benefits from continued solid demand across Pine Chemical and activated carbon markets, price and mix improvements and higher productivity levels are expected to drive substantially improved earnings. However, inflation in certain raw materials and freight cost will partially offset these positive factors. ", "In the Consumer & Office Products segment, sell-in and sell-through of branded consumer products for the back-to-school season are the key drivers of second and third quarter results. Overall, we're expecting segment profit to be flattish with last year's strong performance. ", "In our Community Development and Land Management business, real estate market conditions make it difficult to forecast sales and earnings. As we outlined at our Investor Day, we are continuing with our approach to marketing that we expect will generate premium values per acre. That said, buyer confidence in response to macroeconomic trends has remained relatively weak. As such, we're expecting land sales at levels consistent with the just announced second quarter. With that, I'll now turn it back to John.", "John Luke", "Mark, thanks very much. To summarize, we're pleased with the results we deliver during the second quarter, consistent with our record of continuing progress in recent years. The strong product portfolio and geographic mix of our business that we have carefully built across the set of targeted growing markets has proven to be a competitive advantage and a source of substantial value for our shareholders. While not immune to the challenges that may come our way in the global economy, it is this leading position that gives us confidence in our ability to respond to any such challenges and to continue our solid performance going forward. This will conclude our prepared remarks, and we'd now be happy to address your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]  And our first question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "John, just a couple of things. Can you talk a little bit more about Brazil? You got a pretty aggressive timeline there and I'm assuming that you'd already have a sense of how that's going and whether the slower economy in Brazil is going to change your expectations for the product -- projects' payoff?", "John Luke", "Mark, you were breaking up a little bit. But so if I don't fully answer all of your questions, come back, because I'm sure you will. I think with respect to Brazil, we are very confident, as Jim indicated, in the rate of progress we're making and the plans that we're developing. I think we're seeing clearly a little bit of variability in the Brazilian economy. None of which was unexpected given the very high rate of growth we saw -- record rate of growth we saw 12 months ago. But as we look ahead at the investments that are being made in the industry, the investments are being made and further planned in infrastructure, the outlook for Brazil over the coming years should be good. So our progress, both in the installation we have underway and in the market development to support that installation, we're very comfortable with.", "Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Okay. And just one second question. Obviously, SG&A is up and you're spending on a bunch of different things. Covington's a pretty big project. Can you give us a little bit of a sense of the timing of the benefits that come with both of those big spending initiatives?", "John Luke", "Yes. Let me start an overview, and I'll ask Jim and Mark to pipe in with any follow-on comments. I think with the SG&A, certainly, that's supporting directly our investment in market participation strategies. In some cases, we are already beginning to see the benefits of that. In other cases, over the next 12, 18 months, we'll see and we'll link the progress we're making right back to specific investments we've made, whether it is in innovation, both design, the development of technology, whether it is in specific expansion of our capabilities in emerging markets or whether it is broadening our product mix. So all of those things are things that will be coming along nicely. Clearly, the Covington project is going to take some time to complete, but we would expect fully to be seeing the benefits of that as we move into 2014.", "E. Rajkowski", "Yes, John, I Just would add a couple of points. One is that, Mark, I think we are already seeing some of the benefits of investments that we've been making in SG&A. As you'll look at the bottom line, our operating profit is at a record level. We've been able to expand our margin, and a large part of that is a function of our ability to bring new higher value-added products to our customers. And that enables us to get better pricing and better margins. So I think we're seeing some of that already. We are seeing volumes improve in certain subsegments of our business such as food, components of beauty and personal care and healthcare. And that's what has us very excited about the future is that we do think there's really some upside in those end markets and in our emerging markets to deliver good volume growth in the years -- quarters and years ahead.", "John Luke", "Yes. And I would just come back on that and supplement what Mark has just said, Mark, by noting that if you're really going to grow and grow in new areas, as we are, the kind of investments we're making are very logical and appropriate. And so we're very bullish as we -- we're methodical, but we're very bullish about how and where we're spending the money and about the upside potential, the real stick-to-your-ribs kind of growth that's going to come from it.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America.", "George Staphos", "I guess I wanted to dig a little bit into your success thus far in food packaging markets. Can you talk at all about whether you're having any success in installing machines in the food markets? And then generally speaking, if you could parse the market a bit more, where you're having the most success with your board or product offerings on the converted side?", "John Luke", "Let me comment, George, it's John, at the outset and I'll ask Jim or Mark to follow on there. I think you raised the interesting question with machines. This is an area where we clearly excelled in beverage bringing tremendous efficiencies to our customers' businesses in enhancing the quality and efficiency of their overall supply chain. And these are things that we'll be actively considering as we broaden our participation in the food business. We have, as we've talked, also developed and have in test, or further will in test, several game-changing platforms that will be important as well, particularly as it gets to packaging that enhances our customers' product on store shelves. Much of what we've done to date relates to specific converter partner, brand owner, led partnerships that relate to the careful selection of our board to package and present to consumers brands that our customers want to market more successfully. And I mentioned the contracts that we have with customers like General Mills, Kellogg and others, and these are just examples of where we have a significantly enhanced participation and in all of these cases where we're working diligently to work with a group, a select group of converter partners, to accomplish this end. Jim?", "James Buzzard", "Yes thanks, John. Let me just supplement, George, with a couple of comments. Clearly, as I noted in my comments, Asia and Europe had been very strong for us in food. A lot of that is driven, as John suggested, by our engagement with the brand owner. And they're recognizing that the aesthetics and the styling of our board relative to competing products in Europe really helps drive sales off the shelf. And so we're seeing good success there. The strength of our CUK products in the frozen food markets is also a big advantage, so we see a lot less damage at the store shelf, a lot less returns coming back that the brand owners to pay for. So quantifying that value and selling is what really led to strong performance there as well.", "John Luke", "And I would just supplement that again with something I alluded to but didn't mention directly earlier. And that is that with products, as I mentioned in my opening comments, like Evertain, a new design, a mix of broad range designs, as well as new materials, enhanced materials, particularly some that we're exploring with unique barrier properties, will be all part of the mix that we'll be introducing to the food, as well as other markets.", "George Staphos", "Okay. I had sort of one follow-on and a related question then I'll turn it over. In Europe in particular, Jim, are you competing against the things like chipboard? Is that why you're having success with your product relative to whatever call chain and distribution chain issues the other boards may be having a problem with? And then the additional question, I mean, obviously, in the last couple of months, we've -- at least from the data, seen some weakening in box board markets. You've seen some announcements. Obviously, your performance has been very good, but related areas in packaging are showing some deceleration as the quarter ended. Can you help us a little bit with how your early third quarter trends have been?", "James Buzzard", "In terms of the frozen food markets, that's not only Europe, but it's also in North America as well. And that's primarily against coated recycled board products and, to a degree, against SBS as well. The styling and the aesthetics that I've talked about would be against FPB and other competing boards. I think as we came out of the second quarter and into the third quarter, as we look at our order intake, it actually has been pretty steady for the first 2 or 3 weeks of July. And our backlogs, I think, as we noted, have been holding at 3 weeks, which for this time in year is where we would expect them to be. We would anticipate a little bit of an uptick in September and early fall. So we see it sort of playing out as it normally does this time at the back half of 2011.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the disruptions you're seeing, I guess, from the project down in Brazil? I guess they offset the productivity in PRG. I'm just wondering how we should think about that moving forward. I assume it would get a little bit stiffer as you move -- continue on with the project?", "James Buzzard", "Gail, I'm sorry, you broke up. This is Jim. I didn't -- are you talking about disruptions in Brazil?", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Well I'm Assuming you had -- you're showing negative net productivity in PRG but then you said you actually had positive productivity. So I'm assuming it has to do with the work you're doing in Brazil. Is that correct? And if so, can you give us a sense of how that will play out over the next few quarters?", "E. Rajkowski", "Yes, Jim can clarify that.", "James Buzzard", "Sure. Gail, at this point, no impact from the Brazil expansion. The negative productivity that you see -- saw within PRG, we had positive manufacturing productivity and continue to deliver that. Offsetting that, we have some onetime hits. And also, we offset our investments in growth against that as well. And so those are the primary reasons why you see a negative number. But from a manufacturing basis, continue to deliver good productivity and on track for the rest of the year to maintain that momentum.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And there have been some reports in the trade press that you've been producing and selling some pulp from Evadale, can you talk a little bit about that, confirm whether you're not doing it and if this is just kind of the one-off or something that's sustainable moving forward?", "James Buzzard", "Sure. You're right. We have started the E2 backup to manufacturer pulp. I would note that we will not make bleached board off of that machine. Just the bleached softboard pulp rather. It really is an opportunistic move on our part. It lets us balance out the back-end of the mill. We can produce it very cost effectively. We can be in and out of that markets. So it really is a lot of good thinking by the team down there to help drive improved earnings performance. But we'll do it on an opportunistic basis.", "Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And just going back to the price cost in CSG. I mean I guess if resins are starting to stabilize, should we expect to start to see that gap narrow through the back half of the year, assuming costs kind of stay where they are at the end of third -- at the end of the second quarter?", "James Buzzard", "That's right. We saw a dramatic run-up really throughout the first quarter and the second quarter. At the end of June, they trended down a little bit. So as I noted, our prices lag that, and those are now going into place. And so we should see that begin to reverse itself.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Just back on the box board business, you mentioned in your comments that you were likely to see more cost pressure ahead. But you also said that you're backlogs are basically just balanced at this point. Does this mean, kind of as we go through the second half of the year, you're unlikely to be able to do anything else from a pricing standpoint to offset those cost increases?", "James Buzzard", "Mark, this is Jim. I would not draw that conclusion. We continue to see cost pressure in freight, a number of the raw materials, TiO2, cost-regulated season [ph] and other things. But as those come through, we will continue to do our best in the marketplace to raise prices. And again, a lot of it will be about market participation strategies and where we put our board. So the combination of those 2 things will be front and center for the team.", "John Luke", "Yes. I would just reinforce what Jim has said, Mark, by drilling down on the notion of the market participation strategies. We continue to improve the mix of products that we're selling and with that, wherever we can, demonstrate the value that our products bring to our customers. And that bolsters the pricing that we seek to derive from those transactions.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. And Jim, I just -- remind because I can't recall. Have you ever done things like just put on freight surcharges to try to recoup some of these costs? Or do you prefer to go for kind of an  across-the-board price hike?", "James Buzzard", "Mark, on the box board side, where we -- and domestically, particularly, we do have freight surcharges in place that we utilize. But things like some of the surcharges for Bunker C on exports, we try and get back through a general price increase. So it really is a mix of both strategies.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. All right. And then just back over to Brazil. I just want to be kind of clear on what exactly you're saying about down there. Was your box business actually negative from a volume standpoint in the second quarter?", "James Buzzard", "Yes, it was.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. And is that -- Jim, I know that there's a lot of produce that's exported out of Brazil. So I'm curious, is any of this just a result of a very strong, hey I, kind of limiting, say, produce exports? Or is it just more of a slowing in the overall economy?", "E. Rajkowski", "There's a modest impact from exports. Probably around 10% or 15% of our business goes into products that are eventually exported. So primarily driven just by what we see as a temporary slowdown in the Brazilian economy.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Are there particular niches of your business where you see that slowing most pronounced down there?", "E. Rajkowski", "No, it was really pretty much across the board in all the markets.", "E. Rajkowski", "And again, I think, Mark, as you know, knowing Latin America as well as you do, that as we reinforced here, this relative softness has to be viewed in the context of last year's performance, which was just off the charts by any measure.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. And then, Jim, I wonder over in the Consumer Office products, is it possible for you to kind of give us a little differentiation here between kind of what's going on in the domestic market, what's going on in the international? And then within the domestic, sort of what's going on in terms of sort of the commodity businesses where I think you've been dealing with imports for many, many years versus the more -- the value-added products that you sell in domestic market?", "James Buzzard", "Sure, Mark. I'll take the domestic question first. We really have worked hard over the last 2 or 3 years to move out of the commodity portion of that business. So a big portion of what we do is what we consider to be value added. This is the big time of the year for that marketplace. So our sell-in into the stores has been very solid for us. The product placement in the stores looks very good this year. Our big retail partners are suggesting increased promotions as well. So all of the things are in place to have a good back-to-school season. Having said that, we're all holding our breath now because now it's up to the consumer to come in and spend. And given the economic situation, we just have to wait and see where that goes. That drives the replenishment orders in the back half of the season. But we're entering the season, we believe, places as well as we have been. Internationally, Brazil is -- their real back-to-school season is more December, January. So the comments there is we are -- we're performing better than we have. We've broadened our products base, so we're seeing better participation. But the real driver there will be Q4 and Q1 of 2012.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. Then the last question I have. John, is it possible to just share a few thoughts with us in terms of what's going on inside of Meadwestvaco right now in terms of succession planning?", "John Luke", "Mark, I think that we continue to address those questions in the context of our overall organization development. And this is something that the board actively works at as a priority area of it's responsibility.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group", "The cap spend, you clarified $650 million to $700 million this year. Any ability to give us a little preview as to what it might look like next year? And in particular, how much more of the Covington spend would there be remaining, as well as Brazil for next year?", "John Luke", "Yes. Mark, let me give you the highlights on that. We're expecting -- if you look at the big areas of spend, you have our Brazil expansion and also our new biomass boiler in Covington. So breaking those down, our investment in Brazil, we'd expect roughly 2/3 of that to be spent in 2011 with the remainder next year through the first half. So we'll see a ramping down next year of cap spend related to that project. On the other hand, with the biomass boiler, as we indicated in our comments, this year, we're expecting spending in the range of $50 million or so with a ramping up in 2012. So those will largely be offsetting the -- so that's really the way you can think about that. And those are really the biggest drivers of spend.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group", "So if I -- taking those numbers, should I be thinking next year's probably going to be in the $600 million to $650 million range?", "John Luke", "I'd say that's a fair view.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group", "And just one real quick easy one. When you talked in -- you have on the slides, on the third slide, it says Q3 outlook, modest profit growth versus Q3 2010. Is that compared to a $0.63 EPS number in the third quarter of last year? What was the base you're using for last year's EPS?", "John Luke", "I think our operational base was $0.62 per share.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.", "Phil Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I was wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing in the box board markets from an import standpoint. I know imports have always been a modest factor, but it sounds like competition has increased recently. So I was wondering if you are seeing it at all in the markets you participate in for SBS or CNK.", "James Buzzard", "This is Jim. No, I can't say that the markets where we are playing we're seeing much impact at all.", "Phil Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. And then just following up on the cash flow side. Given the significant capital spending that you have in store, how are you thinking about incremental capital allocation from here? And how are you thinking about your target leverage right now given the macroenvironment?", "John Luke", "Phil, I think that we've certainly benefited from what has been a strengthening of our financial position, cash balances and liquidity over the last several years through the downturn. And we're going to take advantage of that and we are looking at using a combination of cash, and as we mentioned also, some debt down in Brazil to fund our Rigesa expansion. And we do have cash that we expect to use to fund our biomass boiler in -- at Covington. But we'll look to maintain a relatively efficient and, I'd say at this point, probably conservative capital structure given what continues to be a uncertain economic environment looking forward.", "Phil Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. And then the last question just on Specialty Chemicals. As you think about the sequential trends here from second quarter to third, is there anything that you think would prevent you from seeing a profit improvement quarter-over-quarter? I mean usually, you do see that seasonally. So just any thoughts you have on that.", "E. Rajkowski", "So quarter sequential for the entire company, Phil?", "Phil Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "For Specialty Chemicals, specifically.", "E. Rajkowski", "For Specialty Chemicals. I think we're on that type of a trajectory, for sure, Phil.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Question on box board pricing. Clearly, the momentum is pretty healthy there. And the presentation, it looks like you realized about $100 million benefit from higher box board pricing in the first half. Based on the increase that has already been implemented in the marketplace for both bleached board and CUK, what do you think the pricing benefit will be from box board in the second half of 2011?", "James Buzzard", "Alex, this is Jim. Clearly, I think as we noted, a lot of those actions were in the first half of 2010. So we've got a lot of the benefit to date. As you know, on the bleached board side, we have announced price increase in the markets right now that we're working through. And so we would expect to see some continued benefit, but it won't be as large at it has been to date.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. And just to follow on the Packaging Resources business. Correct me if I'm wrong, but most of the bleached board business is going into or sold to third-party converters while the CUK business is integrated with the converting capacity and Consumer Solutions. Can you talk about what kind of pricing you guys are seeing on the converting side of the box board business and whether you're actually passing through the entire change on the tonnage basis in CUK on the converting side? Or is that going to happen over time as contracts are renegotiated there? How does that work?", "John Luke", "Yes, let me start. And Jim, you can fill in any of the blanks. But as we price our business on the converting side, we do so based on value and look to make sure that we get paid for the value of the service that we're providing. A lot of that business is done through contract with large customers. And those negotiations take place on a periodic basis. We've got longer-term contracts. And in there, we look to get paid for value but also ensure that we're protected for things like inflation in raw materials and in freight. So we are very much pricing to market and looking to get paid for the service that we provide in through those contracts.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay, that's helpful. Just a question on the land business. I think heading into Analyst Day, I think part of the rationale for the day was to provide a current detail to the marketplace to potentially have the share price better reflect the value of the land. Since that day, it doesn't appear like that's been the case. The stock's actually traded off modestly. And given the fundamental strength of the business, it seems pretty clear that the value of the land is not at all reflected in the valuation of the stock now. How frustrated are you with the fact that, that's probably the case, that the land, which is pretty valuable -- which is a pretty valuable asset doesn't appear to be at all reflected in the share price right now?", "John Luke", "Alex, I think you've noted something that, among other things, prompted our desire at the point in time we had the Investor Day to ensure that folks understood the dynamics of the business and, clearly, the upside potential with the clear strategies that are being developed. We would love to see a higher value reflected in our stock price. But we also recognize that the combination of 2 things will drive that: one, continued performance and demonstration of that performance; and with that, continued education of the investment community as to the underlying value. And along the way, hopefully, we will see much greater recognition of the intrinsic value of this property, as well as Specialty Chemicals, and we'll see that reflected in the stock price. But we recognize that we've got a job to do on both counts.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Maybe I can ask just one last question. On the Specialty Chemicals business, the margins there now or the EBIT margins are north of 25%. I think the long-term target that was presented at the Analyst Day was 15% to 20%. So what are you worried about in that business that you think longer term, the margins would have to compress from where they are today to what you think is a more normalized to 15% to 20% margin?", "John Luke", "Well, one of the things that we talked about down at our Investor Day is the fact that we are going to continue to invest in new products, in new markets. And that can, from time-to-time, certainly, as you initiate those investments, you don't get that peak level of return as you're doing that. So certainly, our sites remain high and we're going to be looking to deliver margins in that 25% target. But in running the business and as you go through the cycles of investment and looking to grow out your new products and in new markets, you are, from time to time, going to -- you're going to hit lower points. And that's really more a function of what we're thinking about there as opposed to any untoward series of events or competitive threats.", "John Luke", "Yes. And I think I would just pick that up and say that as you saw down in Charleston, Alex, we've got an excellent leadership group. And you've had a chance to see firsthand an extended grouping of individuals who are really helping drive that business forward. What we've got are opportunities in 2 areas. One, as Mark said, new areas of participation that we're very disciplined and discerning about defining and moving towards, but recognizing that they may bring some of the challenges Mark alluded to, as well as significant opportunities we're continuing to grow with the -- what we have now is a core mix of products and businesses, both here in Europe and, very importantly, in markets like China and, increasingly, India, not to mention Brazil. So we see an awful lot of profitable growth potential.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Peter Ruschmeier with Barclays Capital.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Just a couple of housekeeping questions here on the cash flow, maybe for Mark. Do you have any guidance for us on cash tax versus book tax this year?", "E. Rajkowski", "Pete, I don't -- there's nothing there that suggests there's going to be a big gap between our book and cash tax. So...", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Okay. That's helpful. And in terms of -- is pension income still expected to be around $80 million for the full year?", "E. Rajkowski", "Yes.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Okay. And then how do you think about working capital, either on a back half of the year basis or a full year basis in terms of source versus use?", "Mark Lewis", "I think as we've looked at the back half of the year and think about some of what we've got facing us in terms of our big outage at Covington and Mart [ph], we have consciously built up our inventory levels and we certainly expect those to be drawn down over the second half of the year. So I'd expect more of a source of cash coming from working capital than a use of cash.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Okay. And as it relates to those 2 outages, Covington and Mart, is the economic cost of that primarily the lack of -- the opportunity cost? Or are there any quantifiable expenses that you're going to run through income statement that you could help us out with?", "James Buzzard", "Pete, it's Jim. It's really a combination of both. So normal recovery boiler outage at Mart and the expenses that are related to that for maintenance and then a more significant outage at Covington, which, again, there's some lost opportunity, but also the expenses related to the upgrade we're doing there, as well as recovery boiler outage there.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Any way to quantify either on a standalone or a combined basis kind of the economic impact of those outages?", "E. Rajkowski", "Well I think we laid out in our comments last quarter, Pete, that the Covington outage, which Jim referred to, which is the more significant one, is we expect to have an impact of around $30 million.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Okay, that's helpful.  And coming back to EBITDA for a second, did you sell any tons in the second quarter? And looking to 3Q and beyond, how many tons do you think you could sell on a, say, on a quarterly basis?", "John Luke", "Pete, we're at a very modest impact in Q2 and we're really just ramping up at this point in time. So we're doing work in the markets and making sure we're doing this the right way. But you could assume we're up and running at a run-rate basis and doing what we think we can do, we might be in the 25,000 to 30,000 tons a quarter.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Okay. And just lastly, maybe. As you think about some of the sensitivities about the macroenvironment, I'm curious on what you're seeing in back-to-school. If you can elaborate a little bit on kind of the mood and the tenor and your outlook for the third quarter, the types of behavioral order patterns and type of behavior you're seeing in the marketplace?", "James Buzzard", "Sure, Pete.  As I said, going into it, we feel very good. The combination of our product and its placement in the stores and what we hear as the level of promotion all give us good feelings. But this is always the nervous time of the year for us. And I think everything that I have read suggests that the consumers are going to buy a little bit later. So I think we'll see it push back a little bit. And you have to believe that they will continue to be guarded in their spending patterns. And so the forecasts I've seen are sort of flat to maybe slight declines in back-to-school in total. How that plays out in our categories, we really have to wait and see. It's too soon for us to tell.", "Operator", "And our last question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.", "Chip Dillon", "I don't know if you actually reviewed this, but the Mart Mill, which you said was going to be down in the third quarter, when was the last time that mill took an extensive shut? I don't believe it's every year in the third quarter, is it?", "James Buzzard", "It's a -- we have historically taken recovery boiler outages on an annual basis. It could move a little bit from quarter to quarter.", "Chip Dillon", "And was it last year in the third quarter as well?", "James Buzzard", "Chip, I'd have to confirm and get back to you, but I think it was in the fourth quarter.", "Chip Dillon", "So it's a little bit, if you will, a challenge. And you're making an improvement this year in the third quarter in resources versus last year without having had to incur the downtime last year. So just to clarify, it's a bit more of a challenge that you're overcoming this year?", "James Buzzard", "That would be correct Chip, yes.", "Chip Dillon", "And then second question is you had talked earlier about CapEx, which I know you're not solid on in terms of a number for next year. But if we sort of combine '11 and '12 and we're approaching, I guess, $1.3 billion, which is sort of, I don't know, 3x what you had spent say in '09 and '10, which makes sense given that the economy is better, but as we look beyond '12, it would seem like Rigesa's basically done, Covington would be done. Do you anticipate more projects or spending of this magnitude in '13 and '14, barring any changes or major acquisitions?", "John Luke", "Chip, let me answer that. And Jim and Mark can chime in. I think the short answer is that you would normally expect, and we would expect with our planning, to see a ratcheting down of capital expenditures as we move forward. Our capital expenditures outside of normal maintenance are and will continue to be driven by economically profitable returns on projects that will enable us to enhance our market participation and growth here and around the world. And so at whatever level we are spending, you can expect to hold us to the expectation of solid profitable -- economically profitable returns. But again, I would go back to say that the unusually strong level of spend now will clearly be ratcheting down in the wake of these projects.", "Jason Thompson", "That concludes our call, everyone. Thanks for joining us, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

My name is Caroline and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Rock-Tenn's Third Quarter Fiscal 2011 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.", "(Operator Instructions) As a reminder slides are being presented today as part of the conference call. These slides can be accessed at www.rocktenn.com under the investor\u2019s page. Ladies and gentlemen, this call is being recorded today, August 3rd, 2011. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.", "Your speakers for today's call are Mr. James Rubright, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Steve Voorhees, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Rubright you may begin your conference.", "James A. Rubright", "Thank you, good morning all. We appreciate you joining our call and your interest in our company. During the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements of course within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws which involves statements regarding our plans, expectation, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discussed.", "We include a description of certainties, risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking in our 2010 Form 10-K and similar disclosures on our subsequent SEC filings. Also during the call we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures. We provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and in the appendix of this slide presentation which is also available on our website on the investor tab.", "This morning I\u2019ll begin with the commentary on the performance of our businesses during the quarter and our recently closed acquisition of Smurfit-Stone. I\u2019ll provide an overview of our plans and expectations for capital expenditures going forward and then Steve Voorhees will provide an overview of our segment disclosure and cover non-operating items in our financial statements. After our prepared comments Steve and I will be available for questions.", "Our legacy operations at Rock-Tenn made about $0.96 per share in the quarter compared to $1.04 at last year in the quarter and this was due to lower production from the major maintenance outage at our Demopolis mill which as you know on a two year major maintenance schedule and as a result the disruption and production reductions from this outage reduced earnings by about $0.10 per share.", "As a result higher pricing and volume in our consumer packaging business more than offset higher fiber chemical and freight costs. Our consumer packaging margins were good, our folding carton plants continue to gain share with our volumes up 1.6% against an industry that was down 3.7% over the prior year quarter.", "Our beverage partition business, which we now report with our folding carton business were nicely over the prior year and performed very well financially during the quarter. Our integrated partition business is the largest customer of our uncoated recycled paperboard mills, which are now also included in our Consumer segment. Merchandising displays also grew over the prior year as we continue to differentiate ourselves with our customer value proposition and we included the five Smurfit display plants in this sector, they have annual sales of about $240 million bringing our total annual display sales to over $600 million per year.", "Coated recycled paperboard market demand continues to be very strong, we again said no economic downtime in the quarter and we take \u2013 and we expect to take no economic downtime for this foreseeable future. At Rock-Tenn, our SBS backlogs are healthy and we [go] back to a normal level of about one month\u2019s production as a result of the outage in that levels about normal for this time of the year.", "However, we believe that our backlogs maybe significantly stronger than many of our competitors. So, at least for us as with coated recycled paperboard, we expect to take no economic downtime in our bleached paperboard operations.", "Our legacy corrugated packaging plants and our Solvay recycled containerboard mill performed well during the quarter, particularly given the higher fiber, chemical and freight costs as we incurred.", "I would say that balancing those freight costs, our volume increases and the integration benefits, which have continued to keep this acquisition on track to our 2008 acquisition cases. With that brief summary, I\u2019ll turn to the Smurfit-Stone acquisition. The initial integration went very well renewal service of production disruptions and this allowed us to focus on synergy capture and business improvements.", "The customer reception to this transaction has been terrific and it\u2019s more than fulfilled our high expectations. We currently have many opportunities to increase sales of the combined operations.", "As part of our plan to improve the cost structure of our corrugated box plant network, we announced the closure of four corrugated box plants. Our goal with these closures is to retain substantially all of the business by transferring into other well capitalized plants in our system.", "Our containerboard mills also ran very well during the \u2013 one month that we own them. As we previously discussed with you, we believe that our challenge this quarter would be meeting our system demand.", "During June, we accordingly took no economic downtime and we had about an average amount of maintenance downtime. During these running conditions, and the improvements we\u2019ve made in the mill and box plant operations, corrugated packaging EBITDA margins were 16.2% for June for first full month of our ownership. When you compare our EBITDA margins to the \u2013 EBITDA margins of the other two high-performing integrated containerboard companies, our corrugated packaging EBITDA margins compared well. We were somewhat below IP, and that has given the value they created with Weyerhaeuser acquisition and they were slightly ahead of packaging core, our margins of course, were well ahead of Temple-Inland just we expected.", "From financial standpoint, we\u2019re well ahead of the acquisition pro forma guidance we gave in announcing the acquisition. I'd like to go over some numbers that sort of go back to what we would forecast and then demonstrate just how well we\u2019ve done.", "At the time when we announced the acquisition, we forecasted that our pro forma net debt as of March 31, 2011 would have been $3.7 billion. Our actual net debt at June 30 was $3.43 billion. In addition, our pension under funding as of that date is approximately $100 million or lower than our guidance on a pre-tax basis or $65 million after-tax.", "Thus our balance sheet has about $330 million less debt and after-tax pension obligations and we established as our acquisition baseline case as of March 31. This equates to more than $5 per share that were better off from a net debt and pension obligation standpoint than our acquisition forecast.", "In addition, our acquisition forecast also had beginning debt-to-EBITDA at a ratio of 2.8 times. In the event, our credit agreement EBITDA as of June 30 was $1.4 billion and our leverage ratio is 2.53 times. So we\u2019re much less leveraged than the 2.8 times acquisition forecast and a 4.3 and 4.2 starting leverage for our Gulf States and Southern Container acquisitions.", "The Smurfit-Stone acquisition was highly accretive for the 34 days; we own the assets with EPS accretion of approximately 33% per share. This accretion is affected substantially by the GAAP calculation of average shares during the quarter, if you looked only at the actual accretion of the acquisition for the month of June; the accretion was closer to $0.23 per share.", "At the end of June, we estimate that the run rate of synergy capture is already within a range of $75 million to $80 million, which again is well ahead of our guidance. I know you will ask, so I\u2019ll break that down somewhat in to categories with synergies we\u2019ve [realized] to date consist of about $28 million in corporate overhead reduction in cost about $20 million in reduction in costs and operational activities including the box plant closures we\u2019ve discussed about $6 million in realized purchasing savings and then about $13 million in costs reduced in administrative areas primarily from the reduction in the number of people staffing those functions.", "Now I want to make it clear that we didn\u2019t realize anything like that amount in earnings for the full month of June, rather these are savings that we know we\u2019ve achieved and the savings from which we\u2019ll show up over the course of the September quarter particularly, for example the purchasing synergies where we put in place lower purchasing prices, but those purchasing prices will be reflected over the quarter and in part as we burn off existing supplies inventories.", "In addition, based on the planning and the work we\u2019ve done to date and the results of a number of our initiatives, I feel confident that we\u2019ll exceed the 150 million in synergies that we forecast. Although, I want to make it clear that in the future to the extend we realize that excess we will characterize it together with other performance improvements that we expect to achieve in the business over the coming months and the next few years.", "Now to be clear, we view performance improvements as involving more than the simple elimination of over lapse from the combination. We\u2019ve done an extensive review of the opportunities to flow from this combination and we\u2019ve identified about 400 million in performance improvements that we believe we can capture over the next 2.5 years.", "These performance improvements can be thought of this falling into three broad categories. First, we can achieve very high returns on strategic capital investments. Second, we can reduce our cost and achieve production efficiencies through operational and commercial excellence. We can accelerate initiatives in place in the former Smurfit plants and mills and by extending the Rock-Tenn business model to this very large business platform. Third, we can achieve further integration benefits through optimizing the combined operations and our administrative functions.", "To achieve these synergies and performance improvements, we expect to incur about a $135 million in cash restructuring expense over that period and to expand about $195 million in strategic capital investments all of which we expect to occur over the next 2.5 years.", "I\u2019d like to turn to some information that we prove previously disclosed and updated with respect to the cost structure of our mills. We\u2019ve previously shown a plot of our mill cash cost on the (inaudible) cost curves and we do so again in the accompanying slide for March 2011.", "We\u2019ve added cumulative capacity table at the bottom of the chart and you can see that 72% or our containerboard system capacity resides on the left side of the cost curve.", "We\u2019ve been asked from time to time about the state of the Smurfit assets and our capital expenditure needs going forward. At the time of the acquisition, we estimated that ongoing capital expenditures would be about $350 million per year, which represents about a $100 million in the near term for legacy Rock-Tenn given the opportunities we have in that business and about $250 million for the Smurfit assets.", "Our estimate of $250 million was about $40 million higher than the guidance that Smurfit has previously provided for 2011 and \u201912, which was about $210 million. Their guidance was based on their view of how they would operate the assets, but it also include significant capital of course some high impact projects in their mill system. The additional number that we estimated was based on our belief that we would likely invest more in modernization and maintenance upgrades capital than with Smurfit and our belief that the opportunities for very high return projects would be compelling.", "After a lot of work that we\u2019ve done primarily with the mill teams, we expect that $250 million that we forecast will actually be more or like $265 million in 2012. This includes the large capital projects that we\u2019ve previously discussed including those we\u2019ve mentioned at our Hodge and Hopewell mills these are projects that will materially reduce the cost an increase the productivity of those mills and much better balance our mix of virgin and recycle furnish.", "However, given the size of these projects, they will result in greater than normal outage downtime next year and concomitantly with greater than normal amount of production curtailment and earnings impacts. However they are very high return project.", "In addition to that base capital of $265 million we\u2019ll spend about $35 million in synergy capital. We\u2019ve discussed the need for this its primarily for IT systems, box plant optimization, the facilities cost note will necessary to create a space that will locate the activities and personal Smurfit that historically warehoused in St. Louis in Chicago and a number of other related projects.", "In addition, we\u2019ll spend about $35 million as fast as we can on energy projects that we have identified that mainly bring natural gas to some of the large virgin mills to substitute natural gas for fuel oil in mill powered boilers. These energy projects have very high returns in fact, the pay back periods are typically between one and two years based on the current oil natural gas MMbtu of cost spread.", "Finally, Smurfit leased virtually all of its material handing equipment. We of course will buy this equipment so far a more efficient way to own and finance your material equipment.", "Smurfit had a cluster of leased equipment coming of lease in 2012 and has result in addition to simply buying and rather than leasing this equipment we\u2019ll spend about $16 million to $18 million more than the normal usefulness of this equipment, which indicate would be a normal replacement rate. All in all, this will require us to incur another $45 million in capital expenditures in 2012 just for material handling equipment. If you add all this up, it results in capital expenditures of about $480 million in 2012.", "We expect that our capital expenditures will trend down over the course of the following two years to a normalized range in 2014 and beyond. We think the capital expenditures for the entire enterprise should be in the range of $350 million per year. This will maintain and replace our assets consistent with Rock-Tenn\u2019s practices and will continue to enhance the cost competitiveness of our overall business. This amount is generally consistent with the guidance we gave when we announced the acquisition.", "Further to complete the picture, we expect to spend about $90 million in the fourth quarter fiscal 2011, which includes some synergy, material handling replacement and performance improvement capital as well as normal base sustaining capital.", "In summary, our expectations for the acquisition have been confirmed by our detailed work and by the results we produced so far, which complement our well-positioned and profitable legacy business.", "With those comments, I\u2019d like now to turn the call over to Steve Voorhees and he\u2019ll review certain financial aspects of the quarter and provide some further assumptions to assist you in understanding our business and our prospects going forward.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Thanks, Jim. As you\u2019ve seen in the press release, we are now reporting our operating results in three segments. Corrugated Packaging has a $6.5 billion sales business and that includes our 14 containerboard mills and over 100 box plants.", "Consumer Packaging has a $2.5 billion business and that includes our folding carton plants, coated mills, specialty paperboard businesses and our merchandizing supplies business.", "As Jim said, the supply business has, currently has over annual sales of $600 million. The Recycling and Waste Solutions segment is the largest paper recycling in North America with $1.5 billion in sales.", "We are continuing to allocate cost to our businesses very similarly to how we\u2019ve allocated costs in the past. There is an exception with respect to pension cost. We are allocating the cost of additional pension benefits or service cost to each of our businesses as these benefits are earned by current employees. We estimate the service cost to be approximately $30 million per year or just over a half of our estimated fiscal year \u201812 pension expense of $57 million per year. The difference between $57 million and $30 million is $27 million and represents expenses associated with the unfounded pension liability and pension investment results. These additional expenses are included in total corporate expenses, which we expect to be approximately $120 million per year.", "We have restated our historical financial results to reflect our revised segments and allocations. As Jim said, we acquired Smurfit-Stone on May 27, so the June quarter and month results include 34 days of Smurfit-Stone results. As such, quarterly comparisons are difficult that said for the month of June, our Corrugated Packaging business reported $96 million in EBITDA and $596 million in the sales for an EBITDA margin of 16.2%.", "Consumer Packaging sales were $220 million in June with $32 million in EBITDA for a margin of 14.4% and our recycling business reported EBITDA of $3.6 million on $120 million in sales.", "As Jim said in June, Rock-Tenn earned $0.60 in adjusted EPS. We estimated that legacy Rock-Tenn would have made $0.47 per share in the month making the acquisition approximately $0.23 accretive in the month after accounting for their earnings for the Smurfit assets and the new debt and equity used to finance the acquisition. Jim described the reason for the difference in the GAAP accretion for the month as compared to the quarter.", "Due to the significant change in the composition of the business during the quarter would include the usage of key end products in the conference call materials. We are now using 19 million tons of wood and 4.4 million tons of recovered fiber in our mill operations.", "We are now using 26.7 Bcf of natural gas and 42.9 million gallons of fuel oil. At over $2 billion in annual run rate of expense we have the opportunity to use the scale of our business to acquire these commodities even more efficiently than we have in the past.", "And also providing the following information to assist those of you who are developing projections for Rock-Tenn. We expect the annual depreciation and amortization to be in the range of $550 million, our annual interest expense is currently running at $135 million.", "While we are expecting our book to tax rate to be between 35% and 36%, our cash tax rate will be substantially below this level due to net operating losses on our books of $497 million pretax or $174 million after tax. We expect to recover these net operating losses over the next two to three years.", "We are also expecting to receive the cash from the Cellulosic Biofuel Producer Credit. This amount is $77 million, which is available from the legacy Rock-Tenn operations and $69 million, which is available from the legacy Smurfit operations. We\u2019re expecting to receive the cash benefit of the cellulosic biofuel credits beginning after recovering the net operating losses and beginning in the 2013, 2014 timeframe.", "Finally, we have $70 million of alternative minimum tax credits available from legacy Smurfit that we expect to receive in the 2015, 2016 timeframe. All to all, these tax items aggregate to about $390 million in reduced US Federal cash taxes. This combined with our expected contributions to our pension plans, which are expected to be about $37 million in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year and $359 million in fiscal year 2012, provide the basis for our expected combined US state and foreign cash tax rate to be substantially below our book tax rate over the next three to five years. As you\u2019d expect, this is dependent on business conditions and other factors.", "We\u2019re very pleased with the support we receive from our banks and financing the acquisition. Rock Tenn now has $3.7 billion in bank term and revolving credit debt, and a $625 million accounts receivable securitization facility. Our credit facility has a normal add-back customer refund acquisition, including credit for historical Smurfit-Stone EBITDA for the July 2010 to May 2011 period. The leverage ratio of 2.53 times reflects the consolidated financial structure that we have in place that provides us with liquidity of $1.3 billion as of June 30. This is more than adequate to fund the strategies outlined by the Jim in his comments.", "That concludes by prepared remarks. Now Jim and I now invite your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, we will begin to question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) our first question comes from George Staphos from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Congratulations, good luck with the acquisition. I guess the first question I had, and Jim, I think you touched on this. It took like the Smurfit mills ran at around a million eight tons in the quarter, and not a lot of disruption, not a lot of downtime. It looks like a pretty good outcome. Can you comment how much of that was directed to third party versus internal conversion?", "James A. Rubright", "You know I don\u2019t have the number exactly in front of me. We\u2019ve indicated we\u2019re about 70% integrated as a system. We did see strong export demand and we\u2019ve been able to use relatively good export pricing and demand to balance our initiatives within the business to try to make sure that we\u2019re pricing products appropriately and sorting through the mix of business that really works for you and that which does not.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Jim, Steve if we think about the amount of downtime you're going to take next year around the maintenance projects, is there a way to quantify that at this juncture about how many tons it might be or what the earnings effect might be as we try to model out?", "James A. Rubright", "Sure. We expect to take about 250,000 tons on an annual basis next year of maintenance outage reduced production, in that I would estimate that 20,000 tons to 25,000 tons is incremental outage based on Hodge and Hopeville project. Most of those projects are oriented towards improvement on the paper machine that basically mean you\u2019re going to be down for longer periods of time. That would be normal for our maintenance outage.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Two last ones, then I'll turn it over. As we look at the corporate expense guidance that you provided, is there any expense that you or the legacy Smurfit operations used to allocate to the segment that's now included in that corporate, and if so, could you help us as we try to bounce between corporate and the segment, what that amount might be?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "The primary difference is our pension expense associated with the unfunded pension liability. We\u2019re allocating service cost only to the businesses that invest benefits earned by current employees, then the remainder, which is $27 million is within the 120 million.", "James A. Rubright", "I think the rest is that Staphos we\u2019ve looked at is really in the noise level.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Right.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Then lastly, it appear as from your comments that you did well in terms of cash flow and debt pay down. Is there any way to size what kind of, thus far, having closed on a deal, what kind of debt pay down you've had? Thank you.", "James A. Rubright", "Well, it\u2019s really hard to say what the debt pay down was, because when we benchmark the bench market against what the pro forma would have been at the time we announced the acquisition, so you really are backing up to an expected debt amount as of March 31 which we announced in January. So it\u2019s really hard to just tie it.", "I think it is just simpler to say, okay, I\u2019ve got it. I know how much debt you\u2019ve got and just move forward from there. And we disclose the cash generated from operations during the period of time and we disclose what it would be which includes the 34 days of Smurfit operations. And so we know we\u2019d end up having doing a disclosure of the actual Smurfit earnings and EBITDA and cash flow during the two months of April and May and it really would be difficult to comment on that on a GAAP basis.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "", "Okay. Thought I would try, but I appreciate it. I'll turn it over. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Mark Wilde from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Good morning, Jim. Good morning, Steve.", "James A. Rubright", "Good morning.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Jim, the projects at Hopewell and Hodge, will they boost the mill capacity for container board?", "James A. Rubright", "Yes.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "And do you have a sense of how much?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, it's significant, more than a 100,000 tons at Hodge. I don\u2019t remember exactly the number at Hopewell, but really what we\u2019re trying to do is move our recycle production in to virgin and to optimize the production at the most effective facilities we\u2019ve got. Hodge has that, you know, three out machine a very wide machine that can, we can increase the productivity of great deal and similarly, we can do the same thing at a very large machine at Hopewell.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Okay. And just the other side of that, I guess, is as you get these productivity gains there, any thoughts on capacity adjustments elsewhere?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, sure. What we will always do is run our system to our system demand. These projects because of the capital required in the planning and execution will be executed largely in fiscal 2012 outages, which are at least 12 months away, and as a result, we\u2019re not in a position to estimate what the system requirements are going to be as of that time. It is our view that you can create flexibility in your production requirements both to meet seasonal demand and other fluctuations through ultimately large capacity we\u2019ve got and recycled, because it\u2019s much more, you can either recycle capacity much more easily than you can virgin capacity, so I\u2019m not really anticipating any issues with respective balancing, our system production with respect to system demand.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Do you foresee at any point having to take any mill capacity out permanently?", "James A. Rubright", "I know you\u2019d love me to do that, Mark, but I\u2019m simply indicating that my answer is the answer I just gave you that will match our capacity and production to our system requirements at the time as we evaluate them.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. All right. That's fine. Another question. What do you think just be the legacy Smurfit business and container board can do on an EBITDA basis? Because if you just get the whole system to say that IP level that you showed, it seems like you've got Solvay and the legacy Rock-Tenn business providing a lot of lift, because your margins have been quite a bit higher than others in the industry. So I'm wondering, where the underlying Smurfit business can get to?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, I believe the combined business can be the most profitable business in the industry, that\u2019s our goal. Basically, I didn\u2019t believe we can do it, in 1999, when we started with Rock-Tenn, but we did and I think if you invest right you\u2019d get people directed in the right basis you can. Certainly, there is no reason that the assets we\u2019d acquire from Smurfit particularly given the state of the mill system can\u2019t be move to the left side of the cost curve.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Last question I had, just there's been a lot of talk just from private guys that I talk to in the industry that maybe Smurfit had been more aggressive from a volume standpoint leading up to the closing. Have you seen any evidence of that as you've owned the business for a couple months now?", "James A. Rubright", "", "I\u2019m not going to comment on what other people have said about, where our business is being conducted more.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. All right. Well, listen, good luck in the coming quarter.", "James A. Rubright", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.", "", "Good morning.", "James A. Rubright", "", "Good morning, Phil.", "Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.", "So, with respect to the additional CapEx for 2012, can you give us any thoughts around what kind of return do you think you can achieve in say, a 12 to 24 month time period on that incremental CapEx? Because I assume that's not in your synergies.", "James A. Rubright", "", "Well, as I said, the $150 million in synergies if you go back what we said at the time we announced, and that had primarily box plant synergies in it, but it did not have any mill synergy. So you\u2019re right, if not in the $150 million it is in the $400 million of incremental opportunities.", "I think the energy projects of the first ones will be able to get done, so you may see in the late winter or spring some kick from the $35 million of energy capital. By and large, this substantial amount of mill capital we don\u2019t get any benefit from until the end of fiscal \u201912 or the end of \u201913.", "These are very, very high returning projects. I think the lowest returning large project that I\u2019ve seen is a wood yard we\u2019re going to do at Florence and based on what we\u2019ve done at Demopolis and what we expect there you know that\u2019s a mid-20s return, but the Hodge and Hopewell projects are significantly higher than that as our all the energy projects.", "And then a good bit of the stuff that we\u2019re doing in terms of productivity and quality improvement through just basically modernization of the facilities have fairly very attractive returns.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "", "But again, yeah, most of that capital is really going to show up in late \u201912 and \u201913 just because a good bit of your schedule in connection with the outage cycle for 2012 and then second, with respect to some of the IT capital that I indicated, we\u2019re going to spend. Remember, we don\u2019t do the SAP to JDE Edwards conversion until January 1, so you\u2019re not going to see any of that benefit until we begin to harmonize the systems and get the staffing right, which will be the first calendar or second calendar quarter affair in 2012. And then the remainder of the IT capital, which we\u2019ll spend in 2012 and 2013 relates to box plant system.", "Operating systems Rock-Tenn has been on KOE it\u2019s a very, very efficient platform for managing your corrugated business and integrating financial information with your overall systems and it\u2019s also really good from a business and intelligent standpoint. Smurfit had started applying SAP to its box plant system and stopped. So really their systems are way behind ours and that\u2019s a \u2013 just a very detailed process, it\u2019s a 2012 process. So a lot of those synergies will follow mid-calendar 2012 and beyond.", "To quote the nearest range, synergy impact you\u2019re going to see is procurement synergies and energy synergies, which I think you\u2019ll start to see in the first calendar quarter of 2012 as I\u2019ve indicated. So I know I\u2019d love to be able to take the numbers that we\u2019ve achieved now and accelerate them, but there\u2019s just a lot of work to be done to generate those synergies, which will cause timing to be as I have just described.", "Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.", "That's very helpful. And some of your peers have talked about pretty decent trends in the first half of July in container board. I wonder if you saw similar trends and if anything has gotten worse in recent weeks just given the macro environment?", "James A. Rubright", "I think July looks to us a lot like June; the markets seem to be relatively stable, not robust, but stable relative to what we saw in June.", "Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.", "Okay. And then final question, what would you say, given the progress in the debt pay down, what is your leverage target at this point?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, I would be comfortable taking leverage down below two turns at that point, you really have to evaluate what\u2019s your optimal capital structure is, certainly based on what we\u2019re showing or going to deleverage at a more rapid rate than that and also for the couple of years, it was making relatively large pension contributions reducing our exposure to the unfunded pension liability.", "I don\u2019t have a firm target of what we would \u2013 what we\u2019re trying to achieve or in the level of which we\u2019d say we\u2019re beginning to be underleveraged.", "Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.", "Okay, all right, thanks, helpful. Good quarter.", "James A. Rubright", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Chip Dillon from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "Yes, good morning.", "James A. Rubright", "Hi Chip.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "Hey, Jim, first question for you. When you look at the \u2013 your strategic goals and potential acquisitions in the future, how long do you think you will sort of not be able to pursue those given the integration process? I mean do feel you\u2019re in a position in the next 18 months to do something that that strategically makes sense or is it more sensible to wait say the \u201813 or \u201814 after you've delevered a bit?", "James A. Rubright", "We continually evaluate opportunities and with respect to our ability to do another transaction, I would say we could do one tomorrow. We\u2019ve got a very, very efficient team in place, and all of people who were part of the ongoing organization are in place and we\u2019re working together. So I don\u2019t understand where the 12 to 18 months would come from. We're in a great financial position right now. If you have an idea that's good enough, somebody's going to finance it. We\u2019d able to come up with the financial structure that would work. So I don't view there as being any impediments to taking advantage of any strategic opportunity that might be available to us.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "Got you. And then looking at the deleveraging equation, it seems like next year with the big pension contribution you're making, and given that it's \u2013 and by the way, what is the expense Steve next year going to be? I know the contribution is 359, but what's going to be expense?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "", "57.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "157. Got you. So it would seem to me that.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "57.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "Oh, just 57? Got you. So it would seem to me that it would be difficult to see your net debt decline next year, say, more than what your net income is. Is that a fair statement given the capital spending being a little higher of the big contribution?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "We're just \u2013 we are not at a point of providing cash flow guidance. I think the details I went through should provide you the ability to come up with a projection for us based on your views of the market and other factors.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "Got you. And last quick one. When you look at the pension, and I don't see the slide, so I apologize if it\u2019s on a slide. But beyond 2012, how do you see the progress or the progression of pension contributions thereafter?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Probably somewhere at that same level for fiscal \u201812 for the next two to three years after that, I think, but it's really a function of what happens to interest rates and investment returns and if you can tell me what that's going to be, then let me know and we'll be able to make, some progress together. I mean it's just very determinate moving forward.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "(Inaudible) crystal ball.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Yeah.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "Okay, great. Well thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Mark Connelly from CLSA. Your line is open.", "Mark Connelly \u2013 CLSA", "Thanks. Just two questions. Jim, you know, we've certainly seen some examples of other container board producers successfully shifting an entire system to higher quartiles. I'm just curious if you can give us very broadly the way you\u2019re thinking about how you\u2019re going to approach that, maybe some sort of a rough split between your operational changes, new investment product mix, the big buckets just to get a sense of the strategy?", "James A. Rubright", "Yeah. I think in the near term, we got 100 million in improvements that come right off capital. I think that we've got that much that we could achieve over a 24-month period with operational improvements. We have a couple of examples of mills that where we had general manager changes relatively early in (inaudible) as opposed to later where they\u2019ve had a chance to get their team in place and then really starting down the road of operational excellence and based on those mills and the performance enhancements they've been able to achieve, I really think there's 100 million in performance improvement. I don't think that 200 million is the end of the game in terms of moving these mills to the web nor does it necessarily put a boundary on what we may be able to possibly achieve in the next 2.5 years with even better targeted investments.", "Mark, if you go back, we've all heard the story, but basically in 2006, 2007, Smurfit figured it had the money to fix one of its mill system or its Box Plant system and it fixed the Box Plant system and literally took 300 million of costs out with about 450 million of capital. They did not do it on the mill side so essentially you have a mill system that did not really modernize itself over relatively long period of time nor was it very successful with what I would refer to as continuous improvement or best practices.", "So the opportunities they are really pretty significant. But I think of the 200 million that's a component of the 400 million of the performance improvement that I've indicated is about half capital and half performance improvement and the upside would, I think, could come from either, but our ability to derive improvements off of capital are limited to a certain extent by just the physical ability of the people we have in place to execute capital projects. We're trying to build that infrastructure back, and we will do so, but we're starting with some limitations from that standpoint.", "Mark Connelly \u2013 CLSA", "Sure. That makes a lot of sense and just one question for Steve. It certainly does look like you've got your financial house in very good order. Are you likely to sit like this for a while or you antsy to get into the capital market to start rearranging debt maturities?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "", "We look at that (inaudible) I think for the next opportunity that we have is the 2016 notes we have coverable in March.", "Mark Connelly \u2013 CLSA", "Right.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "And I think right now based on the economics that would be called, I think, absent that, we're looking at the capital markets and I think you know that we've had a lot of floating rate debt over time, and that's been a good spot for us to be. We're about 80% floating rate. I think you saw the treasury come down and we'll continue to look at that and make the best judgment that we can.", "Mark Connelly \u2013 CLSA", "Okay. Super, thank you.", "James A. Rubright", "Thank you, Mark.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Steve Chercover from D. A. Davidson. Your line is open.", "James A. Rubright", "Hi, Steve", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Hi, Steve", "Steven Chercover \u2013 D. A. Davidson", "Good morning. First question just to simplistic, which I am. Could we infer that the accretion from Smurfit, the $0.23 in one month, that like $0.70 going forward without any other incremental synergies?", "James A. Rubright", "That's what we did. We just owned new assets we ran them and operated and normal operating conditions. That was the contribution earnings.", "Steven Chercover \u2013 D. A. Davidson", "Very good and my second question is, in your presentation back in January when you discussed the Smurfit deal, Solvay was virtually the lowest cost mill on the cost curve, and it's crept towards the middle is that simply due to OCC?", "James A. Rubright", "Recycled fiber costs.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Yes, exactly.", "Steven Chercover \u2013 D. A. Davidson", "Is there anything you can do to mitigate that because I mean it is still in a very good fiber basket so?", "James A. Rubright", "It is in terms of accessibility to fiber but actual that market index has moved up the New England and buffalo indexes have moved up relative to Chicago to a position where that's actually a premium for sellers of recycled fiber. The mill still is a great asset if you live in the middle of the cost curve in what is currently a pretty high recycled fiber environment you'll find. I think that the opportunities probably reduce the freight circle from the mill and increase the internalization and may be the optimization of great mix and so forth from the acquisition will be there because we've got a large Box Plant footprint in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic from the Smurfit acquisition. But it is going to limited by its position on the recycle fiber curve.", "Steven Chercover \u2013 D. A. Davidson", "Do you fear that the new mill because scared is going to build in buffalo is going, exacerbate that problem?", "James A. Rubright", "It's a big fiber basket and I don't know what strategy they're going take to fiber the mill so I don't really know the impact would I rather you not put another 400,000 tons in our marketplace, yes, but I don\u2019t \u2013 I think it's manageable.", "Steven Chercover \u2013 D. A. Davidson", "Got it. I guess ultimately this just indicates the strategy of growing virgin. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Your line is open. Mark, your line is open.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Can you hear me?", "James A. Rubright", "We can, good morning, Mark.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Okay good morning sorry about that. Just to clarify, the $0.60 in earnings that you reported that you know that you had made in June. Is that using a 55 million or 70 million shares in that calculation?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "It's 70.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "That is using 70 million?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "It's actually 71.6.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Okay. Wow. Okay. That's a lot of money in June. And then could you give us a sense in terms of the synergies that you think you may have achieved in June itself? I know you indicated the run rate at the end was 75, 80. Was maybe a third or half of that in June or some ballpark?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "No, most of the corporate synergies occurred on the date of the transaction, so the 28 million we probably had. I would say with respect to the administrative savings which were the last one I referred to, you might have had, a fair amount of that in the June month, but there's a lot of noise with respect to the rest, I don't think you had any.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Okay. And now historically, you used to provide earnings and cash flow guidance. Is that something that you're likely to revisit and this is kind of an exceptional period given having just acquired the Smurfit assets or going forward given that you got a lot more potential volatility in earnings stream is it something you're going to shy away from?", "James A. Rubright", "", "Well with respect to earnings, I've been here 12 years. And I think I stopped that as soon as I figured out what a bad idea it was. And that wasn\u2019t very long into my tenure, with respect to cash flow guidance; we did give cash flow guidance for a longer term view. It was, you know in the $650 million to $700 million range, which was a state-wide number for 2014, 2015. We're not changing that expectation. I think the cash flow generation ability this enterprise even at a higher cost environment is equal to that.", "But in the near term, we haven't decided either to update or to reconfirm more than I've just indicated what those numbers are. Given the impact on our business of price and input cost volatility we think it's better to give you the components of our cost structure and what we think we can do from an operating performance standpoint and then let you come up with a forecast for cash flow generation in the out years.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Fair enough. (Inaudible) So that 600, 700, I assume that's just the Rock-Tenn legacy business and now we have this Smurfit-Stone on top of that, is that correct? And you are just not at this point providing any thought process on the Smurfit-Stone led us to that?", "James A. Rubright", "", "Well the 650, 700 million was in annual basis of free cash flow for the enterprise. I think we had guided it at 2014 or 2015 when we had the synergies in place.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Okay.", "James A. Rubright", "", "Rock-Tenn's legacy EBITDA was $550 million in that baseline of $1.350 billion that we use for purpose and modeling the acquisitions the step free cash flow number was the combined enterprise after the pension contributions that Steve indicated.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Okay, so the 650, 700 EBITDA minus pension contributions minus capital.", "James A. Rubright", "", "It's after everything.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Okay, okay, okay. Fair enough. And so just maybe to flush out just 2012, 480 million in capital, I think 2014 you suggested you'd be trending down to the 350?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "We are going to be somewhere in between 2014 and beyond, I'm saying it\u2019s 350 is sort of the sustaining and cost improvement capital that you'd expect. 2013 we simply believe that'll be somewhere in between but we're far too early days in our planning to be much more precise than that.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Bill Hoffman from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Bill Hoffman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Hi, yeah, good morning.", "", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Good morning.", "Bill Hoffman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "", "I wonder if you can talk about, you mentioned keeping the system full here with exports in the last quarter. I just want to get a sense of what percentage of corrugated business was in the export market and then second question is just want to focus little bit on the consumer business obviously huge opportunities here on corrugated. But I just want to get a sense of trends that you're seeing in the consumer side as well as the merchandising business?", "James A. Rubright", "", "Let me answer the first part of your question then ask you to reask the second part. Our export volumes in the relatively short period of time that we had the assets was about 10% of total production, and it was up about 9% over the prior year period.", "So we're seeing good export demand and favorable pricing. And that's the answer to that question. If you don't mind, ask the second half of your question because I was distracted.", "Bill Hoffman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "That's fine. Just in the consumer business, you talked a little bit about trends in corrugated being decent in June coming into July. I just wanted to see if you're seeing any shift in trends in your consumer side of your business?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Consumers has basically been perplexing for us because if you look at the industry data, it suggests that folding carton volumes continue to be weak and down across the industry, yet our folding carton volumes are up. We know what ours are, and we have extremely strong demand for coated recyclable Paperboard, and we sell half of that, half of our production to other converters and consume half of it ourselves.", "So there's a disconnect between our experience and what we're seeing, including demand for underlying Paperboard and industry volume trends. So I'm a little perplexed. We feel like we're in a good business but the industry data would suggest that the business isn't as good as our experience.", "Bill Hoffman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "You think it's specific end market customers that you've got versus the broader market?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "I don't know.", "Bill Hoffman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Thanks. And I guess just final question in this recycling business, obviously a tiny business for you, but is that something you want to keep for the longer term? Is it something you might want to monetize at some point?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "I think (Inaudible) in all Smurfit was the recycling business not because of its current earnings generating capability but because of its strategic positioning for the mill system as well as if you assume that Chinese demand for recycled fiber is just going to continue to accelerate their need for US fiber which has a very high complement of virgin fiber in it will increase, I think, controlling a large amount of recycle supply in North America is going to have \u2013 it is going to be a good thing. I haven't really had this time myself to work with our recycled group to understand the profitability of the legacy Smurfit operations as well as I would like. Rock-Tenn was about twice as profitable as Smurfit and it\u2019s simply as plant operations and brokerage activities. And ultimately, we have to conclude, can we remake the Smurfit model to be more profitable, in the short-term which of course would it self be nice or are we playing a much longer term gain really enhancing the profitability of our mills because of our fiber positioning and taking advantage of what we think will be export opportunities. Those are questions that, your right to ask, but we're working on right now as one of our major initiatives.", "Bill Hoffman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Joshua Zaret from Longbow Research. Your line is open.", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "Thank you and good morning. First question; your current OCC exposure is bout 45%. You talked about some projects where you\u2019ll lower that exposure. What's your ultimate target for the OCC versus virgin mix?", "James A. Rubright", "I really don't have a target. I think we're talking about a shift of a couple hundred thousand tons and increased productivity of virgin right now. Those are things that we see the ability to do. I think as we move through beyond 2012 capital expenditures, into 2013 I'll have a much better idea of what we can achieve. But that's what we're doing in the short-term.", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "Okay. Two more questions. Next, you talked about throwing some capital at certain mills, you named some mills, I\u2019m just wondering if Jacksonville is targeted in this capital program.", "James A. Rubright", "We have two mills in Jacksonville, the Seminole mill.", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "The Seminole mill, specifically.", "James A. Rubright", "And Fernandina Beach, you said the Seminole.", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "Yeah, the Seminole mill.", "James A. Rubright", "Yeah, Seminole's are fine mill. We've got 220 inch recycle machines there. Clearly fiberring mills was a Rock-Tenn specialty recycled mills was in Smurfit. So initially I think we have the opportunity for performance improvement there that doesn\u2019t require a great deal of capital and the mill indeed I don\u2019t think does require a lot of capital, but it's certainly in our long-term plans.", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "Okay. So it is in your long-term plans? Okay. Thank you. And then finally, surprised someone ask this, but can we talk about OCC trends? Obviously, the price jumped maybe $15 a ton nationwide in July in a feeding frenzy? When we look at August, what are you seeing as a frenzy sort of diminished in anyway?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, yes. For starters the export price are down a few dollars. We really see demand sort of stable to weakening in August. It's hard for us to really forecast beyond what we see. But it's not heating up. Jim Porter's in China as we speak to me with a number of export customers there and surveying that market. And we understand that China is actually curtailing a lot of economic activity and we think that a number of the, what they don't call it coated recycle paperboard, but they\u2019ve got large production there, a number of those mills are going to be down. And I think that may moderate somewhat Chinese demand, but the long-term trends we think are for very strong demand and therefore pricing for US recycled fiber particularly OCC.", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "Okay. So if I were to say to you for August that I thought that the nationwide average would be up $5 to $10 in that range, do you think that's accurate.", "James A. Rubright", "It's not what we're seeing in the marketplace right now.", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "You're seeing more or less?", "James A. Rubright", "Less.", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "Less? Oh, great.", "James A. Rubright", "We're not seeing August up.", "Joshua Zaret \u2013 Longbow Research", "Okay. Great. I'm very surprised to hear. Some of your competitors are just, you know, are seeing the opposite. So that's great to hear. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Joe Stivaletti from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Joseph Stivaletti \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "I just had two small questions. One was, have you announced the plans for your bond maturity, the bond that matures this August, this month?", "James A. Rubright", "We're simply going to repay it from available cash.", "Joseph Stivaletti \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then you walked through a number of cash flow items. I just wanted to understand, though, away from the capital spending part of, I was wondering what your spending is expected to be in 2012 for the realization of synergies and performance improvements? You might have stated it, but I just wanted to clarify.", "James A. Rubright", "We haven't really broken it out. As I said there is $265 million of base-sustaining capital. And there is a fair amount of performance improvement capital in that and then a lot of just maintenance capital, and then the other specific items, I think you could all identify either to a synergy item as we indicated whether it's synergy or IT systems. They combine to be about $70 million, and then $45 million was really simply replacement of material handling stock that was leased.", "Joseph Stivaletti \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "But in terms of spending on an ongoing basis it's not CapEx related to achieve synergies and whatnot, is that\u2026", "James A. Rubright", "Yeah, I think we gave the number and it was $101 million, $135 million, and the timing of that, Steve, over the next two years, do we have a better view of when we're going to spend that or is it not\u2026", "Steven C. Voorhees", "We don't have a view to communicate right now.", "Joseph Stivaletti \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "So a 100 away from the CapEx that you outlined in a lot of detail, you at least spending roughly $135 million over the next two years?", "James A. Rubright", "In cash restructuring cost, right.", "Joseph Stivaletti \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. That's great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Chip Dillon from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "", "Yes. Thanks. Two quick follow-ups. The first one is, when you look at the Hopewell and Hodge projects, do you have other similar opportunities in your system that you could choose to do in later years?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, we do, but we haven't ground through really the economics of all the opportunity or, you know, done the higher level engineering that work to be able to prioritize them? But, can we increase the virgin mix of the mill system, yes, can we materially reduce this cost structure and increase its productivity, yes.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "And I guess the reason you're doing these two mills now is that either someone else had done the engineering or was it just so obvious that as you came in that those were the, that was the low-hanging fruit?", "James A. Rubright", "When we came to the table, Smurfit had a plan to improve the profitability of its mill system. We modified that plan somewhat, but the notion of doing work at Hodge and Hopewell was a part of that plan. I can't recall sufficiently the details of their plan versus what we ultimately were executing that, know the extent to which we modified it, but there have been some modifications.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "Okay. One last quick one. I know back in late '05, Smurfit-Stone announced a very major box fit upgrade. It supposedly ended just before they filed. As you'd gotten in there, it seems like maybe they did make some progress because all we've heard, you know is the fact that you\u2019ve shut down four plants and my guess is you really don't have any obvious further closures, you know, subject to what the market does. So have you found their system to be, you know, a pleasant surprise or about what you expected?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, let's go back, because I don't want to necessarily be seemed to have agreed with everything that you said. In connection with the announcement of the transaction, we said that the legacy Rock-Tenn box plant system could absorb ten at least average sized Smurfit Box Plants and an average size Smurfit Box Plant across their entire system is about 650 million square feet per year. So, we also said when these announced foreclosures that these four didn't logically line up with Rock-Tenn plants as the ultimate absorbers of that production or the majority of that production. I'll leave that there.", "Now, with respect to the Smurfit system itself, I have been to a number of plants, but not nearly enough to have personally in assessment of the overall asset quality, but other members of our team have. I think that they have a number of examples of just what we want to do across the entire system.", "Our legacy Rock-Tenn Box Plant system which obviously we had the lowest cost in the industry, because we had by far the highest margins I mean, the legacy Rock-Tenn EBITDA margins were 20%. You know with Solvay in the middle of the cost curve, so we\u2019ve got very little box plant cost and yet our average production is about 1.1 billion to 1.2 billion square feet in the course of the year.", "I\u2019ve visited several Smurfit plants that are over two. One plant we're investing some capital and to take it to 3 billion square feet. So we have plants that have really massive production capabilities and with that extremely efficient and low-cost systems. Now that\u2019s obviously not the case across the entire system.", "The other place I was very pleased were the quality and location of the display plants which fit very well with our plants.", "Now, there are a number of small Smurfit plants including those in Canada, which is resulted their geography are very nicely positioned in secure markets where they have the opportunity to make a lot of money. And then you have plants that are really not as well sighted and not as productive. So we\u2019re going to continue to work on the system.", "Frankly, I think Smurfit had done a lot, but clearly, we think there are examples out there of what we like the system to be and the opportunities to make it a much more profitable system exist.", "Part of the capital that we\u2019ve got in that 265 million continues to improve the productive capabilities of the plants and upgrade the box plant system as well. It's not outside of our focus or outside the anticipated improvements we believe we can make.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "That's terrific. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Mark Wilde from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Yeah. Jim, just a follow up on that. Can you talk about sort of in the first two months differences you've seen between sort of Smurfit's converting business and their customer mix versus what you had in Rock-Tenn?", "James A. Rubright", "I think the businesses from a customer standpoint are quite similar. They have a number of national account customers that we believe would be very attractive long-term partners for us. They have lots of local business as well, so I would say the similarities are greater than the differences in their overall mix of business with ours.", "As I responded to the gentleman before, I think their plant system is a very, let's say, desperate plant system, from very large plant severity to small plants with quite a few in between, but the geographic footprint to really provide opportunities in the market place for continued capital improvements and performance improvements.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "And what about sales incentives for guys who actually shoes on the street selling packaging? How do they vary between the two companies and what are you doing to bring them into harmony?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, today they don't vary at all. People are compensated on sales performance, which includes the profitability of the business that they sell.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, very good. Thanks.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Thank you. Just trying to get a sense of some of the puts and takes when we go to the third quarter. As you had indicated that June, the run rate was $0.60. Is it fair to say that Smurfit system probably didn't take a lot of downtime in June. I know they normally take quite a bit in April and May, not so much in June and also was Demopolis, was that downtime in April and/or May?", "James A. Rubright", "The Demopolis outage was in April and May, yes. so it didn't affect the month of June. Smurfit did, in fact, take a significant amount of downtime in April and May, but as I mentioned and you may have missed this, in June, they took what was about an average amount of outage downtime relative to the annualized total amount of outage downtime. We did not take any economic downtime in the month of June, because it is a seasonally strong period and as I\u2019d indicated we didn't anticipate that we would be taking any.", "Over the course of the year, the seasonally weakest period of time is November, December, and January into early February. So that's really the time when one would be concerned about running flow and balancing the system requirements. Outside of those months, the system should be tested if anything with respect to production.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Okay. So is it fair to \u2013 if we take the June and times it by three and we have the buck 80, then you're going to have additional costs related to any inflationary pressures. And that really should bate you the biggest differentiator from just taking the June and multiplying it by three. Is that a fair way to look at it?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, again, I don't want to comment specifically in that degree of specificity with respect to our forecasted earnings or cash flow. but what I would say as I try to go through in the beginning, there was no economic downtime in containerboard, coated recycle board, bleached paperboard, uncoated recycle board always has economic downtime, because the industry simply isn\u2019t full nor are we, although we didn\u2019t have significant amount there. And then the converting plants were simply meeting the market demand. Although, I think with respect to our folding businesses, as I've indicated, we've been gaining share and with respect to the containerboard business, our volumes were down more than the FBA data which suggested. And as I said, we\u2019re continuing to really sort through the overall business portfolio of the acquired operations.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from George Staphos from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. Hi, Jim one last question.", "James A. Rubright", "Sure George.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Smurfit at one point in time I talked about significant opportunities to optimize the grades they were making across their mills and machines and really tighten up relative to demand any one region go their Box Plants. Did you sense of this (inaudible) fairly large opportunity to reduce the number of grades and have the mills and the machines produce more akin to their sweet spot, and if so, how much of that is in your performance improvement target? Thank you.", "James A. Rubright", "There are some issues in the Smurfit systems that are endemic and they are mainly related to inconsistent quality across the machines and its \u2013 that is the limit or more than simply the physical ability of the machines to produce the Ideal grades. So we have been working with the teams at the mills to understand that we're going eliminate all of the quality issues. We're going make one consistent grade of quality across all of the machines and we're going back it with the capital that's necessary and they're going have to back it with the performance improvements that are necessary to do that, and yes it is baked into the performance improvement estimate of 100 million in savings. And it will eliminate one of the glaring issues with respect to that mill system. But these are solvable problems they just aren't going to happen overnight.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks again. Good luck in the quarter.", "James A. Rubright", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Thank you and I'm currently showing no further questions. I'd like to turn it back over to our speakers for closing comments.", "James A. Rubright", "We have no further comments. Thank you very much, all, for joining the call. We look forward to the opportunities ahead of us.", "Operator", "", "That concludes today's conference call.

Welcome to the MWV Third Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Jason Thompson. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jason Thompson", "Thanks, Keeley, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced our results before the market opened. The notification of this morning's call was broadly disclosed. And further, this morning's call is being webcast at mwv.com. Slides that accompany this call are available there as well. I'll briefly remind you that certain statements we make are forward-looking and are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties described in our public filings. Furthermore, contents contain time-sensitive information that, although correct today, may change with the passage of time. ", "All the results we show this morning are presented on a continuing operations basis. For the third quarter, we reported income from continuing operations of $117 million or $0.67 per share. Excluding special items, adjusted income from continuing operations was $121 million or $0.70 per share. ", "Now here to tell you more about our results for the third quarter are John Luke, Chairman and CEO; Jim Buzzard, our President; and Mark Rajkowski, CFO. I'll now turn the call over to John.", "John A. Luke", "Thanks very much, Jason, and good morning. For more than 2 years, MWV has delivered consistently higher earnings each and every quarter, reflecting the positive impact of our market-focus strategies in each business. We continued on this trajectory with another very strong performance in the third quarter. Our consistent financial improvement has come against the backdrop of an increasingly challenging economic environment. We have continued to make progress with commercial strategies designed to capture growth in targeted areas and to expand our market share, even in those markets where demand has softened. We have earned new business from customers by helping them attract and retrain -- retain consumers with innovative solutions. And we have capitalized on growth opportunities in emerging markets, such as Brazil and China, where growth is still strongly outpacing developed regions. Overall, we're delivering solid results while dealing with the same economic challenges as our competitors. ", "Our revenue increased 9%, and we generated record third quarter adjusted income from continuing operations of $121 million or $0.70 per share. Through the first 9 months of 2011, we have already surpassed the record annual earnings we delivered in 2010. Even with 2 uncertain months still ahead of us, this is sure to be another strong year for our company's financial performance. This is largely due to the progress we're making with our market-focus strategies including solid sales performance in our targeted packaging markets for food, beverage, healthcare, personal care, home and garden and tobacco. The dynamics in each of these markets vary, but it's fair to say that all have been impacted in some measure by cost inflation, lower consumer confidence and discretionary spending, especially in developed markets like Europe and North America. ", "For instance, inflation-driven higher food prices are causing consumers to change some of their buying habits, including choices about where to shop for groceries and which traditional and private label brands to buy. Consumers are also choosing new beverage products and formats over canned beer and soft drinks, and they're purchasing fewer discretionary items in the beauty and personal care categories. ", "Our participation choices in these markets have been shaped by increasingly deep expertise and diligent work to ensure that we are competing in the most attractive and least volatile categories with innovative products that are vital to our customers' brand identity and growth ambitions. As a result, we're gaining share because of our value proposition and market insights. ", "We've consistently stated that our performance is not immune to the broader economic trends, and it's not. But we're managing to generate profitable growth in our targeted markets in spite of uncertain and uneven demand. In fact, we have plans to grow our Packaging business even more aggressively in these markets, plans we look forward to showcasing and discussing with investors during the upcoming session we have planned in December in Richmond.  During that session, we'll focus on the elements of our growth model, including specific opportunities to improve our partnerships with customers, accelerate our innovation pipeline and expand our leading positions in emerging markets. ", "Before turning to Jim for more detail about our performance in each business segment, let me summarize by saying that across MWV, we have been executing our strategy and getting results for our shareholders. This strategy has transformed MWV into a global leader in the packaging industry. And our results in the third quarter, building on the success we have had all year, demonstrate not only the return on our strategy, but the confidence we have in our longer-term outlook. ", "I'll now turn to Jim for a report on our operational and segment performance. Jim?", "James A. Buzzard", "Thanks, John. The results from our businesses during the quarter were very good. We had combined segment earnings of $257 million, a 14% increase compared to last year and a record for the third quarter. Our 9% sales growth was driven by value-based pricing initiatives across our businesses and by the impact of foreign currency exchange from sales in Europe and Brazil. Our pricing mix improvement reflects strong execution of our market participation strategies and are an important part of our effort to grow the business and stay ahead of input cost inflation which accelerated in the quarter. We also saw solid productivity gains across our businesses from our streamlined asset base and operational excellence initiatives. ", "I'll now provide some details about the performance in each of our segments. Additional information is available in our press release and the slides that accompany this call. In the Packaging Resources segment, sales were up 7% in the third quarter, as we continue to generate strong pricing for paperboard in each of the packaging markets we serve. Overall shipments were down compared to last year for both bleached paperboard and Coated Natural Kraft. Our mix improved due to our end market strategies. ", "In Brazil, GDP has moderated from historic levels last year. Our corrugated markets are basically holding steady after dramatic growth in 2010. We recently began operations at our new box plant in Aracatuba, which will play an important role in our Brazil expansion plans as this gives us the ability to better serve the southern portions of the country near S\u00e3o Paulo. And our performance relative to competition in Brazil is very strong as we've been able to preserve our margins and maintain or expand our share in key markets. ", "Earnings in the Packaging Resources grew for more than $100 million during the third quarter, a continuation of the strong performance this year. And this includes $7 million in higher maintenance expenses and unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs related to the plant outage in our market facility. The improvement in earnings is primarily due to value-based pricing and strong underlying manufacturing productivity. ", "In the Consumer Solutions segment, sales increased by 5% during the quarter with the majority of the increase coming from foreign currency exchange and the addition of revenue from our acquisition of Spray Plast late last year. Pricing and product mix improvement in beverage, tobacco and personal care markets also contributed to increased sales. ", "In beverage, we're outperforming an overall downward trend in our core beer and soft drink markets in North America, and continued to make strong gains in Asia and Latin America. We play a key role as a partner for our customers who want to develop their brands through innovative packaging. And as we've noted previously, our machine replacements are up significantly in emerging markets where modernization in retail environment, increases in middle-class consumption and a focus on premium brands are driving demand for multi-pack beverage packaging. ", "The major driver of personal care performance was lower volumes of standardized pumps and dispensers in North America. There's also been a slowdown in luxury application in Europe due to the economic challenges which shifted our product mix slightly to the negative. In home and garden, the weather during the summer and fall lawn and garden season had a negative impact on our customers in North America. Both of these businesses continue to be impacted by the high price of resin, so our contractual agreements have begun to bring pricing in line with inflation of this important raw material. ", "Lastly in healthcare, volumes for our adherence packaging and medical dispensers were higher during the quarter as more customers recognize the value of our Shellpak adherent solution and qualify our pumps for preservative-free medical applications. ", "Overall, earnings in the Consumer Solutions segment were lower than the prior year, as we continue to deal with the temporary impact of economic-driven volume declines in some markets and the impact of the input cost inflation. ", "In the Consumer & Office Products segment, the recently completed back-to-school season in North America was a bit slower than last year but in line with our expectations. Our proprietary branded products performed well with retailers throughout the season, and we continue to grow our early learning products for students in preschool through second grade. ", "In our Office Products business, the timing of some shipments was affected by our effort to support key customers' merchandising strategies, resulting in slightly lower volume in the third quarter. In Brazil, sales are up and backlogs are strong as we prepare for the back-to-school season that begins in January. Solid early shipments to our customers in Brazil have contributed year-over-year growth during the quarter. Productivity improvements, as well as improved mix, drove higher earnings for Consumer & Office Products during the third quarter despite the shift of sales volumes in our Office Products business. We believe we are well-positioned for the busy planning and calendar season over the next few months as well as the back-to-school season in Brazil. ", "In the Specialty Chemicals segment, we continue to do well in global auto, inks, adhesives and oilfield markets. And as a result, we again have generated record sales and earnings in this business. Pricing was higher across all of our markets, which helped drive sales increases for carbon technologies and pine chemicals. ", "Auto carbon volumes were down slightly compared to the third quarter last year, as both North American and Japanese manufacturers continue to ramp production back up to levels seen before the earthquake and tsunami. Sales for our Evotherm warm mix asphalt additive were higher as more customers see the value of this innovative solution. And we're also benefiting from a focus on road maintenance and preservation in the United States. ", "But overall, our asphalt business has been impacted by the constraints on government spending, especially in China. We recently added new marketing capabilities in this area that will enable us to work with transportation agencies and our customers to introduce new and innovative technologies for the asphalt pavement market. ", "In Community Development and Land Management, we continue to generate sales of rural and recreational land during the quarter, including a large forest land tract in Georgia. Overall, we closed on approximately 15,700 acres, for gross proceeds of more than $30 million. The average price per acre of our small rural tracts was a very healthy $2,700. And the timber property we sold through TIMO was an opportunistic transaction in which we bundled several tracts together to maximize the total value. This strategy returned attractive pricing. Approximately 11,000 acres went for more than $18 million. ", "Given the real estate market, we're doing very well with the transactions that make sense for this business, especially in South Carolina. We're also completing planning and entitlement phases at each of our major development projects to be ready to take full advantage of the recovery, including activities during the quarter at our industrial park joint venture with The Rockefeller Group, our Master Planned Community in Summerville and East Edisto. ", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss some of our financial metrics for the third quarter. Mark?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Thanks, Jim. We delivered another quarter of record operating results by continuing to drive strong improvement across all key financial metrics. Third quarter highlights include a 24% improvement in adjusted operating profit, which, at $213 million, was a record for the third quarter; 13% operating margins; 160-basis point improvement compared to last year; and $250 million of cash flow from operations. ", "Our results clearly demonstrate that our market-based strategies are working, helping MWV outperform in an increasingly difficult economic environment. We are winning with our most profitable products in the most attractive market segments and efficiently translating our growing earnings into cash. With our strong cash flow, we are reinvesting to profitably grow our business and providing our shareholders with a strong dividend. ", "I'll highlight a few areas of our improved financial performance and then provide an outlook for the fourth quarter. Starting with the top line, our 9% sales growth was primarily driven by continued strong price and mix gains as well as benefits from foreign currency exchange. Our focus on commercial execution is driving value-based pricing gains and mix enhancement across all of our businesses, with particularly strong gains in Paperboard, Packaging and Specialty Chemicals. However, we did see some weakness in demand, particularly late in the quarter, as our customers responded to increasing uncertainty in the global economy and weakening consumer demand. ", "That said, our positions in growing, emerging markets and strong relationships with global brand owners helped us gain some share in several key packaging markets including food and beverage. Sales from emerging markets grew 8% in the third quarter and represents 27% of our total revenues. Adjusted EBIT in the third quarter grew 24% to $213 million, and our operating margins improved by 160 basis points year-over-year to 13%. Our improved operating margins reflect the strength of our business model, a powerful combination of higher-margin products, supported by a much lower cost structure and more efficient supply chain. ", "In addition to the 90 basis points of adjusted gross margin expansion, SG&A efficiency contributed another 80 basis points of improvement in the quarter. Our absolute dollar level of SG&A remained relatively flat year-over-year, as we increased sales and continue to invest in new product development and commercial capabilities that we expect will deliver profitable growth for our company in the quarters ahead. ", "Third quarter operating cash flow of $250 million was driven by higher earnings and good working capital management. For the full year, we continue to expect to generate strong free cash flow, which we define as cash after CapEx and dividends but before our Brazilian expansion in Covington boiler projects. Total CapEx for the year is expected to be approximately $720 million with roughly $400 million of that spend related to these projects. Our cash on hand increased to approximately $760 million in the third quarter, up nearly $90 million compared to the end of last quarter. In addition, the funded status of our pension plan remained strong at 145% despite volatile credit in equity markets. ", "Now turning to the outlook. During the fourth quarter, we expect to continue to make progress improving our business model by executing on our market-focus strategies, including pricing for value and optimizing our product mix, building strong positions in faster growing emerging markets and continuing to reinvest in our businesses to strengthen customer relationships and develop new products. This work will build on our strong year-to-date performance and enable us to achieve another year of record earnings in 2011. ", "With that said, underlying market demand will remain challenging through the fourth quarter and into next year due to ongoing macroeconomic events around the world. We also expect the recent upward pressure on key raw material prices to continue during the fourth quarter. In addition to this difficult environment, our 2011 fourth quarter earnings will be negatively impacted by an extended outage at our Covington paperboard mill and lower rural land sales compared to last year's strong fourth quarter. As a result, we expect MWV's fourth quarter earnings to be modestly below last year. ", "In the Packaging Resources segment, we are continuing to see uneven demand for paperboard packaging. Coated Natural Kraft order rates remain strong for this time of year, and we are generating solid demand in higher-value food, liquid packaging and beverage markets. However, we are seeing weaker demand in economically sensitive areas such as general packaging. We will continue to benefit from pricing actions taken over the last 12 months and from improved manufacturing productivity, with most of these gains offset by mid to high single-digit increases in cost for raw materials and freight. These factors, along with the negative impact from the outage at our Covington mill, are expected to result in slightly lower segment earnings compared to last year's fourth quarter. ", "In the Consumer Solutions segment, we expect profits to be modestly higher than year-ago levels, as we improve our pricing and product mix and recover higher resin costs through contractual price escalators. We expect solid demand for beverage packaging, especially in emerging markets and for healthcare packaging, as well as stable demand for personal care products. ", "In the Specialty Chemicals segment, we expect another strong year-over-year increase in profits. Demand is in line with prior-year levels, and we will benefit from continued price and mix improvements across our markets. However, inflation in certain raw materials and freight costs will partially offset these positive factors. ", "In the Consumer & Office Products segment, sell-in and sell-through of branded time management products for the planning and calendar season and back-to-school season in Brazil are the key drivers of fourth quarter results. So far, sell-in has been in line with our expectations. And as a result, we are expecting segment profits to be flattish compared to last year's solid performance. ", "In our Community Development and Land Management business, real estate market conditions make it difficult to forecast sales and earnings. And while we benefited from the timing of a large transaction in the third quarter, conditions remain challenging. As such, we expect land sales to be more in line with the levels we saw in the first and second quarters of this year. ", "With that, I'll turn it back to John.", "John A. Luke", "Thanks, Mark. To summarize, we remain confident that our market-focused business strategies will continue to pace MWV's success going forward. We continue to perform well in a difficult economy. And while we have noted that our financial results are not immune to the impact of global economic conditions, we do believe that we can continue to outperform the competition by executing on our profitable growth strategies across global markets, where the ones that we have targeted is the most attractive opportunities for our business. ", "This concludes our prepared remarks, and we'd now be happy to address whatever questions you may have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I jumped on the call a little bit late, so if you answered this already, I apologize, or discussed this already. First of all, as we look out to 2012 for Specialty Chemicals and the runway there, obviously, the management team has done a great job the last number of years improving the performance. But that makes now for tough comparisons in '12 and '13. How do you feel that -- what kind of tailwind do you think you'll have from emerging market infrastructure spending, which obviously has been a big driver for you, as many pulled back in that market? Secondly, there's been some discussion in the financial press about M&A in the energy markets or energy companies, how might that affect, if at all, some of the chemicals that you sell into oilfield drilling?", "John A. Luke", "It's John. I'll offer a few comments and then turn it over to Jim or Mark to follow up. First of all, as you noted, the team in the chemical business have done an exceptional job. And as a result, the year-over-year quarter-over-quarter comparisons have certainly been remarkable, reflecting the transformation of that business. It also reflects the opportunities that lie ahead. That said, it would not be logical to expect the same degree of year-over-year comparison going forward. But continuing to see outstanding progress given their strong market focus, not only in this country, you mentioned oilfield is an area where, clearly, we are looking to extend our possession. And you mentioned infrastructure spend in emerging markets. These are areas that have contributed, and we expect to continue to contribute to our progress as we move not only through 2012 but in the period beyond. Jim?", "James A. Buzzard", "And building on, I think the keys to the success of that business and the improvement in performance will continue to drive improved performance going forward. The innovative products that we come out with provide real value to our customers, we continue to invest in further innovation. So we'll see that pipeline continue to deliver benefits to the business. We really have a broad market participation. So while we might see weakness in one market, we can shift to another market and then continue with oilfields and adhesives to broaden in those end markets, and that will be helpful to us going forward. You referenced the emerging market presence, clearly, our presence in China, Brazil, increasingly in India, will help offset any temporary weakness we might see in more developed economies. And really, lastly, it is a team that has strong operating performance, and so they have a real leverage to drive further productivity and cost improvements. So I think all those things will come together to continue to help this business to grow.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, I appreciate that, Jim. I guess similar vein in trying to figure out -- or at an early stage, what the growth levers are for next year? What was -- what do you think the combined effect of the marked outage in Covington will be for 2011? And how much of that will you ultimately get back for '12? And in aggregate, again, with board prices here leveling off, and let's assume that, that is the case for next year, obviously, you can't comment on future pricing. What other areas might there exist to improve your earnings within PRG?", "James A. Buzzard", "So George, in terms of the outages, the marked outage is one that, I referenced in my comments, about $7 million of cost. That won't repeat next year but will pick up in '13. That's just a regular outage. The one at Covington is more substantial, and it represents probably about 40,000 tons of lost production in the quarter.  We fully will get that back next year and roughly $30 million of unabsorbed cost and maintenance expense. In terms of the opportunities, I think we continue to feel very good about our market participation strategies and so we'll continue to focus our commercial efforts on those markets where we provide real value and where we can expect you to pay for that value. That will just be a continued opportunity for growth in addition to the additional tons we'll get out of some of the improvement we're making at Covington.", "John A. Luke", "Yes. I would just append to Jim's comments, George, that at both mills, you continue to see enhanced market participation, enabled by a product mix, as well as the redesign of certain products. But in particular, in Covington, coming out of the outage we're taking this fall.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. Last one, and I'll turn it over quickly. Consumer Solutions was below our expectations. It's neither here nor there, but it seems like this has been a business that has never really, since Calmar, quite lived up to what you would've expected, you can agree or disagree with that. And do you think the volume shortfalls you saw in the third quarter were unique to you, or do you think everyone experienced that? And what do you do from here to improve the earnings on a more sustainable base so this gets to more of a 10%-plus operating margin, which is typical for Specialty Packaging businesses?", "John A. Luke", "Let me comment first and then turn to Mark and Jim. I think you've raised a very good question, but one that we can answer very much in the affirmative. We feel very positively about this businesses. Clearly, we are restless with the adverse impact of the incessant cost inflation that we have experienced, as both Jim and Mark noted most particularly in the resin area. But as we look at what we have done to continue to transform those businesses, to reshape them, to get the cost efficiency right and most important, to refocus in recent years the market participation strategies, building the commercial teams and supporting it with ever greater market knowledge and consumer insights, not to mention outstanding innovation efforts. We all feel very, very positively about the longer-term outlook for those businesses. Clearly, the 10% EBIT margin is a target for us. And that is what we're very, very much focused on, and we'll do that by participation. And as in the response to the chemical business, it's important to bear in mind that a lot of our opportunity in this business or in these businesses will come from the opportunities we see in the emerging market space as well. Jim, Mark...", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes. This quarter, we really did get squeezed, George. As you look at what's happened on input costs, as John mentioned, certainly, resins is a big part of that. We do have a lag in terms of recouping price through escalators in our contracts. And we do expect resin cost to be moderating. We do expect to see some margin expansion as that we catch up on the lag here in the fourth quarter. But longer term, as John said, it's really about our ability to develop new products and solutions in the marketplace around beauty, personal care, healthcare. And we're seeing some really good progress in that regard.", "John A. Luke", "Yes, and I would just come back and note that those of you who are able to come to Richmond in December for our packaging session will get a first-hand look not only at what we're doing, but most important, to better understand in much greater depth the strategies we have underway, the teams that are leading that work and the opportunities that we see.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I'm wondering if first, you could just kind of elaborate on which areas you saw the most slowing late in the quarter? Mark, I believe you mentioned something about that. So I was wondering if you could just give a little bit more color?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, I think we saw some slowing in the general packaging grades that are a little more sensitive to softening economic conditions. The -- that was probably the biggest area of accelerated softening in the third quarter, Phil.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, so nothing on the Specialty Chemical side?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "No. They've been pretty stable throughout. So that was more referenced to that part of our Packaging business.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got it, okay. And then just following up on the inflation question. Outside of resins, are you seeing any easing on any of the other raw materials or perhaps any incremental pressure on any of them? Maybe just give us some color as to whether 3Q would potentially be the peak in inflation, or do you expect this to kind of continue at these levels on a year-over-year basis heading into the fourth quarter?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes. Let me hit the highlight on that, and Jim, you can provide a little bit of color as well. But we do think we've hit a peak in terms of year-over-year impact. We were roughly 9% up year-over-year in the third quarter on energy, materials and freight. While still up in the fourth quarter, we do expect that trend to moderate down closer to the mid-single digits. But still, substantial inflation. And -- but there are a number of materials that are continuing to be stubbornly high in terms of their cost profile. And whether that's caustic, latex, titanium dioxide has also been pretty high. Jim, I don't know if anything beyond that. But it's still a pretty intense input cost environment, although we see it moderating slightly from what we saw in the third quarter.", "James A. Buzzard", "Well, I think you addressed it well, Mark. I think the other thing that we're really focused on is, how do we use these materials in the most efficient manner we can. So while we can't control the price on all of them, what can we do in terms of the amount that we used to produce our products and a lot of effort is going in to help moderate that.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got it, great. Okay. And then last question, just kind of following up on what George was getting at in terms of some of the moving pieces for next year. I guess how are you thinking about productivity versus investing for growth? I know in the second quarter, your productivity was negative because you were investing for growth. Now it's moved back to being positive this quarter, so it seems like you're focused a bit more on the savings. So as you look ahead, I mean, are you thinking about productivity next year again, or you think you'll reinvest most of that for growth?", "John A. Luke", "I think we'll -- Phil, it's John. I'll start and I'll ask the others to follow again. Clearly, we're always thinking about productivity working to improve the productivity of our operations and our overall organization mix quarter in and quarter out and we take that very, very seriously. We will continue through our organic efforts in the markets we've talked to, to leverage opportunities for growth, which we continue to feel even given the relative softness in the developed markets, most particularly Europe and the United States, that exist for us in places like Brazil, China, increasingly India, among other countries, where even with moderately slower growth, the upside opportunity still exists to be -- it exists quite nicely. We will invest beyond that in support of growth where those real opportunities for profitable participation pursue. But underlying all of that is a relentless focus on productivity.", "James A. Buzzard", "I don't have much to add to that. I mean, we clearly have developed a rigorous discipline that we carry across all of our operating entities, and we  will drive that just as hard in 2012 as we have in 2011. And as John said, we just see so many exciting opportunities for growth that we'll continue to invest in the platform to grow the business going forward.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. So I guess the net takeaway there is it should be probably a positive on the year-over-year on productivity, but you're still investing for growth, so some offset?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "You've got it, Phil.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.", "Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "A couple of things. First, can you give us an update on the rest of the Brazil project? I know it's hard to parse local economic activity down there versus FX, but I'm wondering how much FX is affecting your customers right now. And with respect to this project, you've got a fairly aggressive time frame. I'm just wondering whether this is already starting to affect both the cost and the benefits you're expecting?", "John A. Luke", "Mark, let me offer a couple of thoughts on that. First of all, let me just say at a high level, the project is being exceptionally well executed and we couldn't be more pleased with the job that the leadership of our team in Brazil with the help of others across our organization are bringing to the oversight of that. And at the same time, they're continuing to develop and in the early stage, as Jim indicated, execute very robust commercial strategies will -- that will support both growth but profitable participation in the Brazilian market.", "James A. Buzzard", "Yes. I think just building on that, obviously, this a major long-term investments. As John said, the team is guiding it and managing it extremely well. So we -- while this is a very aggressive time frame, we still feel confident that we will deliver as we have said. And then these markets have moderated a little bit, but we continue to invest for the long term down there, and we remain very positive on Brazil for the long term.", "Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And I wonder if I could just ask a similar question on Covington. You talked about the Q4 impact but I wonder if you could just give us a broader sense of that project and how we should expect that to play out?", "John A. Luke", "Jim?", "James A. Buzzard", "You'll begin to see that -- really the benefits not accruing until the end of 2013 and then fully into 2014. So we will continue to invest in it. We think it is absolutely the right strategic investment for that mill going forward. But it's going to be several years before we see the benefit.", "Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "But there's no change to the investment timeline? Sorry, it wasn't clear enough.", "James A. Buzzard", "No, there's not.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Gail Glazerman of UBS.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just going back to the demand comments, you talked about the weakening in the end of September. Is that something that's kind of plateaued at a weaker level? Are you seeing incremental pressure in October? And just generally speaking, any changes in order patterns that you're noting in general? I mean, you mentioned what you're seeing the consumer do, but I'm wondering what your direct customers are just thinking and doing?", "John A. Luke", "I think at a high level, what we've described is what we have seen. There is some moderation. It's been spotty. But as we look at what our customers are increasingly beginning to report or what we see from competitive announcements, there are indications of broader softness in certain consumer and industrial markets. And those are things that we're girding to be able to respond to. That said, as we've each commented, we have great confidence in the market participation strategies that we put in place that will, even in softer markets, let us continue to focus on those areas that are not immune to, but are less subject to, the volatility that we're beginning to see in the marketplace. Jim?", "James A. Buzzard", "Right. I think that's right, John. Part of what we're seeing, Gail, is a combination not only of softer demand by the end consumer, but our customer is also rebalancing their supply chains, pulling down their inventories as they experience the same thing we are. So at some point, that will diminish, and we'd expect to see maybe a little bit of moderating in terms of the declines, but as John said, it's very hard to predict what this economy is going to do around the world. There's lots of external events unfolding on almost on a daily basis. And we'll just have to play out. But we feel like we are well-prepared to weather any potential storm.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And looking at wage board, you're showing about 2 weeks of backlog, that strikes me as a bit low. Can you just tell us what you would view as normal for this time of year? And is that weakness mainly domestic, or is it global or exporter or both?", "James A. Buzzard", "At this time of year, going into November, 2 weeks is not bad. It's -- historically, we would expect between 2 and 3 weeks, so we may be a little light, but not bad from my perspective. And we frankly are seeing it across the board in all end markets right now.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And this was kind of touched on earlier, but I just want to clarify. CSG was dramatically weaker than kind of what you guided to last quarter. Was that surprise that resin cost didn't really come off the way you're expecting, or was it more weighted toward some demand surprise within the segment?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "I think it was a little bit of both. I think resin was much, much higher cost than we had expected. And we also saw a little bit weaker demand, as I said, particularly towards the end of the third quarter. So a little bit of a surprise on demand, much, much more stubborn cost profile for resin than we were anticipating at the outset of the quarter as well.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And just one quick last question. Are you still producing roll pulp at Evadale, or given the market change, has that become less attractive?", "James A. Buzzard", "We still are producing, and it's still attractive for us.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Mark Wilde of Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Could we get a little more color on some of the weakness that you talked about in the dispenser market, particularly kind of personal care? And then you also mentioned some weakness that you were seeing in the European high-end markets?", "John A. Luke", "Yes. Mark, let me comment at the outset. I think what we're beginning to see is not unexpected, most particularly in Europe, given some of the economic -- growing economic pressures that exist in that region is some of the impact of discretionary consumer choices that are being made. And what we see is in the higher-end fragrance market, the luxury markets, the greatest pressure earliest at a time of inflection like the present. But I think more broadly, we're just seeing a little bit more volatility in these markets where discretionary spending is a factor than we would under more normal economic circumstances.", "James A. Buzzard", "And clearly, in the pump business, we are seeing both reduced demand, as well as our customers, again, rebalancing their inventories to reflect the current economic reality. So that's impacting that in that business.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And what do you -- Jim do you have a sense in the -- like the personal care side of the business, is that just kind of consumers kind of working through what's in the closets rather than going out to the store and buying a new bottle of -- whether it's body cream or whatever?", "John A. Luke", "You could be right, Mark. I think that we will probably be much better equipped as we move through another quarter or 2 to provide a more analytical assessment of what is impacting consumer behavior and what it looks like. We're still at the very early stages of some of this -- what could be a softening in overall demand.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And in that business, is there any way kind of going forward you could provide us with a little more visibility into that dispenser business just in terms of sales or profitability, because it's pretty opaque from the outside, and it's, clearly, with Calmar and Spray Plast, it's been a market that you've put a lot of capital in over the last 4 or 5 years.", "John A. Luke", "Mark, I think that's a very fair question. First of all, we're going to be changing our segment reporting as we move into the new year. And that, hopefully, will give you not only much greater visibility into how and where we're participating, but it should also provide a better backdrop for questions of the sort that you're raising. And we'll look to provide that as appropriate.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. A few other questions. Jim, is the Covington project, is that going to roll into the first quarter as well? Do we need to factor something in our first quarter thinking in terms of outage costs or maintenance expense at Covington?", "James A. Buzzard", "No, we'll have it wrapped up by the end of this month.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then, John, it seemed like a couple of quarters ago when we met, that you were talking really about investing in some human capital to try to kind of develop business going forward. I just -- I wondered, with the slowdown that we're seeing globally, whether you're recalibrating that investment plan?", "John A. Luke", "The short answer is no, Mark. We're very optimistic about the longer-term opportunities we see. We recognize that in addition to capital and other investments we've made that continuing to upgrade the capabilities of our organizations, our organization and -- it to enable evermore successful execution in the market, as markets that we've targeted is going to be an important part of what we do. So -- and we have been very disciplined in how we manage costs across the organization to free up reserves to enable us to support those investments.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then the last question is just on mineral rights. I wondered if you could give us a little more color than what was in the release on the energy projects. And also let us know is, if you sell land like these sales to the TIMO in the in the third quarter, are you now routinely retaining mineral rights?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes. Yes, we are. And Mark, with respect to the natural gas rights, we're still in the process of having test wells drilled. So there's no update on the progress of that. But they are continuing to drill wells and more to come.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. When would you think, Mark, that we would have some more visibility into kind of that situation, what the potential there might be?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "We'll have better information at some point next year, for sure.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I mean, is that first quarter, third quarter, do you have any sense?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Some point, hopefully, by the first half, Mark.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to the line of Mark Weintraub of Buckingham Research.", "Mark A. Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Since you guys do have a fairly good global perspective, I just wanted to go back a little deeper into the comments you're talking about, demand weakening a little bit. Are you seeing much difference geographically? Is Europe slowing more than, say, North America, or you're not really picking up that differential?", "John A. Luke", "We'll have more as we move through the balance of this year, more definitive data to report. I think anecdotally, it would be fair to say that we've seen Europe softened to a greater degree than the United States and North America at this stage of the game. It's all relative, but the amount of noise and financial challenge that has impacted not only the financial markets but consumer confidence and behavior in Europe has necessarily led the way in the current move toward softness in demand.", "James A. Buzzard", "And as Mark reported in his comments, we continue to see growth in the emerging markets and our participation there is a real help to us. But that has moderated slightly as well.", "Mark A. Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. And just following up on the Rigesa project a little bit. Two questions. One is, given the changing currency, does that affect the expected capital costs in, at least, in dollar terms for that project? And also, the customers that you're selling boxes to, are they largely keeping the products that they're selling within the country, or does a lot of that get exported?", "John A. Luke", "Yes. Let me get the first part.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, On the currency certainly, as that fluctuates, the dollar amount, the translated dollar amount, will change as well. So if the real strengthens, it's reflected as a higher cap spend, if it comes down, which as recently, it shows lower capital spend. But as you will recall, we also have some real-denominated debt that we're using to finance that project as well as cash. So both sides of the balance sheet will see that impact.", "James A. Buzzard", "Mark, in reference the second question in terms of where most of our boxes wind up. They actually -- vast majority if it winds up stay within Brazil.", "Mark A. Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. So your customer keeps their product in Brazil?", "John A. Luke", "Yes. And I think Jim -- while Jim is spot on, we do sell corrugated to some firms that have built large positions in the export marketplace, particularly in the food sector. And we've seen, obviously, with the currency change there, some retrenchment in that activity.", "Mark A. Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. And I think I heard $720 million number for -- that was for 2011 cap spend, is that correct?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "That's right, Mark.", "Mark A. Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "And do we have a sense of where 2012 is going to be at this juncture?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, it'll be lower. We'd expect that to be lower as the Rigesa project comes to a conclusion in mid-2012, but we'll also see some ramp up in Covington. But all-in, lower total cap spend in '12 than we're expecting for 2011.", "Mark A. Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "I think at one point, you had suggested that '11 and '12 combined might be about $1.2 million to $1.3 million? Is that still a good number, or has that changed a bit?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "That's in the ballpark, Mark, yes.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Alex Ovshey at Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Can you comment and potentially quantify what your SBS and CNK prices did sequentially from the second quarter of '11 to the third quarter of '11?", "James A. Buzzard", "I don't have that number directly. We'll get back to you with that.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Jason will follow up with you on that.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And there was a price increase for September on CNK. Any update on that?", "James A. Buzzard", "I mean, we continue to work through the marketplace to implement that price increase.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. High level as you guys think about the Packaging business, what part of that business is exposed to the more defensive food and beverage end markets versus the general packaging end markets where you're sighting some weakness?", "James A. Buzzard", "Well, clearly, in the -- in our CNK business, the Paperboard business, we are well represented in the food and beverage markets. And obviously, we also serve a lot of other markets from those mills. That will be a defensive position for us for sure.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Is it more than 50% of the total Packaging business?", "James A. Buzzard", "Yes.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And the -- so the Covington mill has been taken down in October. It's down right now for the CapEx maintenance?", "James A. Buzzard", "We did not take the entire mill down. So it -- we have our recovery board out that's going through maintenance. And we're rotating the machine down one at a time.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Do you have a sense what that downtime end up doing to your SBS backlogs over the next 4 to 6 weeks if you hold demand constant at where it is today?", "James A. Buzzard", "I mean, we would expect that they would increase slightly, but we've obviously been supporting our customers throughout this time frame with inventories as well.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, got it. And just the last question. Really nice cost control on the corporate line. Any incremental guidance that you can provide us on how to think about that corporate line expense for the entire year 2011?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Alex, yes, I think we were a little high in the third quarter. We saw that moderate in the second quarter, saw that moderate here in the third quarter. So I'd expect to be somewhere in between, but closer to where we were in Q3 than Q2.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Chip Dillon of Vertical Research Partners.", "Chip A. Dillon", "I know this bounces around a lot, but it seems like the corporate expense, the adjusted numbers on Slide 16 are quite low. And I didn't know if you could just help us understand that and give us some context as to how you see this sort of adjusted corporate number looking in 2012?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes. If you will recall, Chip, in the second quarter, as a result of a much higher stock price, we had a number of charges in there for equity -- long-term equity compensation. And they were noncash charges. In the third quarter, as that stock price has gone down, we saw the benefit of some of that. So we're probably looking at a run rate spend that's somewhere in between. So we saw $12 million to $13 million of noncash charges in the second quarter, and we saw somewhere in the neighborhood of $12 million of that reverse in Q3. So somewhere in between is what I would guide you to.", "Chip A. Dillon", "And while we're sure looking at this area, do you have an early read on your pension line? I mean, as you -- of course, your company has been very different and very positively comported on the pension line with the income. Any reason to expect that $20-ish million per quarter rate to change in 2012?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Not substantially, Chip.", "Chip A. Dillon", "Got you. Okay. And then the last thing is, as we look at your interest expense, I would imagine as we go quarter-to-quarter, you probably are increasing the capitalized amount especially as you get more progress down in the Rigesa project. Can you give us an idea just sort of how that could -- if it's material, will it continue to move up? And sort of when does, I guess, that in 2013 is when we would expect to see that capitalized number come down. And can you just give us some magnitude on that?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes. It was about $4.5 million in the third quarter, $15 million to $18 million over the full year for the Rigesa project.", "Chip A. Dillon", "And you would think next year, that's probably in 20s, maybe even $30 million?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "No, no. I'd say it's still on that $15 million to $18 million range.", "Chip A. Dillon", "And then comes down, obviously, in '13 as you start up?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions that I show in queue.", "Jason Thompson", "Thanks, Keeley, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Keeley, if you could please read the replay information? Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Rock-Tenn\u2019s First Quarter Fiscal 2012 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.  (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, slides are being presented today as a part of the conference call.  These slides can be accessed at www.Rock-Tenn.com under the Investor Page.  Ladies and gentlemen, this call is being recorded today, January 25, 2012. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.", "Your speakers for today\u2019s call are Mr. Steve Voorhees, Chief Financial Officer; and Mr. James Rubright, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  Mr. Voorhees, you may begin your conference.", "Steve Voorhees", "Thank you, Gweney.  Welcome to Rock-Tenn first quarter 2012 conference call.  This is Steve Voorhees, Chief Financial Officer.  I'm joined by Rock-Tenn's Chief Executive Officer, Jim Rubright.", "During the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events.  These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discuss.", "We include a description of these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the SEC including our 2011 Form 10-K.  During the call, we may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. We provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of this slide presentation, which is also available on our website.", "Jim is going to begin with a commentary on the performance of our businesses during the quarter, and then I will discuss the progress we're making on capturing synergies as well non-operating items in our financial statements. After our prepared comments, Steve and I will be available for questions.  Jim?", "Jim Rubright", "Thanks Steve.  We reported $1.18 per share in adjusted earnings in a period marked by lower export demand and pricing and falling pulp pricing.  In addition, our earnings were lower than the sequential period as we expected due primarily to the combined effects of seasonality because the period from mid-November through January is our seasonally weakest period particularly in the container board business, and the major maintenance outage expenses that we incurred in the quarter as we had no major maintenance outage expenses in the September quarter.", "These seasonally market factors primarily impacted our Corrugated sector where our earnings declined $0.39 per share.  We continue to maintain our progress integrating Smurfit-Stone acquisition and even though our corrugated segment earnings were down sequentially the acquisition was still $0.15 per share accretive during the quarter.", "Consumer Packaging was down about $0.03 per share as lower recycled fiber prices and natural gas costs had a greater proportional impact in offsetting seasonal weakness in that business.  Our Recycled earnings were down about $0.01 a share since recycled plant margin normally compress in a period of fall in recycled fiber prices.  Steve will detail the changes in both expenses in Other that we show slide 6.", "Our trailing 12-month EBITDA, credit agreement EBITDA was about $1.3 billion and free cash flow at $64 million for the quarter as we used substantial funds to build primarily container board inventories and to fund our pension plans as we detail in slide 8.", "As you can see, we generated $307 million in cash from operations.  This of course is non-GAAP number but it is in fact the cash available for the uses that we've shown.  The largest of the ongoing uses were $82 million in capital expenditures, $69 million in pension contribution in excess of expense and $69 million of billed container board inventories as we discuss to support our planned outage use in the spring.", "In addition, we paid $89 million to acquire Corpak, and we paid $13 million to Smurfit\u2019s former CEO, which was an acquisition related payment that had to be differed for six months under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.  Steve will comment later on the proceeds from property sales, all of the resulted in net debt increase $31 million in the quarter.", "As I mentioned, Corrugated segment earnings reflected the seasonality of our business and major maintenance outages, as well as a significant production loss that at our West Point white top liner board mill that was caused by a power failure, which combined to reduce container board production by 81,000 tons in the quarter.  Our segment earnings was $16 million lower due to container board sales volume, $13 million lower and lower export and pulp prices, $14 million lower from seasonal sales mix changes, which I will detail, and were about $14 million higher due to softening commodity input prices from primarily recycle fiber.  We detail these changes further in slide 10.", "Commenting on our seasonal converting sales mix generally in the December quarter, we have a higher proportion of sheet sales, which have lower margins and a higher proportion of sales, the national count direct merchandisers, which are driven by the holiday season. These mix changes should reverse as we move out of the second fiscal quarter particularly into the third and fourth.", "Our overall converting volume trends were positive with converted product shipments up 5% over the preceding quarter on a per day basis and up 2.6 % Q1 fiscal '11 on a per day basis.  Over the course of the year, we exited about 2.5% percent of our total box volume on the basis of pricing decisions that we made in rationalizing the Smurfit business portfolio, although we had replaced most of these volume by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2012.", "Our Consumer segment continues to perform very well with segment income down only $2 million in our seasonably weakest period.  EBITDA margins increased 90 basis points primarily due to lower recycled fiber costs.  Segment income increased $9.3 million over the prior year quarter.  About two thirds of that was earnings from former Smurfit display plants that are now included in our consumer segment, and one third was from higher sales and operations improvement in the legacy Rock-Tenn business.", "We did take some unexpected economic downtime in our Stroudsburg mill this is an 80,000 ton per year coated recycle mill that produces especially greater paperboard that substitutes for coated natural craft in many applications.  Our four other folding carton and recycled board mills did not take any economic down time in the quarter.", "Our Merchandising Display business continued to have very strong sales and very good results.", "Our outlook for the second quarter and the balance of the year is tempered by the possibility of continued weakness in the export markets, although we do believe these markets have bottomed and we see evidence of improving pricing, as well as through continuation of highly competitive domestic box markets, which in turn assumes essentially flat domestic demand conditions.", "While we expect the benefit in January and February from lower recycle fiber costs, our expectation is that recycled fiber prices will trend up over the balance of the quarter reflecting the passing of the Chinese New Year.  But ultimately recycled fiber prices and a potentially significant benefit to Rock Tenn will depend in large part upon the strength of returning Chinese demand.", "We are now taking economic down time in our container board sector in the second quarter due to the export market conditions I have described, and again some economic down time in our Stroudsburg specialty coated recycled board mill to match up with our customer demand.", "We expect to take major maintenance outage down time of about 47,000 tons in the second quarter which is about the same as what we took in the first quarter and then in the third quarter we will take about 145,000 tons and none in the seasonally strongest fourth quarter.", "Our needed inventory bill will continue in the second quarter bringing it to a peak at a total of about 150,000 tons and then that will unwind completely in the third quarter.", "Given where we are in integrating the Smurfit acquisition and the schedule of capital deployment particularly to improve mill operations and assuming that all other things are equal to our view today over to the conditions we are experiencing today, we do not expect to see significant earnings improvement until the fourth quarter of \u201912 in the first and second quarters of \u201913 when we complete our major projects at our Hodge and Hopewell Mills, and until we have addressed some of the legacies of the Smurfit mill performance issues.", "The Hodge and Hopewell projects themselves which I have spoken on about -- combined to about a 140 million of the projected capital cost we forecast in 2012 and 2013 these projects are very high returns averaging in the approaching 40% and as viewing them on the most conservative basis as possible which is looking solely at direct mill production costs and assume no other major changes in our mill system.", "We also expect to continue to employ the capital.  We said for spending to remedy the basically legacy performance issues in the Smurfit mill system is about $100 million of that capital in 2012, and we are confident that that will resolve a number of the production and quality issues that we are experiencing that have been affecting the profitability and cost structure of the segment, particularly in the most recent quarter.", "In addition, we will continue to run higher than normal staffing and business transaction cost as we continue to optimize our box plant system then higher administrative and IT costs as we execute a major systems integration changes we discussed.  These IT projects involve the SAP and JD financial system conversion for this Smurfit business and conforming all of this former Smurfit box plants to Rock-T's IT operating system model.", "It\u2019s really not practical to segregate all of these cost and showing adjusted earnings, and we have not attempted do so, and we can\u2019t capture the related synergies until these projects are all completed later this year in the case of the Hodge project and next with respect to the Hopewell project and the realignment of the financial systems in the box plants.", "These factors combine to support our view that the primary integration and performance benefited the integration of the acquisition will show up in the fourth quarter 2012 upon completion of the Hodge capital project and a number of the maintenance projects we will do during our major maintenance outages in the second and third quarter.", "And then, again in Q2 of 2013, which will be upon completion of the Hopewell project and the completion of the financial system box plant changes I've described and again, the continuing benefit of maintenance capital and box plant plan realignments that we are putting in place today.", "That concludes my operating comments, and Steve will now discuss progress on synergies in certain financial matters.", "Steve Voorhees", "", "Thanks, Jim.  I'm going to start with the progress we've made on the integration.  The run rate of synergies and performance improvements increased by $23 million in the quarter to an annual rate of $133 million.  We've broken out the $133 million between synergies and performance improvements.", "Synergies are profit improvements that are a direct result of the combination of the companies.  Performance improvements are profit improvements that we\u2019ve achieved, and that do not flow directly from the combination.", "Our synergy run rate was $109 million and our performance improvements include $15 million from box plant closures and $9 million from staff optimization, primarily at the containerboard mills.", "Going forward, we will continue to report our progress toward achieving our synergy target of $150 million by the end of calendar year 2012.  We continue to expect to achieve performance improvements of $400 million by the end of calendar \u201813, which is two and a half years from the completion of the acquisition.", "Quantifying these improvements and separating them from the other changes in our business over time was a distinction without a substance to difference.  The same is true for the non-capital expenditures necessary to achieve the performance improvements, all of which have been captured in our aggregate capital expenditure guidance of $480 million declining to $500 million for the year, declining to a run rate of $350 million in fiscal 2014.", "As such, in the future, we want to report performance improvements and the associated capital expenditures except for discrete items, but rather reflect these items in our reporting of normal operating results.", "Through the end of December, we spent $56 million of the expected $130 million in cash restructuring cost.  The $130 million includes what we expect to incur for all the box plant closures to-date and the cost to integrate our administrative processes.  We expect that most of the remaining $74 million in cash restructuring cost will be incurred during fiscal year 2012.  Our conversion from Smurfit-Stone\u2019s SAP financial system to JD Edwards will be completed at the end of the March quarter, a significant milestone that will allow us to move closer to completing the administrative portion of the integration activity.", "Many of our box plants have been collaterally located on sites that have proven to be valuable for other users.  To-date, we have received proceeds from the sale of real estate and other assets of $13 million, and our current estimate for total proceeds from the planned closures to $66 million.  This will offset about half of the cash restructuring cost.", "Turning to our key cost inputs, wood cost increased compared to the September quarter by nearly $1 per ton.  This is in line with seasonal patterns, and was more than offset by the decline in recovered fiber prices by about $30 per ton in the quarter.", "We have benefited from the continued decline in natural gas prices.  The twelve-month NYMEX stood at the time of our last conference call was $3.92.  Today it\u2019s approximately $3.", "During the first two weeks of January, we converted our Stevenson mill from using fuel oil to generate steam to using natural gas to generate steam.  This is replacing approximately 10 million gallons of fuel oil per year with 1.5 Bcf of natural gas.  At today\u2019s prices, this benefits to mill by over $10 per MMBtu or $1 million per month.", "We are converting the boiler systems at three more of our mills from fuel oil to natural gas.  Like contracting with local gas marketers and distribution companies to our natural gas lines to the mills.  The dollar savings are significant.  We expect the West Point Hopewell and Fernandina Beach Mills to replace fuel oil with natural gas by the end of this calendar year.  Including the Stevenson Mill, the four projects will replace approximately 36 million gallons of fuel oil per year with 5 Bcf of natural gas.", "We expect that the total natural gas conversion project cost of the four mills will total approximately $25 million, of which we spent $2 million to-date.  We estimate the annual benefits from these projects at current prices to be $45 million to $50 million.", "We should realize the full run rate to savings in fiscal year 2013.  We have included these R&D projects in the performance improvement targets we previously mentioned.", "At the Solvay Mill, we recently entered into an arrangement with the current steam provider that will enable us to terminate our existing steam supply contract later in this fiscal year and enable us to transition from coal to natural-gas based steam for the mills.", "We will receive an amount of money from our counterparty that will fund our acquisition in construction of a natural gas package boiler plant.", "The existing steam supply contract at Solvay would have run through 2018, with the cost of coal and the environmental cost and uncertainty of our coal based steam supply, and considering the availability of natural gas supply from the Marcellus shale.  This is a very good deal for Rock-Tenn.", "Turning to our guidance on certain financial statistics, there were no major changes to the first three line items on the slide as compared to what we provided you on our last conference call.", "We continue to estimate depreciation and amortization for the year in the $550 million range and corporate and interest expenses for the March quarter to be $26 million and $32 million respectively.", "Our book tax rate for the first quarter was 38.3%.  The tax rate was six-tenth of a percent higher in the first quarter due to the one-time adjustment to deferred state income taxes rising from the Corpak acquisition.", "We currently expect our book tax rate in fiscal year 2012 to be between 37% and 38%.  Our cash tax rate would be substantially lower as we use our available federal net operating losses and other tax credits on our books to offset cash taxes.  Unsold or unused tax items aggregate to approximately $388 million and reduce future federal cash taxes.", "You may have seen that Capstone recognized $63.6 million tax benefit following an IRS audit in which its position that slack liquor products were not taxable was accepted.  Rock-Tenn has $254 million tax reserve that we will reserve to receive the same outcome in our loss.", "As we disclosed on our last conference call, we have conformed the accounting for major maintenance outages and the legacy Smurfit-Stone mills to Rock-Tenn's policy of recognizing the expense ratably over the period from the time incurred to the next scheduled outage.  Since we started accumulated the expense recorded in connection with acquisition there was only $2 million of maintenance outage expense recognized from the September quarter.", "In the December quarter, we recognized $6 million in maintenance outage expense.  This expense will increase as outages occur.  We expect this expense to increase to $17 million to $19 million in each of the last two quarters of this year.", "At the end of September, our net debt was $3.4 billion and our credit agreement debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.7 times.  Liquidity was $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter including the $227 million of new funding from the term A2 that we completed in December of 2011.  This liquidity is more than adequate to support our business as well as to fund the plan called for $300 million 2016 9.25% notes in the March quarter.  Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity are in very good shape and are able to support the business. ", "That concludes my planned remarks.  Jim and I are now available to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions).  Your first question comes from Philip Gresh, JPMorgan.  Your line is open.", " ", "Philip Gresh - JPMorgan", "Just thinking about on the quarter and the results they're obviously there below the Street, seems like may be some of that was seasonal, may be the Street is a little high for that, but what would you say in the actual results in the quarter kind of surprise you relative to what you initially thought?", "Jim Rubright", "Well, we don\u2019t give specific guidance as you know, but that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t model the business.  Phil, we are pretty familiar with your model, and I think we were pretty consistent in our view with respect to where the quarter would come out until the export just fell out a bit which really happened in about October.  I don\u2019t think people appreciate fully the extent of that for Rock-Tenn.  I mean, proportionately we are the largest exporter, and we export a lot of white top.  And when you lose that it's disproportionately adverse because of the higher margins we've got on white top line or then brown.", "We were faced with a situation in which a couple of European but very large international supplier fired lawsuits essentially its European demand and came in and took the Middle East markets out in that ultimately corrupted Latin America. So we look, you know, we had a choice to essentially follow the pricing behavior down or just draw the line and we chose to draw the line. So, we take quarter over quarter -- yeah, the year-over-year quarter in Q1 2011 we exported about 15% of our total container board production; in the first quarter 2012 we exported about a 11% of our total production and, as I indicated, we lost a fair slug of white in that process. So that was really the major driver for us.", "The second thing is with respect to I will come back to what we were seeing in the export markets by the way, but with respect to modeling our business with significant reduction in recycled fiber pricing but as you noted our benefit from fiber the $15 million is just less than what you get if you multiplied recycled fiber by the average index change over the quarter.  There are several effects.  First, you got seasonally higher wood cost which firstly offset it.  Secondly, about 15% of the net benefit in OCC reductions are going to be lost because of the reduction in the price that you get for DLK, and then third, we have a just an inventory and in transit issue which ultimately cost about six or somewhere between $6 million and $7 million of the expected reduction if you just multiply recycle fiber price and then the remaining about $5 million of benefit that we didn\u2019t show up was a function of just regional index changes versus Chicago OCC. So I think it\u2019s very hard for your guys to model them without having going through a quarter like this one but those with the two major impacts.", "Now, commenting on what we see on both of them, frankly the time period in which to really judge where recycle fiber is going or probably February and March as we really understand the impact of returning Chinese demand following Chinese New Year you know, price of the China are up a little bit but frankly our view is that its going to of return somewhere between where it is to possibly as high as it was at the end of the last year by the end of this year.  The extent of the return of Chinese demand will really materially impact the possibility that earnings could be better than we are suggesting if you don\u2019t have a return to that level of peak OCC pricing.  We don\u2019t see it today but OCC pricing is volatile and difficult to predict.", "We have also in our guidance taken a pretty bearish view with respect to export volume pricing essentially saying it is little change from the current market.  That may be bearish given what we are seeing.  Actually the most recent market feedback we are getting very much supports the fact that we bottomed and are seeing various pricing opportunities in the marketplace. Certainly the market feedback, we are getting with respect to pricing is little more positive and, as I indicated, with our major markets we really held the line in Latin America and because of the large share we have got there and I think our customer relationships with essentially, I think maintain pricing better than the spot pricing in the marketplace and order are firm there,", "In addition, in Latin America, we had a number of orders that we turned away on price that ultimately that people placed orders with producers who didn\u2019t produce and ship. So some of those orderings that are starting to filter back to us as people need the supply and where the more of the reliable supply on that market.", "So all of these things combine to tell me that we had a pretty distressed period of time in the fourth calendar quarter, our the first quarter, and that they may improve significantly over the course of the balance of the year, but we are not building significant benefit into the guidance we gave earlier. In addition, even if it does improve, it is going to show up way in this quarter and second quarter that we're through January now and if you, by the time those order pass through ultimately show up in sales, you really out in our fiscal third quarter.  I would say that definitely the markets bottomed and now the question is just how much is it going to improve and just what that they will do expect out there.", "Philip Gresh - JPMorgan", "Okay, thank you for all the color there.  I guess my final question is just as we look at the quarter ahead, it sounds like, if I'm reading what you are saying correctly, the synergy run rate next quarter might actually be below what we saw in the first quarter, just because of the timing of your projects.  And then falling under that is the seasonal mix may also not come back until the following quarter as well. So am I right about that?  And if so, does that mean you know, we should be thinking about profits being down quarter-over-quarter next quarter just kind of be very explicit about it?", "Steve Voorhees", "It\u2019s difficult to model within that degree of precision and as I say we don\u2019t really attempt to try to give specific earnings per share guidance.  With respect to the issues you raised, yes.  With respect to the second question and that is the seasonality will reserve over this quarter, because really you don\u2019t come out of it through a lot of January and the mix change is particularly getting out of the sheet mix and so forth, a lot of that you will see in the second quarter.  So from the timing standpoint I think you are reading that right.", "I don\u2019t expect the synergy run rate to be lower than it was in the first quarter. I think it\u2019s basic what we are seeing as we think that\u2019s going to be essentially flat, because we will get some incremental procurement savings, but not a lot, and really that the major drivers of the synergies and operating improvements as I mentioned we will show up in Q4 \u201812 and then Q2 \u201813.  But we still have a clearly high degree of confidence with respect to the returns we expect out of those projects in what we\u2019re doing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from George Staphos, Merrill Lynch.  Your line is open.", "George Staphos - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks for all the color on the market factors and export, and obviously, it was a challenging market more so than we would have modeled.  I guess were there any execution issues from the way you were in the export portion of your business and that maybe caused you some performance or was it purely just the market, as far as you could see?  That was my first question.  Second question, could you quantify for us how much impact you had from the West Point outage?", "Jim Rubright", "Yeah.  The West Point and the export markets are related because West Point is an export market mill for some of the white top.  And the total cost of the West Point outage was in the range of $5 million.  We had both production loss and expense.  So it was a pretty significant factor that I could explain you what happened, but it was basically a reactor failure and it just shuts down the mill.  It\u2019s just a small thing, it has really big consequences, and so we had to fix it and put it the way it should be, which we did in the quarter, but it was fairly expensive.", "George Staphos - Merrill Lynch", "Okay.  And in general, just in export overall, was it purely market factors or were there anything that you might have been able to do that might have ameliorated the impact of the market factor with regard to your performance in export?", "Jim Rubright", "The pulp markets are the price taker, and we've exported it about what we thought we were going to export, 8,000 ton range of pulp from the containerboard sector; we don\u2019t export in consumer.  So no, I thought we do what we could do, but we took price.  And, actually I think we had a pretty positive effect on, particularly, the Latin American market with our execution and our pricing strategy because somebody, we basically, as I say, I think we held the line on pricing and benefited from not matching price in that marketplace.", "George Staphos - Merrill Lynch", "Okay.  I appreciate that.  When we look at the investment thesis that you laid out over the years relative to Smurfit acquisition, a fair amount of it obviously is in generating cash and deleveraging, which you\u2019ve done very well with your prior acquisition.  Certainly, there have been some factors, including the GMI acquisition that have a reason, early in your ownership at Smurfit has prevented the debt pay down perhaps that you might have expected or project initial.  I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a fair comment but I would just like your thoughts there.  And when do you expect -- when should we expect a more meaningful reduction in the debt for the company on a going forward basis?", "Jim Rubright", "Right.  Well, you identified a lot of factors that we have spent a lot of time talking about.  The first one is GML just fell into our lap and the timing was not what we would have liked, but it was, we just couldn\u2019t, not do that transaction. That business has preformed very well.  So there is $90 million that would have otherwise gone to debt reduction.", "The second what we mentioned is the inventory build.  And that inventory build is going to turnaround and that\u2019s $80million, that\u2019s really pretty significant.", "And then lastly, we view the pension funding in excess of expenses a debt repayment.  We always viewed the unfunded pension liability at Smurfit is simply an assumed acquisition liability because the pension plans are largely frozen, and they we\u2019re running relatively low pension expense because of the 85,000 participants, 75,000 are frozen.  So that\u2019s just repaying debt and I think our X what we owe is $69 million was that the amount.  So while we get, we payoff $69 million of acquisition debt there.", "Ultimately, the unfunded pension liabilities remains pretty high, but that\u2019s a function of the fact that right now if you look at the 10-year treasury on an inflation adjusted basis we have negative interest rates.  We\u2019re paying the federal government to owe their money right now.  So do you think -- do we all think that\u2019s really a normalized condition.  It\u2019s going to extend through the five-year period in which we anticipate funding that unfunded liability.  Personally, I just don\u2019t see how that condition can continue as it is and if you have a change in the discount rate that will dramatically affect our funding obligation.  So we still look at it so we've reduced that liability by the funds that we\u2019ve contributed.", "George Staphos - Merrill Lynch", "Okay.  Last one, I\u2019ll turn it over very quickly.  You said the maintenance expense was, the average expense was $6 million I believe in the quarter that just passed.  I think you said $17 million for this quarter, then $19 million for the remaining two quarters of the year.  Did I get that right?  Thanks guys.", "Jim Rubright", "", "It\u2019s 7, not 17 and 19.  It\u2019s on bit of a slide.", "George Staphos - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, I will turn it over.  Thanks.", "Jim Rubright", "And that\u2019s just, that\u2019s the maintenance expense.  It\u2019s not the production loss.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Wilde, Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "I wondered if you guys can put a little bit more color on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of competitive box conditions, box market conditions?  And you can put any kind of color around what might be going on broadly in box pricing?", "Jim Rubright", "We live in a competitive world.  I think on slide 10, we showed our price mix, which is largely price adversely affected us by that $10 million in the quarter, that\u2019s $10 million on segment sales, but it's really box price effects of a pretty competitive market.", "When you have, what we\u2019ve had, Mark, which is a very long period of time of stable containerboard pricing and essentially not much of a recovery in demand, you\u2019re going to get continued pressure on box pricing.  And so, I think what we\u2019ve got is what we\u2019ve got until some major contingency in our business resolved itself or really something changes.  So it\u2019s just a competitive world.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Yeah, I know you wouldn\u2019t know all this in detail, Jim, but does it seem like it kind of goes to cross sort of your whole box mix, and I guess what I\u2019m really getting at is, would you expect that containerboard prices are flat, box prices are going down, that even independent converters of corrugated are probably think some margin compression right now?", "Jim Rubright", "Well, I think they have to be because containerboard pricing is been held as held up.  I mean, we\u2019re not seeing a change in containerboard pricing and demand is fine.  So maybe if you look, if you just take the exports away, our domestic demand has been fine and pricing has been fine.", "So if we\u2019re seeing compression as an integrated, if you don\u2019t have the mills behind you and you\u2019re an independent, you\u2019re definitely seeing compression.  If you\u2019re seeing the same thing in the marketplace as we are, and we\u2019re 50% national accounts and 50% regional and local accounts.  So 50% of our business we\u2019re out there with the independents.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay.  Next moving to this export weakness, I\u2019m just assuming that the market doesn\u2019t bounce and I\u2019m hearing some of the same things that you suggested that maybe its bottom, that maybe there is a little bounce.  But if it really didn\u2019t bounce this year, would you make a capacity just more of a permanent capacity decision rather than just taking downtime?", "Jim Rubright", "Well, we\u2019ll evaluate that as we move through the year, Mark.  We certainly are responding to the demand signals in the marketplace now.  If you drive by the Jacksonville Mill, you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s not operating, and that we\u2019re pretty consistent in our approach to the business.  So we\u2019ll continue to monitor that situation.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "All right, and this is also Jim just you\u2019ve never been a big exporter before other than I think kind of pulp part of Gulf States, but does this, the last quarter too and the drop-off in the export markets.  Does that have you rethinking about sort of the channels through which you go to the export market?", "Jim Rubright", "Well we will rather view that we could improve the overall performance of the business by really disappointing ourselves with respect to the way in which we sold particularly in the Latin America and improve that market.  And as I mentioned before, I think that had a positive effect on this quarter.  But to a certain extent if you have this demand drop 4% to 5% in Europe, as you did in European converter, so they\u2019re not going to rationalize temporary capacity.  They are going to come into the marketplace.  They\u2019re going to have a pretty significant effect on price and that\u2019s what we saw.  So you immediately you, you withhold your capacity and we did some of both.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay.  Last question I had, page 38, in the slide that you\u2019ve gone sort of that cost curve for your mills, and I just wondered if you could take the last three mills at the right St. Paul, Matane, and Jacksonville and you talk about sort of what your strategy is at each of those?", "Jim Rubright", "Yes, right now, we\u2019re really evaluating the overall situation.  We haven\u2019t announced any major changes there. St. Paul is like you see Rock-Tenn mill its cash cost relatively high but it has extremely favorable shipping radius because it supports our Midwest box plants. It\u2019s fine.", "Matane is a little bit more challenged.  We actually have the capacity to pulp virgin fibers in Canada, but virgin fiber in Canada is very expensive.  Of course, makes no sense because all you see is trees around the place.  But Canada can have whatever policies it wants to have.  So Matane is a little bit challenge with respect to its cost structure and there is not a lot we can do from an investment standpoint.", "Jacksonville has very high energy cost due to legacy energy contract that we simply fell into that.  We believe, we can and need to restructure, and then we\u2019ll evaluate the best answer there", "Jacksonville also, we think we can improve the cost of fiber into the mill.  We are making some steps to rationalize fiber supply and of course with our large recycle presence in the Southeast, I\u2019m sure we can do some improvements there.  But they\u2019re not assets that capital will have a significant impact.  They are what they are, all three of them.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay.  Last question.  Is there any roll through from these OCC prices into the current quarter?  In other words, was there any lag in terms of how the inventory rolled through such that we might see further reduction this quarter?", "Jim Rubright", "Well, yes, the inventory lag really should flow through and I think there is something in the range of $10 million to $12 million, if pricing stayed the same, as it was in December?  It\u2019s up a little bit; export pricing is up a little bit in January.  We haven\u2019t seen February yet and really it depends on what happens to pricing going forward.  But there is a $10 million to $12 million roll through just as you indicate.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chip Dillon, Vertical Research Partners.  Your line is open.", "Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners", "First question is little one, is the slide shows $19 million maintenance cost in the fourth fiscal quarter, but there is no downtime indicated for that quarter.  I was wondering how you would reconcile those two?", "Jim Rubright", "We are amortizing the cost of outages.  So when we incur an outage at say earlier in this fiscal year, those costs will be put on the balance sheet and recognized overtime, between the time of the initial outage and the next schedule of outage for the mill that took downtime.  So, the 19, is the accumulation of those cost and that would be expensed during that quarter.", "Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners", "As we look at the next few years, sort of when you get to more steady state post Smurfit-Stone, I would guess that means then maybe a similar pattern as we\u2019re seeing this year with pretty low maintenance expense in the first half of the fiscal year and bigger in the second half when actually you\u2019re running the mills better?", "Steve Voorhees", "Right, Chip, we\u2019re adopting a different accounting methods than Smurfit had.  And just there was effectively no outage expense on the balance sheet at the time of the acquisition.  So the buildup this year is really the accumulation of those cost over time.  So you wouldn\u2019t expect that buildup to occur.  I think going forward, that amount of the $17 million to $19 million would be in the range of what we would expect going forward steady state.", "Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners", "Gotcha, for the quarter, okay.  And then, on the total synergy and cost reduction and just to verify, I think you mentioned you expect to be at $400 million run rate by the end of fiscal \u201813, and ultimately at $550 million.  Sort of how does that last $150 million phase in, will that be seen by the end of \u201814 or does it stretch into \u201815, I know that\u2019s getting out there but just to kind of give as a feel for that?", "James Rubright ", "Those two pieces to the number, and the $150 million is the synergy number that we\u2019re defining as benefits that occurred from a result of the combination that we\u2019re expecting to get to that run rate by the end of this calendar year.  The second number the $400 million is a separate number.  That\u2019s what we\u2019re expecting to get to a very longer period of time the first two and a half years of the acquisition.  Those two numbers aggregate to the $550 million.", "Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners", "Gotcha, okay.  So, by the end of \u201814 roughly is when you think you will see the full amount on both categories?", "", "James Rubright", "I think during fiscal year \u201814, yes.", "", "Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners", "Okay.  Gotcha.  And then -- and the last thing is on the natural gas side.  I know that there maybe incrementally higher amount of gas usage in the fourth calendar or fourth fiscal quarter because of the cooler weather, but I noticed the energy cost could go up slightly even though we had that that one-fourth drop in the strip.  Were there any hedges that were leftover from Smurfit-Stone that might have caused you not to see a bigger drop in energy?  It seems like you\u2019re seeing more this quarter when it\u2019s even -- the weather is even more of an issue?", "Steve Voorhees", "", "Definitely not, thanks for asking that question.  The number, which is on the slide is a, net of a price and volume variants.  The price was positive.  However during the colder months we consume more energy at our northern interior locations.  And so that\u2019s a net of us using higher volume combined with the benefit of lower price.", "Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners", "", "Gotcha.  And then lastly, just as you think about the dividend, I know that there is -- as I go back in time it seems like there, is there a sort of way you think about going forward a policy in terms of-- ", "We've not that of really you would like to visit more likely once a year and/or do you think we\u2019re going to see a more sort of presents  -- on a more ad-hoc basis depending on the conditions at any given point of time?", "Jim Rubright", "We have not thought of really making any change in our dividend policy or the view that we will pay dividend and we want to pay dividend that roughly replicates our market index.  But our belief is that through investments in our business and that return is certainly for the foreseeable future.  We\u2019ll drive the best value for our shareholders.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Weintraub, Buckingham Research.  Your line is open.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "", "First, I just wanted to follow-up a little bit on the $400 million profit improvement program.  I think you noted in the prior question that you hope that that will largely show up by the fiscal \u201814, and how much though would you expect to show up in fiscal \u201813?  Certainly the energy project, the $50 million there presumably would all be in fiscal \u201813, but how about of the other $350 million, how much of it, would half of that potentially be showing up by fiscal \u201813 or is it more backend than that?", "Steve Voorhees", "No, I think you\u2019ll see a pretty significant slug.  I mean, I said we got about $140 million in capital in Hodge and Hopewell and we\u2019ll spend that and have those projects completed by the end of first fiscal quarter of \u201913.  And so, those are basically minimum 40% return projects.  So that\u2019s, let\u2019s do the math, over $50 million just from those two projects alone and the energy projects are $40 million.  So that\u2019s $90 million.", "And then, there is a significant slug that\u2019s going to come out of box plant rationalization and realignment where we\u2019re optimizing the footprint of the box plants, optimizing staffing, basically doing pretty significant equipment realignments in the plants and those are going to really pretty significant benefits, but that\u2019s like sort of like an 18 month timeframe to get through a lot of what we contemplate 18 months from now.", "There is a very significant slug of synergies and performance improvements that will be in place midyear 2013, fiscal 2013, once we get all the systems projects done.  And that\u2019s the part a little frustrating because, you do the JD Edwards conversion, but you really haven\u2019t done enough until you convert the box plants to really optimize the administrative functioning of the corporation.", "So mid-fiscal 2013 you should see a lot, and as I\u2019ve indicated a fair amount of that is going to come out of performance improvements and increased capacity in the containerboard mill system, and so you should be starting to see significant cost reductions through productivity improvements by the middle of 2013 basically off of the 2012, early 2013 capital, maintenance capital expenditures.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "", "Okay.  And you highlighted kind of legacy performance issues.  I was trying to understand was -- were there any surprises, I mean were they the quality and/or productivity issues a little bit more pronounced in the last quarter than you were hoping to be at and what type of impact, if any, is the fact that you do have these very active capital projects underway potentially having on productivity, while the projects are underway?", "Jim Rubright", "", "Well, first, with respect to our expectations at the time we did the acquisition relative to what we found in the mill system, I think it was pretty consistent with what we had expected and I\u2019ve said there is probably $150 million in 2012 and 2013 that really is to address capital maintenance issues that will have effects on the productivity and product quality, which again is very important to rationalizing the functioning of the system.  So I would say our expectations there were consistent.", "I am disappointed that we haven\u2019t been able to ramp up the production as fast as I thought possible and there are a couple of factors that work there.  Number one is as we\u2019ve discussed we essentially replaced under Mike Exner\u2019s leadership the entire leadership of the containerboard mill system and they\u2019re in the process of also realigning their staffing to essentially put in place the people that can make the kind of sort of significant productivity and quality improvements in our mill system that we think are possible there.  So you have to put all of that in place before you can really start and so while we\u2019re seeing improvements, we\u2019re not seeing at the pace that I think all of us would be happy to have seen.", "And then, a lot of it just takes capital and you got to ultimately determine exactly where the greatest and priority projects are, and then you got to engineer them and employ them and a lot of it has to be done in outages.  So, I would expect a lot of the stuff, if we pick a mill that\u2019s going to have a third quarter 2012 outage.  You are just waiting until then to fix a problem that needs to be fixed, there is nothing you can do about it.  So, I think that\u2019s a frustration.  Now, whether it\u2019s a difference between what we expected or not I don\u2019t know, I just know I have a lot more granular knowledge of it that I would have without spending six months working with the system.", "Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research", "And just one clarification on what you\u2019re just saying.  You talked about not ramping up production as fast as you were hoping, was it that or more quality because presumably -- I mean you chose to take some economic downtime given what\u2019s going on in the export market.  And so, it didn\u2019t seem like you needed to produce more products?", "Jim Rubright", "Well, just stop.  We\u2019ve got a cost curve and we\u2019ve got low cost mills and got high cost mills.  If I can increase the production at a low cost mill, I can reduce the production at a high cost mill.  Lot of those high cost mills are recycled where the cost of outages is zero.  You can turnoff a recycle containerboard machine and then turn it back on.  So, the fact is that if we had been able to ramp-up sooner productivity increases in our lowest cost assets further reducing their costs, we would have been able to produce the overall production cost in the mill, and in fact that\u2019s large part of what we see going forward.  So I think that that\u2019s issue.", "With respect to productivity the capital is really going to do two things.  It\u2019s the one, I\u2019ve just discussed, which is incur increased productivity in very well cost assets.  But secondly, there are a lot of inefficiencies in the way this system operates because of inconsistent quality in production and the mill system.  So those are kinds of things I said we got to address, in some cases through capital and that capital deployment will occur over the balance of this year.  And a good bit of it because of the way we schedule the capital out into 2013.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Philip Ng, Jefferies.  Your line is open.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies", "So, I want to get your thought on just the rationale, I mean behavior of some of your competitors, it sounds like you guys took a pretty disciplined approach in managing capacity on the export side.  And then your big competitors act accordingly as well?", "Jim Rubright", "I am really not going to comment beyond what I said with respect to that.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies", "Okay, that\u2019s fine.  And then, just help me understand the table that you have on page 10, you guys breakout the pricing, it sounds like the drag on seasonal mix should reverse itself in Q2.  Are you seeing any further deterioration in the box price side?", "Jim Rubright", "The seasonal mix, as I -- I think I mentioned -- I will try to make this clear we will reverse over the course of Q2.  So the full benefit of it you will see in Q3.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies", "Okay.", "Jim Rubright", "", "Not in Q2.  And then, I\u2019m sorry, can you ask me the second part of your question again please.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies", "What about box prices, have you seen price to deteriorate further from what you saw in the previous quarter?", "Jim Rubright", "No.  I would just continue to say its relatively competitive marketplace out there right now, and that\u2019s just what we see.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful.  And this is the last question, just the maintenance expense part I mean I think that you said the steady-state number is going to be $17 million to $19 million on a per quarter basis, is that incremental or is that just a run rate going forward?", "Steve Voorhees", "That\u2019s the run rate.  So, in other words, we will ramp up to that run rate as we do a full year of maintenance outages, and then that full year of maintenance outages on a mill-by-mill basis has been amortized over the course of the 12 months till the next outage.  So, once you get to your full run rate then that is essentially steady-state run rate.  And, whether its $17 million, $19 million, or $15 million, I don\u2019t know because we know we got relatively major maintenance outages this year compared to historical practices, and I think there is possibility that ramps downs slightly to something could be in the $15 million to $17 million range, but it\u2019s sense if you use $17 million quarter for 2013, that would be about as good as an estimate as we can make.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Al Kabili, Credit Suisse.  Your line is open.", "Al Kabili - Credit Suisse", "Yeah, thanks.  Just a quick question on the inventory build, and I think you\u2019re building a little bit more inventory in this past quarter and going forward, does that suggest that you may have to take a little bit more downtime in this quarter, economic downtime, as conditions stay the same?  Help me out with that one please thank you.", "Jim Rubright", "Well, we\u2019re building through this quarter and we expect we are building more than we said we would, but that has nothing to do with market demand, domestic, or export its really a function of our view with respect to what the system requirements will be based on the sales we\u2019ve achieved in our box plant system for Q3 -- Q2 and Q3 in connection with the audit, Q3 and Q4.  But it\u2019s also a view with respect to the ending balance we want to have when we come out of the busy season, which is the September quarter.  So that\u2019s its just unrelated to the market.  Its really the export market not the domestic market that\u2019s really the determinant of how much downtime we end up taking, and frankly that\u2019s not something we can predict with great certainty at this point because we are in a market that seems to be changing.", "Al Kabili - Credit Suisse", "Okay.  On the legacy Rock-Tenn business, it seemed like the last time OCC prices fell and demand is sluggish, that the business held up a little better than what we're seeing right now.  I was wondering, Jim, if you can you just give us a little bit of perspective on that, if anything has changed in that regard in terms of dynamics maybe with the Smurfit assets that you've added?", "Jim Rubright", "Well, yeah, I think you are referring to the 2008, 2009 recession and the business performed marvelously then because you had just a precipitous fall in recycled fiber pricing that ultimately bottomed at $40 a ton whereas the margin -- the market bottomed at a higher level.  Also the New England and Buffalo indexes did not decline as much as Chicago and the southeast.  So, the relative benefit in the northeast where the Solvay Mill which is 800,000 tons of capacity resides did not benefit as much.  We are going to pull the number right now but Matt, what did you have for the difference.  The northeast was down $25 whereas the southeast and southwest were down $45.  so, you just didn\u2019t have a proportionate benefit with respect to the northeastern recycle capacity we have.", "Al Kabili - Credit Suisse", "Last question, Jim, what are you seeing right now in the box board markets?  I guess any thoughts on SBS prices falling, CRB holding steady with despite OCC falling any risks there, one.  And then you mentioned, you talked backlogs were going to start to build again, and are you seeing anything there gets you more optimistic or is that is just the seasonality impact there?'", "Jim Rubright", "I'm glad you asked.  I think in the general holding market, CRB, coated recycled board is fine, and then we are seeing backlogs build there.  and so, with the exception of the specialty mill I mentioned I think that\u2019s fine and I don\u2019t see any reason why based on operating rates you'd see any change in pricing.", "SBS, I was disappointed.  We were a large seller to independents and we had not seen price deterioration in the prices we were selling and the balance is ultimately integrated with customer contract.  So, our pricing was stable but I think because of the operating rates and the down time that people had announced, not us, but others in the industry, that probably influenced the index better.  So, when you change the index by $20 a ton I mean, ultimately that\u2019s going to show up in our spot sales and then ultimately over time pass through into our contracts if it isn\u2019t reversed.", "On the other hand, we're seeing a seasonal rebuilding of demand for SBS.  So, actually our backlogs are strengthening, and I think the most recent operating rates I saw also indicated some return of operating rates in the system but we do have one major player who's got announcing pretty significant down time, but again, I don\u2019t know the end-markets that are weak.  Our demand for folding SBS is fine.", "Al Kabili - Credit Suisse", "", "And then just follow -- last question for Steve, tax rate.  37% to 38% I think you guided to is a little bit higher than order have been trending.  Is that -- can you just help with the -- is that the full year tax rate we should be thinking about?  What are some of the drivers there?", "Steve Voorhees", "It is a full year tax rate and there is a number of factors that caused I think the inquiries from the guidance we gave last quarter, but it is the full year books tax rate.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steve Chercover, D.A. Davidson.  Your line is open.", "Steve Chercover - D.A. Davidson", "First of all, could you help us, I think your down time and I can see on the board was 80,000 tons as opposed to the 40,000-odd that you\u2019ve guided.  How much of it was economic and how much of it was the West Point Mill, the delta between the original guidance?", "Steve Voorhees", "Well, let me just pull it out and give it to you.  So, of the 81,000 tons we had West Point was 11,000.  We had maintenance down time of about 45,000 and the rest was economic.", "Steve Chercover - D.A. Davidson", "Thanks for that clarification.  Now, I'm no IT specialist but obviously the Smurfit system fro SAP to JD Edwards is much bigger than converting your system to theirs.  So, is there something wrong with SAP or is just two limited in terms of the flexibility?", "Steve Voorhees", "SAP is a very good system.  It's very expensive to operate, maintain and staff and it provides a degree of complexity that really isn\u2019t necessary to operate our business.  Our JD Edwards implementation is very efficient, provides the information we want.  We've integrated it much more deeply into organization with respect to enterprise asset management integration with the financial systems or the operating assets much more deeply than Smurfit have been able to do with respect to SAP installation.", "And the other reason is cost.  I mean, we expect to take out $25 million in total IT cost on a run rate basis, essentially none of that that we've experience today.  so, it\u2019s a very detailed cost benefit analysis that drives us to promulgate the Rock-Tenn systems.", "Steve Chercover - D.A. Davidson", "Final quick question.  with the stock down at 8.5%, do you contemplate maybe managing expectations any differently going forward?", "Steve Voorhees", "We try to do the best we can to give people in some visibility into the components of our revenue and expense and to comment as candidly as we can with respect to business conditions and people then can model our business, as they choose to do so.  We have not believed it to be our interest to try to get specific earnings per share guidance.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bill Hoffman, RBC Capital Markets.  Your line is open.", "Bill Hoffman - RBC Capital Markets", "", "Just have two quick questions.  Folks, you went through the energy projects, and I just want to if you can explain a little bit more about the Solvay project, how that actually works from a cash standpoint?", "Jim Rubright", "", "Our agreement, we are not able to get into the details, but I think our plan would be to follow for a format to use natural gas at the Solvay location and then that would in turn cause the contract to be terminated, and then we would put natural gas boilers in places rapidly as possible.  And I think the overall comment that the cash would over time finance a good portion of the natural gas package boilers about all I can say.", "Bill Hoffman - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay.  Then, I'm assuming there is some contract format with that coal system.", "", "Jim Rubright", "", "Exactly.", "Bill Hoffman - RBC Capital Markets", "", "Okay.  Thanks.  And then, the other question is just with regards to pension liability, have you had to recalibrate the total pension liability at this point and time that you gave guidance proofs for the payments for this year, with the total liability is.", "Jim Rubright", "I think it\u2019s not significantly changed from what we would have recorded in September.", "Bill Hoffman - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay.  And, that was about $1.4 billion I think.", "Jim Rubright", "", "Right.", "Bill Hoffman - RBC Capital Markets", "Now, do you have to recalibrate it here as you get in the 2012?", "Jim Rubright", "No, not for a financial statement purposes, we do look at it because we manage the overall assets and liabilities actively.  But, from a financial recording standpoint we just value it once a year.", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions).", "At this time, there are no further questions.  I will turn the call back to you for closing remarks.", "Jim Rubright", "", "Thank you for your participation on the call.", "Operator", "This does conclude today\u2019s conference.

Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the MWV Fourth Quarter and Year-End Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Starting off today, we have Director, Investor Relations, Jason Thompson. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jason Thompson", "Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced our results before the market opened. The notification of this morning's call was broadly disclosed. And further, this morning's call is being webcast at mwv.com, and slides that accompany this call are available there as well. ", "I'll briefly remind you that certain statements we make are forward-looking and are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties described in our public filings. Furthermore, contents contain time-sensitive information that, although correct today, may change with the passage of time.", "All the results we share this morning are presented on a continuing operations basis. For the fourth quarter, the company's loss from continuing operations was $9 million. Excluding special items, adjusted net income from continuing operations was $44 million or $0.26 per share. ", "Now here to tell you more about the results for the fourth quarter are John Luke, Chairman and CEO; Jim Buzzard, our President; and Mark Rajkowski, CFO. ", "I'll now turn the call over to John.", "John A. Luke", "Jason, thanks very much and good morning. MWV delivered another strong performance in 2011 even with the weaker fourth quarter due to the economic challenges primarily in North America and Europe. We had record adjusted income from continuing operations in 2011 of $335 million or $1.92 per share as we benefited from our market focus strategies and improved business model. ", "We strengthened our growth profile, implementing plans in each of our global markets to win new business with our most strategic customers, with our most innovative solutions and in the world's fastest-growing geographies. And we generated significant cash flow that we used to make growth investments and provide a strong return to our shareholders. ", "I'd also mention that we announced the spinoff of our Consumer & Office Products division, which will also create significant value for our shareholders when the transaction is closed in the first half of this year. These financial results during the past year came directly from the plans we're pursuing for profitable growth and value creation. ", "Across our packaging markets, we are focused on commercial excellence, innovation, growth in emerging markets and expanded participation with new materials and capabilities. As we discussed at our December Investor Meeting, we aim to generate $1 billion in profitable revenue from this plan over the next 3 to 5 years. ", "In Specialty Chemicals, we are aligning our capabilities and value proposition with global mega trends including emissions reductions, infrastructure investment and energy exploration. We'll look to extend the record earnings we generated in this business in 2011. ", "In Land Management, we're implementing a strategy to generate additional value from our landholdings by improving and selling small rural tracts and making infrastructure improvements on select properties to enhance development potential, especially in the Charleston, South Carolina region. We made great progress putting these strategies into action throughout the year, including during the fourth quarter. You'll hear more detail from Jim and Mark in just a moment, but the following are just a few highlights that demonstrate our momentum. ", "We won new beverage packaging business from Dr. Pepper Snapple during the fourth quarter after demonstrating a new set of innovation capabilities that will help enhance their brands in the marketplace. ", "In the food market, similar commercial excellence efforts led to share gains for our MWare paperboard for coffee cups in 2 of the largest quick serve and convenience store chains in the country. We had market share gains in beverage multipack and skin care dispensers in Asia, which helped pace 10% growth in emerging markets during 2011. ", "Lastly, at the end of the fourth quarter, we acquired Polytop, a highly respected and innovative maker of caps and closures, that will significantly extend our presence in the food, beauty and personal care, and home and garden markets. This is an example of expanded participation into the most technologically advanced closure systems in the packaging industry, and we expect the addition of Polytop to have a modest positive contribution to our earnings this year. ", "Despite these highlights and others, the fourth quarter was weaker than we had anticipated due to the economic factors we've already cited. Against that backdrop, we continued to implement our strategies, generating profitable growth that not only contributed meaningfully to our results, but also strengthened our market position compared to the competition. But like the competition, we were not immune to the impact of macroeconomic developments. Despite the present softness mostly attributable to the crisis in Europe and economic challenges in North America, the packaging markets that we have targeted still have very attractive long-term growth rates. ", "We remain very confident in our market-based strategies and focused on the priorities that will make us successful over the longer term. They include growing our business through the 4 elements of commercial excellence, innovation, focus on emerging markets and expanded participation; improving our business model and productivity to increase profitability; and driving cash flow to invest in our business and return value to shareholders. Our execution in these areas will help ensure that we deliver performance that meets or exceeds the targets we've laid out for the next several years. ", "I'll now turn to Jim for a report on our operational and segment performance.", "James A. Buzzard", "Thank you, John. In a tough demand environment like that one we faced during the fourth quarter, we did well to execute on the things we can control to preserve or strengthen our market position and improve the productivity of our operations. We executed on the commercial side with strong pricing and product mix gains that more than offset input cost inflation in each of our businesses, as well as some market share gains that I will describe in just a moment. ", "We also increased the productivity of our manufacturing facilities through our operating excellence initiative. Much of our improvement, however, was offset by the planned outage at our Covington paperboard mill for both maintenance and upgrades, as well as unabsorbed fixed cost across our manufacturing system, as we lowered output to meet reduced demand. ", "I'll now provide some details about the performance in each of our segments. Additional information is available in our press release and the slides that accompany this call. ", "In the Packaging Resources segment, sales were up during the fourth quarter as we continued to drive strong pricing and product mix improvement and earned share gains in our highest value markets. We had a very good performance in global markets for food and beverage packaging with our Coated Natural Kraft product lines. In particular, new wins with some of our global food brand owners helped increase volume in these markets during the fourth quarter. However, overall paperboard shipments were down due to the impact of weaker demand in some of our more economically sensitive markets for bleached paperboard including commercial print, general packaging and office products. ", "We also had lower shipments for tobacco packaging due to the outage at Covington and lower volume of corrugated packaging in Brazil due to the continued slowdown in economic growth. GDP growth is expected to be in the range of 3% to 4% in Brazil this year, and we expect to grow not only through ongoing economic improvement but also through the implementation of our aggressive plans supported by the new box plant in Aracatuba and the paper machine investment in Tres Barras that will contribute meaningfully in 2013. ", "Fourth quarter earnings in Packaging Resources were well below last year's level, but the segment earned $322 million in 2011, which is a 25% increase over the record level set in 2010. Lower earnings in the fourth quarter this year were due to the balancing of production to meet demand, as well as the impact of the major Covington outage. ", "In the Consumer Solutions segment, sales in the fourth quarter were the same as last year, with pricing and product mix improvements in most of our markets, as well as additional revenue from the Spray Plast acquisition, getting largely offset by weaker demand for personal care packaging in Europe and home and garden packaging in North America, as well as the effects of the weaker euro. ", "As John mentioned a moment ago, we won some new business in beverage with Dr. Pepper Snapple in North America based on our brand engagement works and high quality solutions, and we also continue to win business converting multipacks of large glass bottles from corrugated to our paperboard solutions. In addition to gaining share in developed soft drink and beer markets, we're also growing aggressively in emerging markets, especially China where cans are becoming the preferred format and where suppliers and customers are making large investments in canned production and fulfillment. This trend favors our multipack solutions and is part of the reason our machine replacement are up strongly around the world, including China and other emerging markets. ", "More than half of our beauty and personal care business is in Europe where the economic crisis had an impact on consumer demand and resulted in more aggressive inventory management by customers, particularly in November and December. We have grown our market share position in fragrance and continued to win market share in the skin category in Asia. Some of our customers are talking about new project launches and the potential for growth in 2012, and we are positioned to win more than our share of this business through commercial excellence initiatives and a strong pipeline of innovative products. ", "In home and garden, we continue to be impacted as key customers balance their supply chains following the weeklong garden season last year. We've replaced some of this volume by expanding our Spray Plast trigger business in Eastern Europe and parts of the Middle East and Asia. This kind of opportunity to leverage Spray Plast's capabilities across our global platform is an important basis for growing this business. We'll continue with this effort and will do the same as we integrate Polytop\u2019s caps and closures into our existing global platform, not only for home and garden, but also for food and personal care markets. ", "Lastly in healthcare, Shellpak sales peaked for the year during the fourth quarter as our biggest retail customers extended their commitment to adherence packaging for their prescription drug programs. The market for adherence packaging and healthcare continues to develop around the world. The U.S. Surgeon General highlighted the need for better medication adherence in a recent campaign, and the use of packaging to deliver improved adherence remains the most cost-effective solution. ", "Overall, earnings in the Consumer Solutions segment were lower than the prior year. We continue to recoup pricing to offset the impact of resin cost inflation, but our earnings were negatively impacted by lower unit volume in some markets and rising input costs -- rising costs for other inputs. ", "In the Consumer & Office Products segment, we had a strong performance this year punctuated by the announcement that we will spinoff this business and merge it with ACCO Brands. The transaction is expected to generate significant value for MWV shareholders and will create a leader in the school and office products market. We are on track to close this deal in the first half of 2012.", "In the fourth quarter, sales of dated and time management products were better than expected and improved compared to last year, while volumes were down slightly and improved mix of higher value products contributed to the sales increase. ", "Our Brazilian business had a strong year, with growth in both sales and earnings despite lower volumes in the fourth quarter due to weaker sales at retail and fewer replenishment orders. We expect the remainder of the back-to-school season in Brazil, which continues into the first quarter, to be challenged by this slower economic conditions. ", "In the Specialty Chemicals segment, we had an outstanding year with strong performance in the auto carbon, asphalt paving, oilfield and adhesives markets. Across the board, we have shifted our product mix significantly toward more innovative and value-added formulations for these markets, leading to the earnings profile we've seen over the past several quarters. Though the comparisons will certainly be more difficult in this business going forward, we can expect continued performance in line with the earnings model we've laid out. ", "In the fourth quarter, higher sales of auto carbon were driven by the steady increase in production of hybrids and the return to full production in Japan following the disruptions earlier this year. Our honeycomb carbon technologies were up more than 50% in the period, and we expect these innovative solutions to continue to grow as the market moves towards more fuel-efficient, low-emission vehicles. ", "Our asphalt paving business had its best year on record in the United States. As many localities shift to spending available transportation dollars on maintenance projects, our new products for this segment are performing well. In addition, Evotherm sales were higher around the world. However, the asphalt paving market continues to be affected by lower spending on infrastructure in China. ", "Finally, our sales in the oilfield market are still very strong as we're gaining market share and expanding margins by responding to specific customer needs with exact formulations designed to maximize the performance of their drilling operations. ", "In Community Development and Land Management, the pace of rural land sales continued to meet our expectations in the fourth quarter with 21 transactions closing for gross proceeds of $11 million. Overall, we are very pleased with the price per acre given the difficult conditions that persist in the real estate market. Our average price per acre in 2011 was more than $2,400, which demonstrates our ability to continue to deliver value to shareholders from this strategic and selective approach. ", "We've also had a number of positive signs in the development side of the business, where we are focused on taking advantage of the opportunities in South Carolina. That includes the significant economic activity being generated from the Boeing plant, which is set to produce the first streamliner in the first half of this year, as well as the proposed deepening of the Charleston port and the success of high-technology military suppliers to this major project. These trends, along with a very low availability of suitable existing buildings across the region, have led to a number of new opportunities for our Development business. ", "At our Parks of Berkeley development site in the Charleston suburb of Summerville, we completed the Phase 1 entitlements and permitting and expect to start construction very soon on the infrastructure that will support hotels, office space, local retailers and apartments, all consistent with the absorption rate we expect for the land in this area. We are working on a number of initiatives for this phase of the project. ", "And lastly, as a follow-up to the information we shared during our investor event in Charleston last year, we continue to monitor closely the potential for natural gas extraction on our land in the Marcellus Shale area of West Virginia. We have leased the land to Bluescape, and they have begun a number of test wells to determine the extent of the reserves. Initial results are very positive, and Bluescape has announced a $100 million investment in the new pipeline to service the wells on our land, as well as other sites in the area. We will continue to share updates on the evaluation and development of these potentially valuable resources. ", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss some of our financial metrics for the fourth quarter. Mark?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Thanks, Jim. Despite the softening in demand we saw during the fourth quarter, we delivered another year of record operating results through the powerful combination of our profitable growth strategies and stronger business model. Some financial highlights from the year include a 20% improvement in adjusted EBIT, which at $635 million is a new annual record for the company; 10.5% EBIT margins, a 120 basis point improvement compared to last year; strong cash flow from operations of approximately $560 million; and of course, the significant value creating transaction with our Consumer & Office Products business that has a current total value to MWV shareholders of more than $1 billion. ", "We achieved these strong results against the backdrop of another difficult year for the global economy. Our continued progress clearly demonstrates that we have established a solid foundation, and that we can continue to build on this foundation to reach the revenue and earnings targets that we've set for the next 3 to 5 years. However, as we saw in the fourth quarter, our revenue and earnings growth will not be linear. And we expect the global demand environment to remain challenging in 2012, particularly across North America and Europe. That's why we are intensely focused on the execution of our profitable growth initiatives. ", "John and Jim touched on just a few examples of where we've won new business, introduced new products and continued to leverage our leading positions in emerging markets. So despite the challenging market environment, there are compelling signs that we can strengthen our competitive position and outperform in terms of total returns for our shareholders over the years ahead. ", "I'll now review our fourth quarter performance, detail our 2012 capital plans and then provide an outlook for the first quarter. During the quarter, we experienced weaker demand for packaging in North America and Europe, primarily in some of our more economically sensitive markets for bleach board, as well as in personal care in the home and garden markets. We discussed these demand trends on our call last quarter, but the decline worsened in November and December as customers reduced orders to lower their inventories heading into 2012. These developments, as well as a weaker euro and real negatively impacted our revenue for the fourth quarter, which was essentially unchanged compared to the prior year. ", "We continued to drive gains in price and mix, reflecting our commercial excellence efforts to price for value and to drive higher margin business with our customers. And we gained some market share by working with major brand owners in several targeted packaging markets including beverage, food and personal care. Our share gains included adding new customers such as Dr Pepper Snapple and extending our positions by growing sales of new products to existing customers. ", "Overall sales in emerging markets declined modestly in the fourth quarter, but our emerging markets growth was still 10% for the year, representing 28% of total company sales. China growth remained strong in the quarter, but our Brazilian businesses felt the impact of lower consumer spending and tighter inventory management by some of our customers, as well as weakness in demand for agricultural exports. Despite a slow fourth quarter in Brazil, the long-term growth trends remained very positive given its demographics and growing consumer class. ", "Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was $93 million versus $140 million last year. The biggest driver in the quarter was our reduced operating leverage due to lower production volumes. These unabsorbed fixed costs  were the primary reason for our 270 basis point reduction in adjusted gross margin, as well as the comparison to last year's fourth quarter that included a large high margin land sale. As we saw weakening demand trends developing through the quarter, we took aggressive actions to manage our supply chain and further reduce our inventory levels heading into this year. ", "Adjusted SG&A in the quarter increased year-over-year due to some modest inflation and investments in new product development and commercial capabilities. We generated about $560 million of cash flow from operations and about $60 million of free cash flow during 2011, excluding the capital investments for our expansion in Brazil and the new Covington boiler. ", "Total CapEx for the year was $670 million, including $208 million for the Brazil expansion and $50 million for the Covington boiler. In 2012, we expect CapEx to be relatively flat with 2011 spend and then return to more normal levels as we complete these 2 major projects. We ended the year with $565 million of cash on hand. The decrease in cash from the previous year is driven by the funding of our growth investments for Rigesa, Covington and the Polytop acquisition in 2011. Our financial position and liquidity remain strong with our total debt to capital at 40% and net debt to capital at 32%. ", "Now turning to the outlook for the first quarter. As I mentioned at the outset, we expect demand to remain weak in several of our markets, at least through the first half of the year due to ongoing global macroeconomic developments, with the greatest risk and uncertainty in Europe. We also expect continued upward pressure on input costs and a negative impact from the stronger dollar. As a result, we expect earnings to decline in the first quarter compared to our very strong results last year. ", "That said, we remain confident that our continued execution of our profitable growth strategy and ongoing improvements to our business model will provide us with a competitive advantage during the current difficult demand environment, as well as enable us to achieve our stated revenue growth and earnings goals over the next 3 to 5 years. ", "Now turning to the business segments. As you know, we will begin reporting our Packaging business under a new segment structure in the first quarter. However, for ease of comparison, we will provide an outlook for our Packaging business in the first quarter under the current format. ", "Starting with the Packaging Resources segment. We expect segment earnings to be below last year, principally driven by continued weak demand in certain end markets, unfavorable euro and real translations, higher planned expenses related to our Rigesa expansion and a planned outage at our Mahrt Coated Natural Kraft mill. While we are seeing continued strong demand in CNK for food beverage markets and reasonable demand in SBS for tobacco and liquid packaging grades, we are continuing to see weaker demand in our more economically sensitive product lines, including commercial print and office products. We expect SBS volume to be down low to mid-single digits and expect to take some downtime to tightly manage inventories. ", "We are executing well on our commercial excellence initiatives and do expect to benefit from improved product pricing and mix, as well as continued strong manufacturing productivity. These benefits will be partially offset by cost increases for raw materials and freight. ", "In Consumer Solutions, we expect segment earnings to be below last year. While we will benefit from improved pricing and mix, as well as productivity, demand will remain weak across key packaging markets in developed geographies including beverage, home and garden, and beauty and personal care. ", "In Specialty Chemicals, we expect modest segment earnings growth above the very strong performance we saw in 2011. Continued growth in higher value markets will be the principal driver of earnings in this segment, with some of these benefits offset by input cost inflation for raw materials. ", "In Consumer & Office Products, profit in the first quarter, a seasonally slower one for this business, will be down modestly from a year ago as we expect weaker retail sales in Brazil to impact the remainder of their back-to-school season. Regarding the spin merge transaction, ACCO recently received financing and we remain confident that it will close in the first half of this year. We will report C&OP as a discontinued operation when the transaction closes. ", "In our Land business, we expect the level of land sales to soften in the first quarter before improving in the second quarter. You may recall that last year, we benefited from the sale of our port servicing warehouse, as well as a large rural tract sale in South Carolina that together generated $27 million in segment earnings during the first quarter. ", "So with that, John, I'll turn it back to you.", "John A. Luke", "Mark, thanks very much. To summarize, we had a very good year in 2011, and we will build on the strong foundation we've laid as we implement our profitable growth plans for the next several years. We're already making progress by winning new business through commercial excellence efforts; developing and commercializing new products and innovative solutions; growing in emerging markets such as China, Brazil and India; expanding our participation with new capabilities and technologies; and improving the productivity of our operations through an ongoing operational excellence initiative. ", "Despite the continued weakness in the global economy due principally to ongoing developments in Europe, our continued execution in each of these areas reflects our commitment to achieving our long-term growth and earnings targets. ", "With this, we'll conclude our prepared remarks, and we'd now be happy to turn to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] First question is from the line of Phil Gresh, JPMorgan.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just a couple of questions on the guidance. On Packaging Resources, you talked about the Mahrt  outage, some potential volume downtimes. Any way you could quantify roughly how much do you expect that to be on a net basis?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, the Mahrt outage is going to cost us around $10 million. Downtime, it's really going to be a function of where those SBS volumes shake out. And right now, as I mentioned, we expect them to be down somewhere between low to mid-single digits. So I don't have a firm number on that, Phil.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then just on the volume side, obviously, the fourth quarter volumes were down roughly 10%-ish year-over-year. Now it's -- your outlook in the first quarter is down low to mid-single. Would you characterize kind of the difference between those 2 as the inventory adjustment that happened? And is this kind of the run rate you're actually seeing right now in January, kind of that low to mid-single or just kind of what are you seeing out there?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Phil, I'll start off and then Jim can chime in. But I do think that, certainly, our customers managing their supply chains and getting their inventories down exacerbated what we saw as weaker demand in the fourth quarter. We believe a lot of that, or most of that, is behind us and that certainly is part of what's driving that change in trajectory, if you will.", "James A. Buzzard", "I think the only thing that I would to add to that is, Phil, now there's point -- there's a series of data points but they're only date points, and there's not a lot of transparency with -- through our customers to their business. So I think we'll obviously be on top of it as the quarter unfolds, and we'll make sure that we're matching our output to our demand.", "John A. Luke", "I think that's right. Phil, it's John. I would just add to what Mark and Jim have said by saying that recognizing, as Jim reinforced, these are single-point data points based upon January's look at the marketplace to date against a cautious economic backdrop. But we're seeing modest upticks in most of the businesses at this stage. And by modest, again, I would go back to your single-digit range but at least coming back from Q4. And that's one not unsurprising, but it certainly is a positive data point.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then just the last question. One of your peers this morning was talking about price declines in SBS. Obviously, it was reported by Reese [ph]. But maybe could you talk about your mix there because it sounds like you're still thinking of positive price mix for this business? So maybe just talk about what you're seeing and how you expect that to play out?", "John A. Luke", "Phil, it's John. I think that's a perfect question and it lets us, as Jim will address, point to our strategy and our approach toward managing the SBS business.", "James A. Buzzard", "Yes, Phil, obviously, we are aware of some reports to some lower prices around the margin. And it's not inconsistent with both the seasonality in the business, as well as some of the economically sensitive areas. But candidly, in the markets that we're playing in and the kind of products we sell, our broad pricing structure remains in place. And we have, I think, pushed to make sure we would cover inflation through price mix. We will continue to do that. And as I said, if there's any fall off in demand, we will continue to match our production to our demand signals.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Gee Panjabi, Robert W. Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "On volume trends in Brazil, I'm sorry if I missed this, but did you quantify what volumes for Rigesa did and also office products in Brazil during the quarter?", "James A. Buzzard", "I would say, on the Rigesa side, the corrugated box business for the quarter was down very slightly but down a little bit. And on the back-to-school side, we're still waiting to see our the way through the end of the back-to-school season. So we were down certainly year-on-year there.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. All right. And just moving onto the paperboard side. You mentioned share gains in CNK. Obviously, the beverage category is still weak overall. Was there any share loss in SBS that was noteworthy? And the 10% volume decline during the quarter that you referenced, how did that progress during the quarter?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes. Ghansham, in terms of SBS, there -- we believe there was some minor share loss in some of the general packaging markets but certainly, nothing in the key end markets that we're focused on.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Mark Connelly, CLSA.", "Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Two things. First, a question about the cap and closure part of the business. Is the mix effect that you're seeing in Europe worse than what you saw in 2008? I guess I'm wondering if there's any offsets or anything like Purell effect like we saw back then? Just trying to get a sense of whether this is looking like the 2008 thing or if it's substantively different. And then second, when you think about paperboard and converting businesses, is this quarter making you think any differently about the actual economic sensitivity of your business or is it really just because it's happened so fast to the businesses that are the most sensitive?", "James A. Buzzard", "Mark, this is Jim. I think going back to your question on the dispensing business. In Europe, I think it is different. We're seeing -- as you look at the end markets in home and garden, for example, we're actually doing quite well in Europe. The Spray Plast was a very nice acquisition for us with great technology that we're growing well with, and we're taking some share in that arena. In the personal and beauty care, it's a mix. So those places, the high-end, the prestige, fragrance and those sorts of things, those are down dramatically and not unexpectedly given the economy. In some of the more masstige end markets, we're doing quite well. So it really is more around economic sensitivity than anything else in the caps and closure business in Europe from our perspective.", "John A. Luke", "And we'll -- Mark, we will provide more information as we move through the quarter and we'll have a broader perspective. I think that's a great question. With respect to the second question, let me just offer the following thoughts and ask Mark and Jim to chime in. I think the short answer is no. I mean, we are very comfortable with the trajectory that we have been on, the plans that we have with paperboard, with converting. And our focus, as you've known over time, has been to continue to inquire about distinctive, profitable, attractive growth opportunities and that's what we're doing. And it's at times like these where there's a little bit of a shock in the marketplace. And you're seeing a bit more of a sudden reaction to that across the board in a range of industries the more we understand that it reinforces to us the merits of our strategy and the continued importance of redoubling our efforts to ever more insulate and differentiate our market possessions.", "Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. Just one more question. Mark, you usually talk about offsetting input cost inflation with productivity over the medium term. How about over the short term? Over the next couple of quarters, do you have enough high impact projects to feel comfortable about that? I mean obviously, your focus lately has been more on innovation than anything else.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, Mark. When we think about input cost inflation, what we're really looking to do there is make sure that we can price for value and recover it in the marketplace in that fashion. We want to make sure that we continue to be as lean as and as efficient as possible. We have a great program that, under Jim's leadership, we rolled out across the company. And we have consistently targeted and has been pretty consistent in delivering 3% to 4% productivity this year, slightly higher than that. And we do expect to deliver 4% operating productivity again in 2012. So that has been and will remain an important focus for us.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Mark Wilde, Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Mark, I wonder -- Mark Rajkowski, I wonder if we could start off by an update on the pension situation and what you might be looking at in terms of potentially pension income in 2012 versus '11?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Sure. As I'm sure you're all aware, the interest rate in environment has moved relatively dramatically, and the discount rates for most companies are going to be coming down substantially. And we're in that same boat, so we do expect a 100 basis point drop in the discount rate, which will do a couple of things: one, as you know, increase the size of the liability but also increase interest expense, which will reduce pension income. So pension income, we're forecasting to be down $20 million next year. And as you know, that's a non-cash item. And the plan, despite these changes in discount rate assumptions, is still significantly overfunded, and we have no future call on cash. So while it will impact the accounting in pension income next year, we're still very sound in terms of an overfunded position.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Excellent. All right. The second question, in Consumer Solutions, is it possible to give us just some sense of what Spray Plast did for kind of sales and operating income in the fourth quarter so that we might be able to see what the underlying business did x Spray Plast?", "John A. Luke", "We're not providing that break out. I think as we move, Mark, into the new segment reports, we can look to provide a bit more descriptive color on that business to try to get at some of the questions that you got.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, it's pretty well-integrated into our home and garden business at this point. The income -- the EBIT effect was modestly accretive to the segment in the fourth quarter.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. All right. And then just stepping over to Packaging Resources, I wondered if you could just help us with the fourth quarter results, kind of unwind the cost of the Covington outage, both in terms of loss to volume and actual expense? And then give us some sense of what your market-related downtime was?", "James A. Buzzard", "Mark, this is Jim. I think if you think about the loss absorption of about $50 million for the quarter, roughly 1/3 of that was related to the downtime with the outage, and the other 2/3 is related to economic downtime.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "You said $50 million?", "James A. Buzzard", "Yes, that's what we're showing on the slides.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. All right. And then last question, just in terms of the first quarter guidance that you gave us, Mark, and the terms of earnings, what kind of tax rate is embedded in that? Is that the 32%?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "32%, Mark.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Gail Glazerman, UBS.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just kind of reconcile, I guess, the comments and what you seemed to be looking for in 2012 relative to the targets that you set out at the Packaging Day. I mean, are we just to think that probably you clearly missed the targets in 2012 but then have much higher than expected growth -- than targeted growth over the next couple of years?", "John A. Luke", "Yes, Gail, it's John. I think you've really answered that question. We're very committed to the 3- to 5-year target. As Mark noted in his comments, we certainly aren't expecting linear progress. We've laid the foundation. We expect to build on that foundation and lay an even stronger foundation as we move through 2012 when we feel very positively about those opportunities. I think on top of that subject to what happened and what is still logically a very cautious macro environment, some of that progress may be masked by demand trends in other parts of the business, but that no way diminishes our confidence in the merits of our strategy. As I commented with -- in response to Mark Connelly's question, it just reinforces the urgency and redoubling of efforts that we've put around it because that is going to be the key to the profitable growth ambitions and success that we fully expect to have over time.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And Mark, a quick question on the land guidance for the quarter. When you're talking about down, is that sequentially or is that compared to kind of the underlying normal performance last year x the large sale?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "We're going to be relatively lower even -- if you look at our fourth quarter of '11 in terms of land sales, we expect some slowing from that level, a very modest level of land sales in Q1. And this is all a function of timing. We do expect that to pick up somewhat in Q2. So down from Q4 then -- and then back to a more normal range in Q2.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And Mark, there's been a lot of noise lately on fuel tax credits and treatment. I'm just wondering if you could give an update if any of the recent developments would affect MeadWestvaco and if there'd be any cash to come through?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Gail, you broke up a little bit on that one, I'm sorry.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Sorry. There's been a lot of new developments and noise on fuel tax credits. I'm just wondering if there's any kind of legacy potential benefits from recent rulings?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Not that we're aware of. That's certainly nothing we've got forecast in our plans, Gail.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And just one last question, can you remind us of what your natural gas hedging policy is?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, we hedge on a rolling basis through the course of the year. And at this point, we're more than 50% hedged in nat gas for 2012.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I want to come back a little bit to the inventory reduction commentary and the macro overall. Coming out of the recession, the last one, what we saw in macro data, what we heard from companies was that inventory levels were being kept at very low levels relative to where they were prior to the last recession so that any future demand drop, if one arose, would be relatively modest. And I guess I'm asking, where in the supply chain do you think your customers had excess inventory where they were taking reductions, if you have that line of sight? And I guess the related question is, what do you think -- since so much of your key markets are driven by relatively stable growth consumer markets, what were your customers most reacting to in terms of drawing down inventory and reducing orders to you? And obviously, a lot about -- you have a lot of company in this, other companies in the industry, Europe, any specific factors within the U.S., I'd appreciate the color on that.", "James A. Buzzard", "Sure, George, this is Jim. Let me take a crack at that and look to Mark and John as well. I think you have to dissect the markets. And so clearly, in places like Europe, demand fell off more in the personal and beauty care markets where spending is more discretionary. And so I think we were reacting both to a falloff in demand, as well as fewer new product launches and things like that. In some of the other markets related to North America that may be more consumer-related, the consumer didn't pull their horns in. And I think it was a difficult environment. In the end of the third quarter, fourth quarter, we began to feel that falloff in demand more in November and December. And I think it really was our customers simply reacting to what they had seen a little bit earlier and tamping down their inventory. So I think you can always -- as things get soft, we've done the same thing to our inventory. You just continue to ratchet down harder and harder on it and make sure you're not coming into the new year with any excess inventory at all, and I think that's just what we're seeing.", "John A. Luke", "And I think -- I was just going to say and I think, just building on what Jim said, George, I think the fact that as we've punctuated, these are data points as opposed to anything that we'd call a trend. The fact that we're seeing in each of these areas modest upticks in demand speak to that very point.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "And this -- while there's certainly some of the supply chain management going on, George, you're right. It's not at the types of levels that we saw back in -- coming out of 2008 going into that recession. So it's -- there are some of it but not nearly as dramatic.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Yes, what I was getting at is to the extent inventories at the retailer store room as opposed to your customer room, so to speak, or warehouse, there's going to be a longer or shorter tail on whatever remaining inventory reduction is going to take place. But it sounds like -- you hope this is done by the second quarter, and you're seeing some improvement early on in January. I guess the related question I had, you're not going to make drastic reactions based on one quarter's demand trend and you're taking downtime, obviously, for the time being. But how do you feel about the flexibility in your manufacturing footprint, specifically within your bleach board system in the U.S.? Do you have the room if demand doesn't recover to economically further reduce production, or don't you?", "James A. Buzzard", "Let me take that and -- I mean, as we have in the past, we have the flexibility and we will react to the demand signals. So if our demand falls off, and I think Mark articulated that we would expect a low to mid single-digit decline in the first quarter, still better than what we saw in Q4, then we'll react to that. I think, as John said, at this point in time, again, while it's early and it's still January, we are seeing improvements over Q4. And so we're able to not have to do that.", "John A. Luke", "Yes, I think that's exactly right. And I think the reason we're cautious, and I'm sure others across a range of the industries are cautious, is that consumer confidence is the big question right now. And how that will influence demand as this quarter plays out, and as we move into the second, is something that we're all going to have to wait and see. And I think our customers obviously are managing their inventories tightly with that in mind as well.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. Last 2 questions, I'll turn it over. I'll ask them in sequence. First, can you give us a bit of color on the size of the coffee -- retailer or coffee cup opportunity for MWare that you discussed earlier? And corporate expense, it wasn't up much year-over-year, as I recall. I mean, it's relatively flat. It was up sequentially. There may be some seasonal factors in there. Mark, what opportunity do you have to take corporate expense down over time on a more structural basis?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Let me get that -- the second part of your question, George. We were up quarter sequential. That's not unusual in terms of what we see relative to some of the typical true ups on accruals that we do in the fourth quarter. But also, what we saw in Q4 was an increase in our stock price. And that impacted the non-cash cost at both our equity plans, as well as our deferred comps. So that was $9 million or $10 million of that increase, some true ups in accruals. And we did see some increased investment in terms of both product innovation and our commercial capabilities.", "John A. Luke", "And George, with respect to your first question on the cup business, these are 2 important customers, and we're very excited about the potential. Let us get those ramped up, and then we can come back and provide good feedback on the progress.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of James Armstrong, Vertical Research Partners.", "James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Two quick questions. First, on -- in the CNK, I guess, segment, historically, you've said that you have about a 50-50 mix selling in the beverage carriers and other products. Is that mix between beverage carriers and other products changing? And if so, what would the new mix look like?", "James A. Buzzard", "I think it was -- As I said, historically, it's more like 65-35 between the carrier business for the beverage and the non-carrier. Our growth rate is faster in the non-carrier at this point in time, so a slight mix change but not dramatic.", "James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Okay, that helps. And then secondly, on your Analyst Day, you mentioned that mid-cycle Specialty Chemical margins were -- you saw them in the mid- to high-teens. Given the strength in that segment, have you altered your long-term outlook on this -- on that number? And in addition, are there any new products in the division that have come out recently that could have impact on earnings?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "On the margins, we had continued to have strong margins in the fourth quarter. We expect to continue that type of trend into 2012. There's nothing on the immediate horizon that would suggest that won't be the case. And a lot of that is exactly at the heart of your question. It's all around innovation and new products and applications for our customers, particularly in oilfield services, adhesives and the asphalt marketplace. So we are expecting to maintain our margins primarily through innovation.", "John A. Luke", "I think that's right, and I would just add that innovation is really the hallmark of that business.  They've done a bang-up job over time supporting specialized applications in each of the principle segments of that business, and that's the key to growth and the key to success as we've defined it.", "James A. Buzzard", "Yes. And maybe just piling on for a minute, I think, as you look at the pipeline, as John and Mark have both said, that ongoing pipeline, I think some of the nice things we're seeing now on the asphalt business I noted, as budgets are tight and states and countries and province move towards maintenance and repair, we've got new products that are flowing into that, that are doing very, very well. In the carbon arena, I talked about honeycombs that go on the hybrids. And as those markets grow, we've got a lot of opportunity for growth there. And then with the boom in the oilfield markets, we continue to launch new products. So lots and lots of opportunity for innovation and continued good performance in that business.", "Operator", "And our final question is from the line of Alex Ovshey, Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "A couple of questions. On SBS pricing first, as we know, one of the trade publications modestly brought down their price number for January. Can you comment if any of your business is linked to that publication or any publication, whether you expect to see a negative follow through because of that decline in the list price?", "James A. Buzzard", "No. Unlike, I think, some of the corrugated volumes, we don't participate in the SBS market. We're not linked to a price like that.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, very helpful. And second, as I look out to China, a number of the local paper producers out there are very aggressively committed to expanding coated ivory board capacity. Can you comment on whether you see coated ivory board as a competing product to SBS globally and whether you're concerned about the capacity expansion that's happening out there in China in coated ivory board?", "John A. Luke", "Alex, let me just comment for a moment and invite Jim and Mark to follow up. I think the expansion certainly reflects the underlying growth trends that are underway in that market. They are substantial. And clearly, given choices customers have, any kind of paperboard can be viewed and must be viewed as a competing product. That said, our positions that have been built up and are very attractive are highly valued in the tobacco and liquid packaging markets. And we were seeing good growth there, and we're working hard to not only maintain those positions but to grow those positions with good service and good quality.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And just last question, if I may. Just the weakness that you're currently seeing in the commercial print, as well as general packaging and use for SBS, can you just give a little bit more color around where specifically you're seeing that weakness? Because what I struggle with, as I look at corrugated box shipments, they've been pretty resilient through the fourth quarter. And intuitively, it seems that corrugated box should be more economically sensitive than SBS but that's not playing out. So really the question is, in some of those end markets like commercial print, are there secular -- negative secular trends that you're fighting against that may be driving some of the volume weakness?", "James A. Buzzard", "This is Jim. I think, in terms of breaking them apart, commercial print, clearly, if you look over the last several years, there has been some secular decline in the advertising markets and others as digital advertising takes over. Having said that, we have what we believe is the leading product in the marketplace. We've been taking share. And while we were down a little bit in Q4, we have been growing in that business through the course of the year. In terms of general packaging, again, I think it goes back to what we said earlier, which is certainly some impact from the supply chain as people move to reduce their inventories and balance themselves out as they came at the end of the year. And as John noted, we're seeing some signs of improvements here in January, and so we don't see any secular decline at all in those markets that we serve. We think it's certainly a temporary situation around economy and supply-chain adjustments that are very positive for the long term.", "Jason Thompson", "All right. Kevin, let's wrap it up. Thanks everyone for joining us today, and I look forward to getting together with you next quarter. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Director of Investment Relations, Jason Thompson. Please go ahead.", "Jason Thompson", "Thanks, Suzanne, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced our results before the market opened, and a notification of this morning's call was broadly disclosed. Further, this morning's call is being webcast at mwv.com and slides that accompany this call are available there as well.", "I'll briefly remind you that certain statements we make are forward-looking and are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties described in our public filings. Furthermore, contents contain time-sensitive information that, although correct today, may change with the passage of time.", "All the results we share this morning are presented on a continuing operations basis. For the first quarter, the company's income from continuing operations was $49 million or $0.28 per share. Excluding special items, adjusted net income from continuing operations was $60 million or $0.34 per share. ", "Now here to tell you more about our results in the first quarter are John Luke, Chairman and CEO; Jim Buzzard, our President; and Mark Rajkowski, our Chief Financial Officer. ", "I'll now turn the call over to John.", "John A. Luke", "Jason, thanks, and good morning. Moving on the momentum of our strong performance last year, we have extended our performance with a solid start in 2012. Our profitable growth strategies generated increased top line sales and solid earnings during the first quarter. Performance that was gratifying given the continuing challenges in the global economy, especially the crisis in Europe and the related growth impacts in Brazil and China. We had year-over-year sales growth of 4% in the first quarter. This is a significant improvement compared to flat performance in the fourth quarter and this renewed growth included both volume increases in our Packaging and Specialty Chemicals markets, as well as higher pricing and product mix improvement. We also had a very good quarter of land sales and development activity in our CDLM business. ", "We're generating above-market growth in several of our end markets by executing our strategy focused on commercial excellence, innovation, emerging markets and expanded participation with new technologies and capabilities. This morning, I'll use these 4 pillars of our growth strategy as the context to share some highlights for our performance.", "First, commercial excellence, where we're working to become the most commercially proficient company in our industry by continuously strengthening our ties to the world's largest consumer products companies in order to earn a larger share of their packaging spend. As an example of our success during the quarter, we outpaced underlying growth in the beverage market, in part, due to contributions from a new product launch for AB InBev's Michelob ULTRA. This is one of the first solutions to hit the marketplace from the pipeline of projects we developed through our brand engagement work that our beverage team detailed for you during our meeting here in Richmond last December. ", "Second, innovation, where we're using insights to develop new solutions that deliver valuable benefits for brand owners, retailers and consumers. We had a few exciting developments during the first quarter. Two of our adherence packages, Shellpak and Dosepak, won awards from the Healthcare Compliance Packaging Council. This is an affirmation of the leadership position that we have built in this segment of the health care market. Also, during the quarter, we launched a new product, Shellpak Renew. It combines the same adherence-enhancing characteristics of our classic Shellpak with a fully recyclable paperboard format. Shellpak Renew is now in Kroger stores nationwide.", "Also at Kroger's, we're running the first store trials for Captivate. As you'll recall, Captivate is a shopper-ready packaging solution that can revolutionize grocery categories that are hard-to-stock, hard-to-shop and hard for brands to stand out on crowded store shelves. The early response to these trials is positive.", "Third, emerging markets, where we're using our existing leadership position to translate our market and consumer insights for the growing middle classes in places like Brazil, China and India. We had 5% growth in our corrugated business in Brazil during the quarter, compared to a reported industry average in Brazil of about 1%. This follows 2.7% GDP growth in Brazil in 2011 and annual projections of 3% to 4% for 2012. In China, where GDP estimates have been revised down to roughly 8% and many are closely watching trends in manufacturing output, we have low double-digit growth. Among the many highlights in China, we continue to increase sales of beverage multipacks as this format gains favor with consumers. In India, we have a modest presence and continue to proactively evaluate opportunities to expand our participation in that country where growth, while projected to be about 7% this year, is facing long-term, very attractive prospects.", "And fourth, under expanded participation, we're already gaining traction from the moves we have made recently to add to the range of solutions we provide our customers, namely, the acquisitions of Spray Plast and Polytop. Both had a positive impact on the top and bottom line results during the first quarter, notably in our food, beauty and personal care and home and garden sectors.", "With the profitable growth initiatives we have in place, you'll recall that we're aiming to add roughly $1 billion in profitable new revenue over the next 3 to 5 years. We're very confident in our ability to reach and exceed that ambitious target, including additional progress in the coming quarters and beyond. Essential to this growth strategy is our economic profit discipline, which means we are building a business model that ensures the growth we're generating create shareholder value with solid above cost of capital returns.", "Despite this confidence, the fundamentals in the global economy have not changed markedly, and we're still very cautious about the nearer-term impact of slower growth around the world stemming from the financial crisis in Europe. We are confident, however, that our growth strategies and business model enhancements will enable us to preserve and extend our momentum during these tough times, just as they did during the first quarter. ", "Jim will now share some more detail about the impact of these growth strategies on the performance of our business segments during the quarter. Jim?", "James A. Buzzard", "Thank you, John. As you know, we are reporting the results for our Global Packaging business in the new segment structure for the first time. This aligns our external reporting with how we are managing our Global Packaging business. And it is consistent with our strategy to drive profitable growth in large and growing packaging end markets. We'll focus the conversation today on these new packaging segments, as well as Specialty Chemicals and Land Management.", "In the Food & Beverage segment, we provide primary and secondary packaging solutions for frozen and dry foods, food service applications, soft drinks, beer and dairy products. This segment also includes results from our tobacco packaging and commercial printing businesses. Sales in this segment were up 5% from pricing and product mix improvement, as well as volume gains in Food & Beverage end markets. Earnings were down due to a planned maintenance outage at our marked facility where we make paperboard for retail food packaging and beverage multipacks. The outage impact was $9 million in the first quarter, and we also had unfavorable foreign currency exchange effects of $7 million. Commercial excellence initiatives including brand and packaging strategy engagements with our biggest Food & Beverage customers, as well as continued gains in emerging markets, are what drove better-than-market performance in the Food & Beverage segment during the first quarter, in the quarterly gain share in retail food packaging and had strong gains in liquid packaging in Asia. We also continued to establish our hot and cold drink cups in leading quick-serve restaurants and had a positive contribution in the quarter from Polytop's caps and closures from major food brand owners. ", "Overall, the market for food packaging continues to grow, with an emphasis on solutions that enhance freshness, convenience and product safety, and it also improved the consumer experience. We are well positioned to capture growth from these trends with our new products and solutions, including Captivate, Evertain, our replacement for the composite can and Polytop's differentiated caps and closures. ", "The market for beverage packaging was also strong, in part due to warm weather and promotions in North America and higher consumer activity in Europe. We gained share in North America with our first sales of Dr Pepper. That's the new business that we won last year. And we also had volume growth at our largest beer and soft drink customers that outpaced the overall market. We continue to convert customers to our paperboard solution for glass bottle multipacks, as well as introduce new packaging formats to the marketplace as part of our pipeline of projects we developed through our brand engagement process with AB InBev. ", "Our performance in Asia-Pacific was also strong. We have a relatively small multipack business in China, but it is growing rapidly. Overall, our outlook in these beverage markets is very positive, with a growing pipeline of innovation projects that deliver supply chain savings and stronger shelf differentiation across our global markets. ", "In the second quarter, however, we expect earnings in the Food & Beverage segment to be lower than the strong performance in the second quarter last year. We expect that uneven demand will keep volumes flat in developed markets, but we will have continued pricing, product mix and productivity gains. However, these improvements are expected to be more than offset by input cost inflation and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. ", "In the Home, Health & Beauty segment, we primarily serve customers with dispensing solutions for personal care, fragrance, home cleaning, lawn maintenance and over-the-counter health care products, as well as adherence packaging for prescription drugs. Sales increased about 2% during the quarter compared to last year, and earnings increased 50% to $12 million. Innovation and expanded participation in the marketplace, coupled with strong productivity gains, were the main drivers of performance in this segment during the first quarter. Sales of our proprietary adherence packaging for prescription drugs were up with our biggest retail customer, and we continue to make very strong gains with our medical pumps in Europe. ", "Overall, health care packaging volumes were up 15%. MWV is the clear leader in the growing adherence segment of the health care market, and we expect to remain the leader by introducing new products such as Shellpak Renew. ", "We've also had tremendous success integrating and growing the capabilities we acquired from Spray Plast and Polytop into our global platform for Home, Health & Beauty. We're cross-selling these solutions to existing customers, and the initial response from our global brand owners has been very positive. For example, we are growing our home and garden business in Europe with Unilever as a result of our Spray Plast expansion there. And with Polytop, we have new programs launching in late summer with major customers, including Scotts and BioLab. Our commercial success with these products help drive low-single-digit volume growth, which is better than the flat to negative growth the overall home and garden category has been experiencing. ", "Looking at personal care. Carton volumes were restrained by lower demand in Europe. However, we continued to partially offset weakness there with solid levels of business activity with major global fragrance houses utilizing our dispensing solutions. The global outlook for the markets we serve in the Home, Health & Beauty segment remains positive. We are beginning to see increasing leverage from the upfront investments we've made in our commercial organization and new product development. In the second quarter, we expect earnings in the Home, Health & Beauty segment to again improve. Higher volumes of our innovative health care and home and garden solutions, contribution from Polytop and productivity gains will be the performance drivers. ", "In our Industrial segment, we provide high-value corrugated packaging for frozen meats, fresh produce, personal care and household products and white goods, primarily in Brazil, and we are also growing this business in India. Sales and earnings in this segment were down slightly in the first quarter compared to a very strong period the previous year. We outperformed the broader industry during the first quarter by executing commercial excellence initiatives that focus on deep market insights. Our efforts drove share gains in targeted corrugated end markets for food and household products. As a result, our corrugated volume growth was 5%, outpacing the overall Brazilian corrugated market growth of less than 1%. That includes volume from our fifth box plant in Aracatuba, which positions us to serve customers in a broader area west of S\u00e3o Paulo. Expansion into this new geography, which is dominated by agribusiness, has allowed us to better serve new and existing customers in meat and other food markets. We expect to continue to increase our share of corrugated food packaging with this new modern facility. ", "The government in Brazil has made a number of moves to strengthen the economy, including lowering interest rates and taxes to promote investment and consumer spending. As the economy in Brazil continues to grow and the middle class increases consumption, we expect even greater adoption of the high-quality solutions we provide in this segment. That's why we've made the investment in the new paper machine to expand and improve our advantaged corrugated platform. And this machine is on track to start up in the third quarter. We are confident in the long-term growth prospects for the Brazilian economy, and the demand outlook for the end markets where we are growing our leadership position remains very positive. ", "In the second quarter, however, we expect earnings in the Industrial segment to decline. Benefits from volume improvement will be more than offset by lower price mix and higher cost as a result of the investments we're making in the new box plant in Aracatuba. Modest start-up expenses for the expansion project and unfavorable foreign currency exchange will also impact our results. ", "In the Specialty Chemicals segment, sales and earnings were higher in the first quarter, continuing the pace of improvement the team has set for more than 2 years. This performance was driven through commercial excellence and a strong lineup of innovative formulations that deliver quantifiable performance benefits to our customers. We gained share with our solutions for oilfield drilling and also saw increased volume for activated carbon as auto sales globally continued to recover. North America was particularly strong in the quarter, where auto volumes reached a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 15 million vehicles. These gains were accompanied by solid performance in segment solutions for paving, inks and adhesives resulting in overall volume growth of 8%. We expect to again generate year-over-year profit growth in the second quarter, but the comparisons get more difficult and we have a planned maintenance outage in the quarter as well. Nonetheless, we still expect solid growth and higher value performance chemical in carbon markets. ", "In Community Development and Land Management, the pace of rural land sales was seasonally slower in the first quarter. In the quarter, we sold a large forestland parcel, more than 12,000 acres for $20 million. The more than $1,600 per acre on this transaction is very good for the location in Alabama and has further evidenced that our segmentation process, as well as the quality of our land, is a true differentiator in this difficult real estate market. ", "Moving forward, the story in this segment increasingly will shift to the development side of the business, and excellent progress continues on our industrial parks and master-planned communities. There have been reports about the dearth of class A industrial space available in the Charleston, South Carolina market, due to insufficient investment in new manufacturing, warehousing and distribution space following the arrival of Boeing and other economic development projects. Because demand far exceeds the supply of appropriate space, we have prepared 2 ready-to-build pads at our industrial park joint venture with the Rockefeller Group, as well as made similar plans for our other industrial sites throughout the region. These sites will allow us to shorten the time to erect new buildings and will enable us to take advantage of this growing opportunity. And with the job creation that is associated with growth in Charleston, demand for mixed-use space and new residential housing will also increase. We are well positioned there with our master planned communities in East Edisto and Parks of Berkeley. ", "Earnings are difficult to predict for the Land business in the second quarter due to possible shifts in the timing of transactions. But based on the current pipeline of deals we expect to close during the second quarter, we expect earnings to be in the low-single digits. ", "Overall, each of our business segments is performing well, and we expect positive progress in each for the duration of this year. ", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark. Mark?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Thanks, Jim. The strengthened business model that we've created continued to perform in the first quarter, and our fundamental profitability remained solid. The profitable growth strategies we're executing drove share gains and higher sales of new products across our targeted end markets, resulting in both volume and price mix improvements. In addition, we continue to generate productivity through our operating excellence initiatives. The leverage from our improvement in these areas was masked by some unusual items in the comparable periods in foreign exchange translation. Normalizing for these items, our underlying operating margin this year was comparable to last year's 10% plus margins. The fundamental strength of our business model is also reflected in our year-over-year improvement in cash flow from operations of over $30 million. ", "Adjusted SG&A was up modestly, but as a percentage of sales was roughly flat with the prior year. As you know, we're continuing to invest in new capabilities and talent to accelerate our profitable growth. We're already seeing payback on these investments as reflected in recent share gains and continued improvements in price and product mix that Jim highlighted earlier. Our financial position remains very strong, which will continue to serve us well in these still uncertain times. When the Consumer & Office Products spin merge closes next week, we expect to receive roughly $460 million of cash. This amount, combined with cash on hand at the end of the quarter and the strong underlying cash flow from our businesses, will be more than adequate to fund our major capital projects, our ongoing capital needs, as well as our dividend. ", "Importantly, as we look past this near-term period of investment, we expect to generate significantly higher levels of cash flow that we will use to both reinvest to profitably grow our business and return to shareholders through a strong dividend. ", "Looking ahead to our performance in the second quarter, we expect total company earnings from continuing operations to be modestly lower than last year's record second quarter earnings. We expect underlying demand in the second quarter to remain stable, but uneven with poor visibility, particularly in Europe. We'll also continue to see the impacts from cost inflation and unfavorable currency translation. That said, we will continue to manage our business effectively given that environment, including the execution of our profitable growth strategies and continuing to deliver savings through our productivity programs. ", "Now I'll turn it back to John.", "John A. Luke", "Mark, thanks. To summarize, we're off to a good start in 2012. We're executing the profitable growth strategies we've laid out for each end market and we're getting results. Our revenue growth is in line with the long-term annual targets we've set, and we're pleased with our performance given the conditions in the global economy. You'll note that we focused our comments this morning on Packaging, Specialty Chemicals and Land, the businesses that will remain going forward following the spin-off and merger of our Consumer & Office Products business with ACCO Brands. We expect that transaction to be completed next week. ", "We're confident that this new company comprised of ACCO and MWV's Consumer & Office Products brands will be a leader in the industry, and we wish them and especially our MWV employees who'll become part of ACCO much great success. We're also confident that our remaining businesses will continue to generate positive momentum in the marketplace in the second quarter and beyond, as we pursue the significant profitable growth potential that we see in our markets around the world. ", "This concludes our prepared remarks, and we'd now be happy to address your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of the Ghansham Panjabi from Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "How would you characterize the first quarter volumes overall relative to, perhaps, your internal plan on -- if it was higher, was it mostly weather related in your view? Or was there any end market improvement as well?", "John A. Luke", "Ghansham, it's John. I'll start by giving a high-level comment. I think overall, we felt very positively about overall volumes. I think they were pretty much up across the board. Certainly, they could have been better, but I think given the backdrop of macro circumstances we were facing and developments in certain markets we felt positively overall. Jim?", "James A. Buzzard", "I think that's right, and obviously, given the breadth of the markets we participate in, we -- as I commented, we feel good about our Food & Beverage volumes, the home and garden season got off to an earlier start this year and point of sales are strong and so we expect that to continue in the early part of Q2. Having said that, clearly things like fragrance and some of the higher-end products in Europe are seeing some impact year-over-year. So on balance, we continue to feel very good with some ups and downs, as John said, based on the macro economy.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then on specialty cans, was there any sort of pull forward for asphalt paving just because the weather was warmer and maybe some new disparities [ph] were able to get some projects done earlier?", "James A. Buzzard", "No, not really. Actually, we're seeing a little bit of shift in that business where there's less paving of new roads, if you will, given some of the pressure on budgets. But given our new products that we've developed that are positioned in the preservation and the maintenance side of the business, we're actually picking up good share in that and that's what's driving the paving business for us this year. So we play in both categories but the new products are really helping us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "On the SBS side, the volumes there are only minus 1%. That's pretty good in the context of the industry and I know you guys are about, I believe, 50% or so of that is export. You talked about some strong trends in the Asia-Pacific. I was just wondering if you could maybe break apart how domestic was versus export and just remind us within the export how much of that's Asia versus Europe versus other.", "James A. Buzzard", "Phil, this is Jim. I'll take that. In terms of across-the-board North America and our export business, we again saw some positive growth in both. So in North America, we had good opportunities in food service, for example, with some new customers, new products around PLA were positive for us and we actually saw some share gain through our commercial excellence initiatives in the existing accounts. Again, we saw some pressure in some of the more commodity-oriented areas in North America, but on balance, good performance there. And in terms of overseas, our liquid packaging business is up. We've got a nice position, particularly in Asia, around aseptic packaging for milk and we saw -- continue to see good growth from our regional converters there. So again, it's some ups, some downs, but on balance, we felt very good about the relative performance.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So is your overall export business up year-over-year in the quarter?", "James A. Buzzard", "Yes, it was. It was up marginally. Stronger in Europe, down on some of the commodity parts of Asia, but again up in the aseptic part that I mentioned.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then on the Industrial side, you talked about the price mix pressures from the more standardized entry-level solutions there. So I was wondering if you could give a little more color around that. Is that something that's kind of developed more recently? Or has that been an ongoing challenge now that you break apart the numbers in a different way it shows, but just kind of wondering what's going on with that.", "James A. Buzzard", "Sure. I would characterize that more as mix than I would with price. And so with the new business, new plant in Aracatuba, we're moving into more of the food area, as I mentioned in my comments, and good profitable growth, good profitable business for us. But from a mixed standpoint, it is slightly less attractive than the overall business down there. But in sum [ph], we feel good about our growth performance relative to the industry, and we feel like we're on track to deliver the growth that we have planned for that business for the long term.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then a final question here for John. With the spin basically in the rear view at this point, maybe you could just talk about how you're feeling about the portfolio today and any other things you might consider doing, either in coming quarters or perhaps even coming years, just how you're thinking about how the company is positioned today.", "John A. Luke", "Phil, as we commented before, we're always evaluating the overall portfolio in the context of broader strategies and global opportunities for profitable growth. But I would say with this transaction coming to a close next week, the portfolio that we -- that represents MWV today is one that we feel very good about and are committed to growing profitably in each of the areas that we're continuing to focus the business on.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from CLSA.", "Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "A couple of issues related to the top line and obviously, it's nice to see top line performance, but I wonder if you could give us a little bit of better sense of what to expect, for example, from new product launches this year. You highlighted a couple. Are there more significant launches coming this year that are going to help on the top line? And then a second question related to acquisitions. It sounds like these Spray Plast and Polycap are -- Polytop are coming together a little faster than some of your previous acquisitions did and I'm curious why that might be. I mean, obviously, Calmar got off to a little slow start. But even as we go back further, some of the acquisitions didn't have as much impact as quickly. So again, I'm just trying to make sure I understand where the top line is going to come from.", "John A. Luke", "Great question, Mark. Let me answer it in a couple of different ways. First of all, I think the innovation pipeline is certainly one as we've described as robust. We have opportunity to both further introduce new products. Jim mentioned Evertain, I believe, a little bit earlier. We both touched on Captivate. While those are in the early stages, we see opportunity presuming what we're confident will be good market acceptance for volume growth in both of those areas as we move through the year. And there are other initiatives like that. The Shellpak Renew is one that we're confident about as well. And again, there are -- these are a few among many, many others. To your question about Spray Plast and Polytop, I think what we have learned and what we're very excited about in both cases, relatively small but specialized acquisitions, we have an opportunity with the go-to-market structure that we have in place today to leverage these technologies in a broader range of market segments and geographies than we were equipped to do earlier on. So the success, early success that we've talked about and that you've addressed is a direct result of our go-to-market strategy. And it's, with that in mind, that I would say that our focus from an M&A standpoint is, as we go forward, to deliberately work to identify opportunities that will extend our profitable growth strategy, enhance capabilities, enhance technologies like the Polytop and specific opportunities to extend our positions more broadly in the emerging markets we've targeted for growth.", "Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's very helpful. Just one more question. With respect to Rigesa, you talked about start-up cost and that sort of thing. Are your overall expectations for the Rigesa expansion in terms of both top line and contributions still what they used to be?", "John A. Luke", "Absolutely. We're very bullish on that. The project is coming along well. The market planning is coming along well. The work that Jim alluded to at Aracatuba is part and parcel of that. Our performance in the first quarter relative to the market in Brazil is an indication of the market position we have and the first quality team that we have in place to take us forward. So we're very encouraged.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Mike -- Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "First, you had mentioned that foreign currency was going to have a negative impact in the second quarter. Can you try, in order of magnitude, quantify that for us? And I'm also trying to understand whether that's kind of a quasi-onetime thing or whether the changes, if currency, then were not to move, if it kind of resets the earnings level. And so kind of on a go-forward basis, what we would see in the second quarter would be reflective of the earnings power of the businesses at the exchange rates in the second quarter?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes. Mark, on currency, as you know, that moves around, right? And -- but what's interesting in the second quarter, when you look at where both the euro and the real were in the second quarter of last year, they were really starting to hit peaks, okay? And those currencies currently as we outlook them for the second quarter of '12, both of those are more than 10% lower year-over-year for the second quarter. So that has a pretty substantial impact. And you can think about it as almost a 10% impact on earnings year-over-year. So it's relatively substantial. But these move and the currencies started to move down towards the end of the year. So what we're focused on really is ensuring that we continue to drive volume growth by winning new business, introducing new products, getting higher levels of pricing, improve product mix and continuing to drive cost out through our productivity program. So the currencies will always move. They happened to be a little bit extreme in the second quarter. But we feel very good about continuing to improve the fundamental margin growth in our business model.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay, that's helpful. So that was a year-over-year comparison you were making so it really was -- this is where the earnings power is. It's not like where you have kind of quasi-onetime...", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "No, no, no, that's right.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay, understood. And then second, you talked about input cost inflation, particularly in the Food & Beverage business, and you could see it was fairly significant in the first quarter. Can you help us understand what are the main drivers there? And in particular, I would have thought nat gas would have been working very much in your favor and if you could include that into the conversation, that would be helpful.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, Mark. Nat gas is working in our favor. And as we break down our, what we call, our primary input costs, we have energy materials and freight. Actually, energy year-over-year was favorable. The big sources of inflation for the first quarter was in materials and a lot of that we saw in our Food & Beverage segment. And what's driving that are a lot of materials that we use in our papermaking, such as TiO2, resin, starches and caustic and other chemicals. So those are the big drivers of input cost inflation in Q1.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "And presumably, that's also what you're looking to in Q2 to be the issue?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, yes, we are. And we expect to see maybe a little bit of moderation. So a little bit better, but still it'll be inflationary in Q2 as well but at a slightly lower level than Q1.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Great. And really quick, do you make money in China? You talk a lot about growth there, et cetera. Do you actually make money in China?", "John A. Luke", "We do. We do and we take in the same very disciplined approach, Mark, that we have talked about in other areas to managing our participation in any investments with an economic profit discipline and we are encouraged by the results.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman from UBS.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just following up on the inflation. Can you talk maybe, as opposed to year-on-year sequentially, what you're seeing?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Right. Year-over-year, Gail, we were up 3.5% roughly Q1 and that's down slightly from what we had seen in Q4. So while it's inflation, it's -- it is moderating. And as I said to Mark's earlier question, we're looking at inflation in Q2 that's slightly lower year-over-year than what we saw in Q1.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. Then I was just wondering sequentially [indiscernible] should fall in?", "John A. Luke", "Gail, you're breaking up.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Sequentially, I mean, are there any of those inputs that you discussed that are still rising that are a concern.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "If your question was, is there anything out there in terms of input cost items that are of any particular concern going forward, nothing, there's nothing significant. And as I said, we do expect some moderation in Q2 and beyond.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And in terms of the Home, Health & Beauty segment, in the past, kind of referring to the old CSG segment you've given us a little bit of margin goals and we've talked about maybe getting to 10% margins, is that still a good goal for the new segment?", "John A. Luke", "Absolutely.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And just finally, kind of going back to the demand side. When you look at industrial production for consumer nondurables, things like food, the overall volumes seem pretty weak and you're obviously taking some share, but I'm just wondering if you can comment maybe a little bit more specifically on some of the underlying market trends and whether or not you think it's kind of a new normal or if there's been anything on the supply chain that might lead to better volumes down the road.", "James A. Buzzard", "Gail, this is Jim. I'll take a crack at that. I think that, clearly, in the fourth quarter, we did see some adjustment in the supply chains where people were taking inventories down. We think that's largely behind us. We did not really see any impact on that in Q1. I think going forward, to your point, I think that it is uncertain as we talked about. I think given what's going on in Europe, certainly the weak growth in North America that we've seen, we expect markets for the near term to be somewhat modest in the developed economies. Having said that, clearly, our focus around innovation, our focus on the emerging markets and our commercial excellence, as well as our ability to drive the technologies John referenced in places like Spray Plast and Polytop around the world, those are all the things that are helping us to drive the growth, and that's what our strategies are built around and that's the focus that we will continue to execute against as we go forward.", "John A. Luke", "Yes. And I would just add, I think Jim has nailed that, Gail. I think the real thing as we look around the world and we're participating, as you know, much more broadly, Jim mentioned the innovation and the technologies, those will be the key differentiators. The overall consumption of Food & Beverage, I think we can safely say, will continue to be strong and grow as populations grow. But they will be mixed in the nearer term by some of the economic pressures that exist in various corners of the world, but that's where the differentiation opportunities for us represent the upside potential.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I guess maybe a quick one to start for Mark. Mark, considering your guidance for the second quarter to be down modestly on a year-on-year basis versus continuing ops, would one way to frame it be to look at last year's earnings per share, which I think were somewhere around $0.54 or so, take out Consumer & Office, on a tax effective basis, I think you'd be around $0.42, $0.43, if I did my math right, would that be the right relative frame of reference for 2Q in terms of your guidance going forward?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes. I mean, you got the CNOP numbers from second quarter last year. You can apply 35% tax rate on that and that's the right way to look at it.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, great. Bigger picture, back to Food & Beverage packaging. You obviously spent a lot of time going through Captivate and Evertain back at the Analyst Day in December and it seems like you have some trials here, at least on Captivate, this quarter coming up. Do you have anything else going on with Captivate or Evertain that is meaningful? From our trade checks, we haven't seen much of it in the market but want to see what else might be shareable from your vantage point in terms of market penetration?", "John A. Luke", "I think Captivate, we're proceeding at pace as we talked the Kroger trials that I've referenced, George, are proceeding well. Those will continue over the next several months. And we have a number of other initiatives that we're not prepared to go public on at this stage that we're very bullish about as well.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "John, on Captivate, are you selling to the retailer or are you selling to the brand owner to basically pull or push it through to the retailer?", "John A. Luke", "I think with the model, George, that we're working on is that it would be a product that is sold to the brand owner, but the retailer plays a very key role in the pull, the acceptance and the success in the store.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. Two last ones and I'll turn it over. First of all, on corporate expense and SG&A, more broadly, I think you had some good progress on corporate expense on a year-on-year basis, if I remember from the slide. Still, when we look at overall SG&A from MeadWestvaco, it's higher as a percentage of sales versus what we'd normally see, call it, 7% to 9%, 7% to 10% for the broader paperboard and packaging comparable universe. Mark, what progress do you think we should see in SG&A over the next couple of years as a percentage of sales? I know you want to invest for growth, but on the other hand, there seems to be a cost-savings earnings lever here that's yet to be tapped. How would we quantify it if you're in our seats?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes. George, a couple of things. One, what you're looking at, you got a little bit of apples and oranges, right? We've got a -- still in our continuing operations, we've got a Consumer & Office Products business that's got a business model that carries with it an SG&A rate of 15-plus percent, okay? So that's part of it. But we are very much focused on the efficiency of our spend. You are right, we are -- have been and continue to invest in SG&A that represents commercial capabilities, innovation, investments in emerging markets. And -- but at the same time, we are -- it's not all incremental. We are also identifying opportunities to take cost out in areas, back office and other areas where there's opportunities to do that. So some of this we're self-funding and that's what we're looking to continue to do. But ultimately, what it's all about is growing the top line and driving the profitable growth, executing on the growth strategies that Jim talked about. We will -- you can count on us continuing to be very diligent in terms of driving non-value-added cost out. What we want to do is really get the leverage in our model by driving the top line.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So we should be seeing the percentage decline even if the dollars move up?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes. And we're -- what we're working on is making investments, but finding other places to pay for it.", "John A. Luke", "Yes, and that's exactly right, George. We're very, very focused on that and I think Mark's response has reinforced that. And I would just add to what Mark has already teed up as areas of opportunity. I commented earlier, in response to Mark Connelly's question, about what we're seeing work very, very well in terms of our go-to-market strategy. We're finding that as we put that very much in place, not only are we getting the growth and identifying more growth opportunities to the point that Mark made, but we're also finding ways that we can be a whole lot more efficient. And so there will be efficiencies that we are targeting actively in how we're structured right down through our business units to have a much greater efficiency while not in any way diminishing the overall effectiveness of our strategies.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And on Brazil, just trying to reconcile the prior comments. Volume, you said, I think, grew 5% better than the industry. You said mix was really the factor in terms of driving negative pricing. By my math, your pricing per ton, even though I know you don't look at the business necessarily that way, it was down $3 to $4 per ton, so it was profitable growth, yet the segment was down in EBIT. So help us understand why there was profitable growth, yet you saw a decline in EBIT year-on-year and it was an even greater decline when you x out foreign exchange.", "James A. Buzzard", "Primarily, what you're seeing around the dollars per ton in the mix is we also had a shift, so we did not have nearly the significant external paper sales that we have, and those sales on dollar per ton basis are obviously -- are quite high and that was also part of the mix, as well as I noted as we are growing the Aracatuba business, good profitable growth, but it's in some of the markets that are not necessarily as differentiated as the overall mix.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "And some of that timing on those sales -- or some -- the impact was timing, right? We had a big push at the end of last year and just lesser push at the end of this first quarter.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde from Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I have a few questions. One is, I'd like to just come back to kind of Home, Health & Beauty first. If I go back and look at the numbers when you bought Calmar, you said that had about $410 million of sales and about $81 million of EBITDA, so about a 20% margin. Since then, you've added Spray Plast and Polytop and then all of this growth in the adherence pharma, yet -- and sales have grown, almost doubled, yet the EBITDA has not grown a lot and the margins have really come down. So can you help us understand what's going on inside the business?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes. Mark, let me -- I'll take the first shot at it, and Jim and John can chime in. But -- when you look at Home, Health & Beauty, roughly 75% of those sales is what you refer to as the old Calmar and Plastics-type business. And they -- those products, whether it's in home and garden, personal care and health care, in terms of our medical pumps and dispensers, continue to perform very well. They are growing and have EBIT margins in the high-single digits. And there's a -- as you noted, there's a lot of D&A that you'd add on top of that related to the acquisition. What we also have in there is a -- our Folding Carton business in Brazil and Europe, but predominantly Europe, that supports beauty and personal care customers. That represents about 10% of our sales. And with some of the issues and the crisis in Europe, we saw a big sales decline in our folding carton sales in Europe and they lost some money. And on the adherence side of health care, as you mentioned we are seeing solid growth and what you don't see is that we are continuing to invest fairly substantially in that business commercially and innovation to take advantage of our leading position because we expect that space to grow substantially in the years ahead. So while that business is growing, we are investing in it and it has more of a breakeven set of margins. So getting back to your original question, there is -- there are several pieces to this segment, and we are positioning certainly our health care for profitable -- significant profitable growth in the future. Our home and garden and beauty and personal care products, the old Calmar products, if you will, are performing well and we continue to expect to profitably grow that business. And folding carton has been a little bit tougher and that has been a function of some of the slowdown in Europe. So hopefully that helps get to the...", "John A. Luke", "And I just -- Mark, I'll just piggyback on what Mark has said because I think he's addressed it well, is that the overall objectives that you outlined in your question are very consistent with the objectives we have for the business. Again, as I've said in response to other questions this morning, the very focused, profitable growth initiatives we have underway are ones that will enable us to achieve those.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, well, it's much very helpful. The other area I wanted to ask about is industrial packaging and you're going to have a lot going on down in Brazil in the second half of the year with the ramp-up of the machine and I think you're shutting down a media machine at another site. Can you just walk us through sort of as we roll through the second half, what the financial impact of all of those moves is likely to be?", "James A. Buzzard", "Mark, this is Jim. In terms of -- we obviously feel very good about the long-term returns around this investment. We will not see a lot of those returns in the current fiscal year, to your point, given the timing of starting up the machine, the cost associated with the ramp-up and other things. The rebuild we're going to have on number 3 Tres Barras [ph] and then the impact of Lenios [ph], shut down all of that will be fairly muted in terms of the opportunity for returns in 2012, but we feel very good as we go into 2013, as all that capability ramps up about the opportunities.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "They will -- would that actually be a drag at all in the second half, Jim?", "James A. Buzzard", "No, it should not be a drag.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And the one other question I had is industrial packaging. I know that this acquisition in India is pretty small, but I'm just trying to understand why you'd be moving in there in the corrugated business, which, away from Rigesa in Brazil, is a business that Westvaco really moved out of over the last 20 years here in North America and why we don't see you going into India and some of the more value-added consumer-oriented packaging businesses.", "John A. Luke", "Mark, let me take that on. We are looking at India for a variety of market participation potentials, including the consumer opportunities that you referenced. We are actively evaluating what the right strategy should be, particularly with what has been elusive, but we have confidence will be the approval at some point in the not-too-distant future of foreign direct investment for retail, which will just lead to a further explosion of what is already occurring on -- in retail modernization there as well. As we have looked hard at India, we've also seen a significant opportunity for market participation, taking some of the very same technologies and know-how that have been a hallmark of our success. In Brazil, particularly with packaging that serves the agricultural sector, where waste and spoilage just as it was in the northeastern part of Brazil 10, 15, 20 years ago a huge problem, is very much a problem in India today. So where we can leverage -- one of the advantages we have and one of the things that excites us about the technologies we have developed is where we can export those technologies, that know-how, to other markets that will selectively give us significant opportunity to bring advancements through packaging a variety of sorts to the marketplace. That's very consistent with our overall strategies. And to the extent that corrugated, select participation in the corrugated market forges that opportunity as we believe it does, we're going to be proactive in pursuing those potentials.", "Operator", "And we have time for one last question and it comes from the line of Chip Dillon from Vertical Research Partners.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Just want to make sure we're clear, just to follow up to a earlier question about -- on the numbers for the second quarter. I know last year, I believe from operations you did about $0.54, and then of course, we would need to -- since you will start reporting Consumer & Office Products as a discontinued operations in the second quarter, we need to actually take that away from what you did in the second quarter, and I think I heard you say that. And is the right amount of dilution to use around $0.07, $0.08 a share?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "You can -- Chip, come on, you can do the math and it's whatever, look at the EBIT from '11 and apply a 35% tax rate and then divide that by the shares. So that's -- I don't have that in my head, but it's...", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "No, no, no. Well, if you do that, you get about $0.14, but I believe there's -- there are other offsets, right? Like the use of the cash that you're going get in that you have to make assumptions about. And also I believe from back when you made the announcement there would be some associated corporate expense reduction that would also offset some of the dilution. Is that correct?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Well, we've got -- as part of this transaction, we are providing transition services, okay? And we'll be doing that for some period of time depending on the service over 9 months or so, and we will get compensated for that. So some of those costs do get reimbursed.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Got you. And then just 2 quick ones to finish up with. One, can you give us an update as to how we would expect to see the cash used that you're going to receive in a couple of weeks, at least split between debt reduction, share buybacks and possible acquisitions? And then secondly, I know Jim had mentioned that we're going to hear more about development down in the Charleston area. My guess is that would be tilted, of course, away from single family. But are there opportunities in both multifamily and industrial? And should we see maybe even a couple of Rockefeller-type transactions like we saw last year, say, in the next 2 years?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Okay. I'll take at least the first part of that. Relative to use of proceeds, we -- as you know, we are going to -- have paid down, in essence, our 2012 maturities. We borrowed to do -- some of that will pay down the short-term borrowings. We're also going to use some of that cash to fund our project at Covington. And of course, we have cash there to also support the dividend. So we're going to remain, as we have balanced, in terms of how we use our cash.", "John A. Luke", "I think with respect to the second part, Chip, as Jim's comments indicated, we do see, with the dearth of industrial properties down in the Lowcountry area, opportunity with the expansion of Boeing's activities and activity driven by the port as well for the kind of transactions that you're talking about. But I think if you look at that area broadly, what we also see is that with the expansion of commercial and broader manufacturing activity, there is going to be, over the next few years, a real growth in jobs in that area as well. And that's going to spawn a range of opportunities for development on several fronts and we certainly believe that our land is exceptionally well placed to participate, and we're going to be at the forefront of any opportunities that we either can create or that come our way.", "Chip A. Dillon - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And so would that mean maybe in, let's say by '14, we could actually see maybe a higher level of earnings from that segment than we have been as -- even though you may have fewer acres being sold, you're selling them at much higher values?", "John A. Luke", "I think -- let me answer it this way. Jason read the forward-looking statement disclaimer early on. I don't want to get in the business of predicting, and as Jim noted aptly in his comments, this is a business that is difficult to predict in but with the fundamental trends there, frankly, I think, in many respect, they're the kinds of trends that we would like to see as Americans all across our economy today but they are singularly right there before us in the Lowcountry of South Carolina. We certainly would hope and expect that what you suggest that is more earnings coming from this area to be very much in our sights.", "Jason Thompson", "Okay, everyone, well, thanks for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you. And have a great rest of the day.

Ladies and gentlemen, this call is being recorded today, April 26, 2012. [Operator Instructions] Your speakers for today's call are Mr. James Rubright, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Steve Voorhees, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Voorhees, you may now begin.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Thanks, Shane. Welcome to RockTenn's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. This is Steve Voorhees, Chief Financial Officer. I'm joined by RockTenn's Chief Executive Officer, Jim Rubright.", "During the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discussed. We included a description of these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our 2011 [ph] Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q for the -- filed for the period ended December 31, 2011. During the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. We provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix to the slide presentation, which is available on our website.", "Jim is going to begin with a commentary on the performance of our businesses during the quarter. And then I will discuss the status of our integration, as well as non-operating items in our financial statements. After our prepared comments, Jim and I will be available for questions. Jim?", "James A. Rubright", "Thanks, Steve. Good morning. Our adjusted earnings of $0.97 per share reflected continued excellent performance in our Consumer segment. That was more than offset by the lower earnings in our Corrugated segment caused by the continued price weakness in domestic box and export containerboard markets and the seasonal demand and pricing bottoms we believe we experienced in January and February. The weak market conditions we faced in the maintenance downtime we took in the quarter had the greatest impact on our Corrugated segment, where sequential quarter adjusted earnings were down $0.31 per share, and that more than offset the $0.10 per share in other earnings improvements. ", "While the improvements in the market conditions in March and April have been modest to okay, we performed much better in March than we did in January and February. Quarter's actual earnings improvement over our pre-announcement resulted from better performance during the month of March than we estimated that we pre-announced expected quarterly results. But March can be a very good and a picky month and for us it was this year. ", "In the face of the quarter's relatively weak market conditions, we continue to achieve strong cash generated from operations of $255 million. And as Steve will discuss, we executed several very favorable financings that significantly improved our overall financial structure. During the quarter, among other cash uses, we reduced net debt $62 million, contributed $40 million to our pension plans in excess of pension expense, and we paid dividends of $14 million. The proceeds from closed plant sales essentially offset cash restructuring costs, and we paid $19 million in redemption premiums and issuance costs to retire our 9.25% 2016 notes and the balance of $746 million on our acquisition-related term loan B. ", "Comparing Corrugated segment earnings in Q1 to -- in Q2 to Q1, lower pricing reduced earnings $10 million; volume including economic and major maintenance downtime reduced earnings $22 million; and the net impact of wood, fiber and energy increased earnings $8 million. We completed major maintenance outages at our Panama City, Florence and Jacksonville mills, which reduced containerboard output by about 52,000 tons. And we took approximately 120,000 tons of economic downtime, primarily at our Jacksonville recycled containerboard mill and at our La Tuque and West Point white top mills. We also permanently closed our Matane, Qu\u00e9bec 176,000-ton-per-year recycled containerboard mill. It was a medium mill, and we took it down as required to balance our system capacity in the lighter capacity that we we're going to add to our Hodge and Hopewell mills through projects later this year. We expect it will take a very limited amount of white top economic downtime in the June quarter, no brown economic downtime, and it will draw down the containerboard inventories we built up in anticipation of the approximately 140,000 tons of major maintenance outage downtime that we expect to take in the June quarter. We also currently expect to run to capacity in the September quarter, and we see our primary challenge in it is meeting our overall system demand in our seasonally strongest period. Our overall corrugated converted product volume was up about 1% over the December quarter. Our strongest performers were our West Coast in Mexican operations and our recently acquired Corpak plants, and that acquisition is working out very well. ", "We continue to make progress restructuring our box plant system. We consolidated 2 more container plants in the quarter, bringing the total, since May 2012, to 9 plants. We've also completed some very detailed plants -- plans for plant performance improvements that will undertake in our box plant system that I believe will take somewhere between 18 to 24 months to complete. To that end, we are also significantly strengthening our dedicated box plant manufacturing improvement team with a number of people who recently became available and who have significant recent experience in successful box plant transformation activities. Although this is a long multi-step process, we're very optimistic about the results we'll achieve. ", "As I mentioned, our Consumer segment business has performed very well with strong sales in folding cartons, partitions and merchandising displays. Our overall revenues were up sequentially $27 million or 4% over, for the Consumer business, the seasonally weakest December quarter. Consumer segment EBIT was up $4 million sequentially, as higher selling prices and volumes more than offset higher commodities and materials costs, and the $4 million costs that were required in mini-maintenance outage we completed at our Demopolis bleached paperboard mill in February 2012. Segment EBITDA margins of 16.8% were up 190 basis points over the prior year. ", "Our Recycled Fiber business continue to generate low single-digit EBITDA margins in the quarter. Those margins are lower than the prior years due to 2 factors: the first is the lower nominal pricing for recycled fiber this year; and the second, possibly more important, is the fact that the spread between export and domestic pricing is at historic lows, which compresses the margin opportunities we have in our export business. If Recycled pricing escalates to last year's peak levels, and if export margins return to historic norms, we would expect EBITDA margins in this business to improve by as much as 100 to 150 basis points. ", "Our outlook for the next quarter is for slightly higher adjusted earnings in the range of $1 a share, as our higher maintenance outage costs and downtime will generally offset the improving export demand and pricing. April domestic sales to-date show good seasonal improvement in box demand, and if this trend continues, it could provide some upside to our current outlook. ", "Steve will now address our results and our progress on integration.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Thanks, Jim. Our trailing 12-month credit agreement EBITDA was about $1.25 billion, and free cash flow remained strong during the quarter at $72 million. We spent approximately $39 million more in capital expenditures than in the first quarter and the total of $202 million in fiscal year to-date. Our capital investments will increase our run rate basis over the next 2 quarters, for their total fiscal year estimate of $480 million to $500 million, as some of the larger capital projects began this quarter. We expect our run rate of capital expenditures to decline to $350 million by fiscal year 2014. We are very pleased that we completed the series of related financing transactions during the quarter. These transactions included the retiring of $300 million in 2016 notes. We are paying $746 million of our term loan B, funding the new $227 million term loan A2 obtained in December and issuing $350 million of 4.45% 2019 notes and $400 million of 4.9% 2022 notes. These transactions enabled the removal of security from our Senior Credit Facility, and along with the expiration of an interest rate swap, have reduced our annual interest expense from a rate of $128 million per year to $112 million. This is a $16 million reduction. At the end of March, our net debt was $3.4 billion, and our credit agreement debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.8x. Liquidity was $1 billion at the end of the quarter. Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity are in very good shape and are able to support our business. ", "We made substantial progress on the integration during the March quarter. During the quarter, we essentially completed the conversion of the legacy Smurfit operations from SAP financials to JD Edwards. We started using natural gas at the Stevenson mill in January. This project reduces our annual energy costs by over $10 million. We are capturing the benefits of integrating the supply chain of the larger corrugated packaging system and accumulating purchasing savings available to us. ", "At the end of the March quarter, we have achieved a run rate of synergies and performance improvements in excess of $150 million. In the current quarter, the benefits of these synergies and performance improvements have been more than offset by lower market pricing and lower mill volumes. We continue to expect to achieve our target of a total of $550 million in synergies and performance improvements as we capture the opportunities available to our combined organizations. ", "Turning to our key cost inputs, wood cost increased compared to the December quarter by nearly $1 per ton. This is in line with seasonal patterns and offset by the decline in recovered fiber prices of about $11 per ton in the quarter. We continue to benefit from the decline in natural gas prices. The 12-month NYMEX strip at the time of our last conference call was approximately $3 per MMBtu. Today, it is approximately $2.70 per MMBtu with current cash prices of about $2 into the pipeline in most areas of the country. ", "On the last call, we described the project with Solvay to convert financial gas from a coal-based third-party steam supply by the end of this fiscal year. We now expect the conversion to occur during the second half of fiscal 2013, in line with our updated expected timing of the permit and construction schedule. ", "Turning to our guidance for certain financial statistics. We've made a slight reduction to our depreciation and amortization for the year, from $550 million to $540 million, as spending will occur a little later in the year than we estimated. We expect corporate and interest expenses for the June quarter to be $26 million and $28 million, respectively. Our book tax rate for the March quarter was 38.6%. We currently expect our book tax rate in fiscal 2012 to be between 37% and 38%. Our cash tax rate will be substantially lower, as we use our available federal net operating losses and other tax credits on our books to reduce cash taxes. Our unused cash items aggregate to approximately $366 million and reduced federal cash taxes. In addition to these items, there's also an unrecorded federal net operating loss related to the potential taxability of the Smurfit-Stone black liquor tax credits claimed as an excise tax credit. If we are successful on this issue, the cash benefit of our unused tax items will increase by $227 million to $593 million. We also completed our calculation of the IRS Section 382, the one associated with the Smurfit acquisition, and have concluded that this will not limit our ability use the net operating losses in future years. ", "As we disclosed on our last conference call, we've conformed the accounting for major maintenance outages in the legacy Smurfit-Stone Mills through RockTenn's policy of recognizing the expense ratably over the period from the time incurred to the next scheduled outage. In the March quarter, we recognized $7 million in maintenance outage expense, more than the $5 million in the December quarter. This expense will increase as outages occur. We expect this expense to increase to $18 million and $20 million in each of the last 2 quarters of this year. ", "That concludes my planned remarks. Jim and I are now available to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from George Staphos.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "First question on the integration efforts, synergies, performance improvements. You mentioned that you're pleased with your progress, if I heard you correctly. Are there any projects at this juncture that are trending better than expected either in terms of results or in terms of your process? And similarly, are there any projects that are maybe trending below expectations or maybe a little bit behind on in terms of implementing? And then I have a couple of follow-ons.", "James A. Rubright", "Let's say we're net probably about where we thought we would be. I think we've concluded that the performance improvements we expected to get out of our mill system are taking a little more time than we had anticipated and will require some capital, so that's part of the delay. But on the other side, looking down the road, as I've indicated, we think we've got greater opportunities than we thought on the box plant side, and we've got very detailed plans there to execute, and been part of it is an issue of just staffing up to able to execute the plans and then training and execution of people in the plant. So I think we're probably going to see this move out into our fiscal 2014 year. But in the end, I think we will meet our targets comfortably.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. So Jim, on the mill side, just to be clear, maybe the implementation is taking a little bit longer relative to what your expectation would've been on the last conference call.", "James A. Rubright", "Well, yes, I think that's as accurate as I can be.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. In terms of the measure in talent that you're adding in Corrugated, have you made any changes within the existing organization within Corrugated and the box network, or are these purely adds? And in general, how is the organization yields, Smurfit versus the old RockTenn, how is that meshing together at the juncture?", "James A. Rubright", "We're doing both. We're certainly taking advantage of the opportunity to upgrade staffing throughout the system where we can, and we're adding significantly to the expertise of our corporate resources, which we think we need to do. George, if you go back and look at the time we acquired Smurfit, they've closed 55 box plants, and their data would suggest that they had taken the average box plant costs to basically system average for the industry. Well, average cost doesn't win, and average cost is not acceptable to us. And so it's -- we've had to basically do the work associated with strengthening the team across the board to be able to significantly move that number down, which we are in the process of doing and believe we will continue to do. I think culturally, the organizations have come together very well. Jim and I, Jim Porter is here with me, we're out all the time, and I think people are very, very supportive of the transaction and where we want to go. We just have to get the skill levels up and support them with the right capital and processes.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Last question, and I'll turn it over. By the fourth quarter, you expect to be running to capacity. You'll also be certainly reasonably complete on your projects maybe. You said those are going to take into the beginning of fiscal '14. But will you be in a position, over the next few quarters, to make the next structural changes to your capacity footprint, or is that -- do you anticipate not needing to make any additional changes other than Matane?", "James A. Rubright", "First, with respect to the projects, there are 2 that relate to increasing the linerboard product line or capacity of our system. One is at the Hodge mill, and Hodge goes down basically very soon and through May. Then the second one is an increase in capacity at our Hopewell, Virginia mill. That occurs during the fourth calendar quarter of this year. As you know, startups will then take sometime, so we expect that production to ramp up in the periods after that. We also have a significant amount of process changes at our Stevenson virgin medium mill. That will be into the next year's outage season, as well as a pretty significant de-bottling of the cost structure at our Florence mill, starting with major improvements that will basically rebuild the wood yard. So these projects are going to take -- these are going to unfold over the next at least 6 months to 9 months. So you will see step changes in the capacity and cost structure and then, as I've indicated at the time that those things incur, we'll make judgments regarding what the market demand for our capacity is.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Phil Gresh.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So just I wanted to ask, if it's possible, if you could give any color around what the fourth quarter might look like. Coming off the third, you have a significant reduction in downtime. It sounds like the repair costs are kind of flattish. You should have some synergies perhaps kicking in. There's going to be some seasonal strength, so looks like it could be up pretty meaningfully, and -- so I was wondering what kind of color you could give us there.", "James A. Rubright", "Well I think you've just done it. The fourth quarter should be a very, very solid quarter for us, significantly better than the last couple that you've seen. Pricing environment and export pricing environment are not as favorable as they would've been in the September quarter of last year, so a lot of the work that we've done, a lot of the cost improvements are going to be offset by the market developments. But we expect a very strong fourth quarter, and then building off of that as we go through the seasonal period of the following year.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And as you exit this year, where do you think the synergies and performance improvement run rate will be? I think you're tracking above 150 at this stage. Any kind of ballpark you can give us for that as you're exiting this fiscal year?", "James A. Rubright", "The major buckets for us, as I've indicated, are in the near-term capital-associated projects in our mill system. So you're going to see them ramp up over the next 6 to 9 months, and I'm not really trying to quantify them, but it's a material amount of money in the aggregate. We've indicated that Hodge and Hopewell are projects that have -- that appear to have 35%, 40% returns just based on cost takeout in the mills. So in general, the aggregate capital on those projects is well over $150 million. So that should come on in the next 6 to 9 months, similar really pretty strong return off of the $40 million at Florence and so forth. So you're going to see that -- those returns come on over the next 6 to 9 months. The box plant improvement program is going to be a longer-term plan. We've got the initial closures, and those closures are in the $150 million that we've mentioned. By the end of this calendar year, we'll do 3 more natural gas conversion projects in large mills, and those, at current gas price levels, are going to add another $40 million a year in run rate of improvements, and we've included -- that's all included in the bucket of performance improvements that we've indicated. The next major administrative steps are IT and accounting-relating opportunities that we have. But -- although we've converted from JD Edwards to -- to JD Edwards from SAP in the financial systems, the major transformation effort is going to be in the box plant systems, where we've said we're currently at 6 legacy Smurfit procure-to-pay systems, all of those are going to be replaced with Kiwi, and that is about a 12-month project which we're kicking off today. We had to get the financial systems at the home office on the JD Edwards to do that in a logical way. That's a year project, so there's -- as we've indicated, it's a pretty long tail before we begin to realize a number of administrative and IT savings that fall out of the acquisition, but that's just the pace at which we are able to achieve them. The other thing that we'll continue to ramp up, I think we've got another $30 million or $40 million we're going to get out of procurement savings, and I think you can see that coming over the next 6 to 9 months. Steve, wouldn't you agree that that's the right schedule for that?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Yes.", "James A. Rubright", "There have been some other bits and pieces of synergies, but I think I've given you the best guidance I can on what we foresee.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "That's helpful. One last question. There is a -- there are a couple of mill closures over in Europe, particularly one on the craft liner side. Have you seen any impact on your export business already from that, and do you expect that to have an impact in the coming quarters?", "James A. Rubright", "We do, actually, and we are seeing a little bit of improvement in the European markets. Europe strengthened for us, and we increased our participation in European -- our exporting to Europe. It's a relatively small market for us, but we definitely saw some improvement. The Middle East continues to be probably the weakest market in -- that we export to. As long as I am continuing -- some pretty strong competition in Latin America, our largest market, but we are seeing improving pricing. And for craft liner, China, actually, was improving modestly for us.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Mark Wilde.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Jim, Steve, a couple of questions about -- around pricing. First of all, can you just give us a sense of sort of the recovery that you're seeing in export pricing maybe from the second quarter average to where we are today or where we were at the end of the second quarter?", "James A. Rubright", "I'm not going to be very specific there, Mark, for competitive reasons, and they are reasons you're aware of. But we're seeing modest but continuing improvement in export markets. And as I've indicated, I think the Middle East is the most challenged, but it's relatively small for us. And we're seeing -- we are seeing -- we did realize and we expect to continue to realize higher prices, particularly in Latin America, which is our biggest market. But that's as much detail as I feel I can go into.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes. And then you also -- you've singled out some pressure in box pricing. Has there been any change there from what we've seen over the last 2 years, which has been this kind of slow gradual erosion in box prices?", "James A. Rubright", "I think it's too early to tell because we've come through a seasonally weak period. And as I indicated, our April box sales have been up significantly over the prior year. But that's happened in the last 3 weeks, and there's a lot, I think, going on in the marketplace. But it's really too early to see whether there's a trend developing with respect to pricing.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then you -- just 2 others on price. You mentioned in the release, SBS pricing being down a bit, and then finally, the -- that West Coast medium announcement that you had out there didn't seem to get reflected in the trades this last week.", "James A. Rubright", "That's correct, it did not.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And the SBS pricing, is that kind of across the SBS business or more in some grades than others?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, it certainly affects our folding grades. And as you know, there we have contracts. So over time, you will see that get reflected in the contractual-based SBS tons and also pretty much immediately in the spot turns.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And on the cost side, Jim, do guys have any outlook on where you think OCC might be moving over the next few months?", "James A. Rubright", "Absolutely. We would say that it's flat for the next month, trending up $15 to $20 for the remainder of the year. But you'll recall, last quarter, I expressed some skepticism at our forecast that by the end, that would be trending up now to last year's historic highs. So I guess I'm most comfortable saying that right now, we're essentially in the trading range with weak export demand. And until something occurs to change the current paradigm, I see relatively flat pricing going forward. But that's a personal view, where the most I've got comfortable saying I have a low degree of confidence in my ability to forecast OCC pricing.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes. And would you say that the kind of limited rebound that we've seen so far is a result of kind of weakness on the export side as opposed to anything in the domestic side?", "James A. Rubright", "You mean rebound pricing down?", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "No, I mean, rebound pricing up. I mean that we started to see prices bounce in January and February, and now it seems like it just kind of flattened out. And I'm just trying to get a sense of is this mainly the result of weaker Chinese demand or are there other issues here?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, if you go back a couple of months, you get into seasonal generation issues, where you hit a period where fiber is historically relatively high based on low generation, and you saw a little bit of an increase. But I think China's export demand has pretty much followed the general economic trends that we're all seeing at the slowing in China, and it has had a fairly long-term effect on the fiber market. And that's what I'm saying. Until that market place changes, I think you're in a trading range with potentially -- some domestic supply lowering price or at least balancing the seasonal uptick in mill demand. So there's -- I just don't see a lot is going to knock it significantly out of the trading range that it's in until something spectacular happens.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chip Dillon.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "First question, and I apologize if these were asked, just on the -- on your view toward sort of the next leg of growth, that it seems like this is from discussing a lot of the challenges in assimilating Smurfit-Stone, which obviously is a big transformative deal, that maybe you would feel more comfortable not being active now, or do you feel -- still feel that would not be a factor, that you could -- whether it's an opportunistic -- a few facility acquisition or even something larger? Is that something you feel you could handle at least from an operational standpoint now?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, yes. I mean, I think if you look at the resources that's required to analyze an effect of a significant transaction, those of us who would be involved at the front end are available to do so. I think we've gotten -- we got great resources in the mill system. We've effectively realigned the leadership there and are stable and improving. Similarly on the box plant system, I think that's where our largest challenges are, but we've got a lot of people in a very large box system. So to integrate assets there would be fine. We've done very well, and I indicated with our acquisition of Corpak, so I would say we're open for opportunities.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Got you. And on a second matter. I know in the past, I seem to recall that you all were pretty vocal, at least in terms of issuing press releases, when there were price changes, especially on the consumer packaging side, and have you thought about changing that sort of practice and -- or at least as it regards to the containerboard side of the business?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, we have changed that practice. We've stopped issuing those press releases. We now advice our customers directly regarding our pricing through letters and individual communications rather than a general industry-wide communication.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Got you. And could you share with us sort of what made you change your view about that?", "James A. Rubright", "Our belief is that it's a better course of action for us to follow.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Got you. And then the last question. If I think about it broadly, when you get through with the Hopewell startup, I believe that's the last big mill project, I believe you'll be pretty much left with just the box plant. I know this -- that's a lot of work, don't mean to say just, but the box plant initiatives. But is it fair to say that once you get past Hopewell, that we should start to see a dramatic slowdown in activity in terms of what you need to do to get to the synergies that you expect the $550 million?", "James A. Rubright", "No, I don't think that's correct at all. We think that there's significant opportunities to increase the productive capacity of our existing craft liner system. I think if you go back a couple of calls, what we indicated is we don't think those assets really are performing at what we would think of it be in the industry standard rates given the capabilities of those mills. And the issues are many, whether it's deferred maintenance, training, staffing, strategic capital. We think there's opportunities to significantly increase the productive capacity of our craft mill system by as much as 250,000 tons, which I think it will take us -- we had indicated before that we thought it'd take us till the end of fiscal '13. Now it might take us a little bit longer than that. It's been slower than we thought, getting traction, but certainly, if you just benchmark what those assets should be capable of producing versus what they are, that opportunity, we believe, is there and have not changed our view on that.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "And that's above and beyond the Hodge and Hopewell projects?", "James A. Rubright", "Yes.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Mark Weintraub.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Just to clarify on that last point, so Hodge and Hopewell is about 300,000 tons or so in terms of incremental capability. And then beyond that, there's another 250,000 tons. Is that about right?", "James A. Rubright", "Yes, the initial target for us was slightly over 600,000 tons of craft liner production increase, which -- although some of that is me and based on performance improvements. But we have broke down -- we exited the craft bag market, and that increased our craft liner by 120,000 tons. We've already realized that. It's at Hodge, and it also allowed us to close 1 small craft paper machine in Hodge. The project that we're about to undertake will increase capacity -- the numbers slipped from my head, but it's another -- yes, another 107,000 tons, I think, of craft liner at Hodge, and that also reduced as the mill from a 3- to a 2-machine mill. Hopewell adds another 100,000 -- I think, 120,000 or 130,000 tons capacity. So those are the big chunks right there. But that then leaves, as I mentioned, about 250,000 to possibly more of capacity that we believe we will add through essentially our performance improvements at the remaining craft mills.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay. And that was included in the additional 250,000 or whatever is included in the $550 million. And I guess the timing on when you would do that is relatively open-ended at this point.", "James A. Rubright", "Well, as I said, I think our initial belief was we could have the vast majority of all this completed by the end of fiscal '13, that's September of 2013. I would revise that now to suggest it's going to run into 2014, both because of what we see in terms of the ability to move the box plant system and the pace at which we've been able to achieve improvements in the craft mills.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay. And you indicated that fiscal 2014 you thought CapEx would be trending back to about a $350 million-type level. And so can you give us a sense on 2013, is it roughly where you'd expect it to be?", "James A. Rubright", "We -- our trend was $480 million to $500 million. $400 million in 2013 and $350 million as sort of a sustaining rate in '14 and the out years. This summer is when we will really refine our estimates with respect to '13 capital, so I don't have an update there. To a certain extent, it's going to be depending upon this pace at which we are able to execute the projects that we've got on the plate for the remainder of this year because we do carry out a significant amount of capital. And we also have a very continuing updating capital process at RockTenn, probably different than most companies. So we're continually revising and updating our capital plans. So I would say that in July, I should be able to give you a better picture of '13 capital. But today, I don't have information better than the $400 million that we have been estimating.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay. And then lastly, you just noted that your -- that the box business in the first 3 weeks of April has looked to be up significantly. And I think you suggested maybe there were some industry dynamics maybe related to some other consolidation activity. Would that be the explanation, or is it do you think that the industry itself is picking up quite significantly?", "James A. Rubright", "I think that what I can see from our sales is a month-over-month improvement I think I misspoke too because the improvement that I referred to was really April over March in box cut-up, and I don't -- and the data, year-over-year, I don't have in front of me. But I'd just be speculating if I try to explain why.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay. Fair enough. And so that may in part also be seasonal, April picking up over March?", "James A. Rubright", "Yes, and it was delayed because we would have expected to see it sooner, but we are seeing it now.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Mark Connelly.", "Kurt Schoen - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "This is Kurt Schoen in for Mark. So you noted in the release that consumer packaging benefited from higher display sales. Were these higher sales more a result of the market share gain from acquisition or more due to seasonality? And do you expect more competition going forward given the higher margins?", "James A. Rubright", "The increase in sales was a function of customer demand in the period, and it relates to the promotional activities of the customer base itself. Those aren't necessarily seasonal, and they're based on decisions that our household name consumer product company customer base makes, so I don't have a reason for the increase better than customer decisions and customer demand. The display business has always been competitive. On the other hand, we have now, with the acquisition of Smurfit, putting together, I think the 2 largest display platforms in North America, tremendous capacities that we're bringing to the marketplace. And we're -- we think that we will grow relative to the competition based on the opportunities in front of us and the capabilities we bring to that marketplace.", "Kurt Schoen - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "All right. And then the second question is you guys noted that the West was a little stronger for containerboard. What was the reason for that?", "James A. Rubright", "I didn't say for containerboard. I said the places where we're having the greatest success in the marketplace and our operations are performing the best were the West Mexico and the recent acquisition.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Al Kabili.", "Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Jim, I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate a little bit on -- I think you mentioned you're as confident as you've ever been on the magnitude of the performance improvements, but the timing of -- is maybe slipping a little bit versus your original hope or expectations. I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that, number 1 . And then number 2, does any of that have any risk to the capital required to achieve these improvements?", "James A. Rubright", "Yes, I don't know that my view has changed a lot over the last 6 months. I'm trying to recall what we said in the last conference call. There I was -- I think I forecasted that we had felt a lot better about the opportunity set in the box plant system, and we were in the process of really developing some plans. Now those plans are much more concrete than they were, so I've got better visibility. I think I know exactly what our opportunity set would be and how we'll execute it. I also indicated that I think that I was aware then that the pace of mill improvements was slower than we had initially anticipated. And so I think that the net of those kind of balanced out to the same number, but the process is taking us a little longer than I thought. And I guess that's my view.", "Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And to clarify, though, from a CapEx perspective and a capital perspective, it -- your -- the expectation there hasn't changed, it's more of a timing.", "James A. Rubright", "Yes. I think that I see more opportunities to deploy capital in the box plant system in small amounts, but lots of small projects than I would have. So if capital were going to go up, it would probably go up on strategic capital deployed in the box plant system because we really do have a lot of opportunities there. I don't have a change of view on the capital in the mill system.", "Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, that's really helpful. And then just switching to the Consumer segment. You mentioned the backlogs improving there. Is that do you see that as end market strength you're seeing driving that or is that more seasonal factors from what you can tell right now?", "James A. Rubright", "I don't recall saying that we had seen backlogs strengthen in the Consumer business. In fact, SBS and CRB backlogs have been stable at relatively low levels for the last period of months. I don't know how many. And SBS operating rates have been in the low 90s, while we have been okay in the CRB business, and the only mill we've been taking downtime is in Stroudsburg, which is a very specialty CRB mill. Those markets I don't think have strengthened, so I'm not sure what you were referring to but...", "Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, that makes more sense. For some reason, I looked at it as on --", "James A. Rubright", "Steve has shown the [indiscernible] majority of [indiscernible]", "Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "On Slide 12 on your 3Q outlook in the presentation, it said SBS and CRB backlogs...", "James A. Rubright", "[indiscernible] in CRB, we expect seasonal strengthening. You really hit June, for example, is typically a pretty strong month as people roll up into the July sort of vacation period from closure period, temporarily consumer products plant closure in July, and then September is our strongest period, so I think what we're saying is we anticipate seeing backlogs improve and demand improve in those grades, but I can't say that we're seeing it today, so I'm sorry for the confusion.", "Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. Now that's helpful. And then last question is I know you mentioned the strength and the display sales. I mean, it looks like, just from the production data, your recycled paperboard overall seems to be outperforming the market, and I was wondering, your thoughts on how sustainable that might be.", "James A. Rubright", "Sure. We had a fairly long period of outperformance in the folding carton and CRB marketplace. I think we've got terrific people, was very dedicated to their customers and very strong customer relationships, both with independence, and we serve with CRB and with our major consumer product and local account folding carton customers. So I think there's a lot of momentum there, and that momentum ought to be sticky, but they are relative weaker markets today than they were a year ago, so certainly, they're competitive.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Phil Ng.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Sorry I've joined the call a little late, so if you guys mentioned this, I apologize. But just on the export market, you've seen demand bounce back a bit. How much of that do you credit as real demand, or is that more of a function of restocking, potentially some pre-buying?", "James A. Rubright", "How would I know that? Right? These are export markets where we're exporting into seasonally strengthening agricultural markets in Latin America, Europe. As we've indicated, we've seen [indiscernible] capacity closures and an improvement in the demand situation. We're simply responding to the market signals that we're getting, and the market signals are driven by whatever the market is driving. I apologize for not really trying to answer that question, but I don't have a view.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "But you're seeing it could flow-through into the April so far, I guess, is that fair?", "James A. Rubright", "Yes, we're speaking about current conditions.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then the box market, that market has been pretty competitive. But between you and one of your major competitor, you guys are taking some capacity out. Do you feel like, from a demand-supply perspective, things are pretty well-balanced now?", "James A. Rubright", "I'm not sure what segment of the markets you're referring to. I think the containerboard mill operating range, they've been running around 95%, haven't they? And so if you think of the average containerboard operating rate in North America for a pretty significant period of time is 95%. Would I like 97%? Yes. But 95% is not bad. There's lots of capacity in conversion capacity in North America.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just lastly, display business was quite strong, and I know promotional activity was -- you saw a pretty good flow-through in the current -- in the past quarter. Are you seeing that same type of momentum in the current quarter?", "James A. Rubright", "I think it's more normal trends that we see now. We think that the second half of the March quarter saw a lot of promotional activity. So it's going to cool somewhat if the current trends continue.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And that ticks back up in the summer, right, if I'm correct?", "James A. Rubright", "It ticks back up when it picks up. It is not easily predictable.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Steve Chercover.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "You anticipated one of my questions on the benefit of your next 3 gas conversions. I think you said $40 million under current prices. So is there a level of natural gas where the benefits go away? And can you flex your fuel source if that's the case?", "James A. Rubright", "Steve, the current MMBtu equivalent oil/natural gas prices at $3 multiplied by almost 7, 7.5, so you get the $18 to $20 would be the equivalent MMBtu conversation for oil. So when we take oil out of a mill and substitute natural gas, that's the gap, and that gap has to narrow in order to eliminate the natural gas advantages. It's a pretty big advantage.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Yes. And you do --you guys know a thing or 2 about gas so -- my other question was just with respect to the maintenance expense delta. So it's going to be up $11 million over Q2, if I read the slides correctly, and then economic down will be significantly lower. So if we just think of the opportunity costs, Q3 ought to be at least as good if not better. Is that fair?", "James A. Rubright", "Well I think we said we thought it would be about the same, slightly better. If we see this continuing upticks in the demand, it could be upside from what we forecast. But right now, we've said we think it's all going to net out to something like $1 a share.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Josh Zaret.", "Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC", "Can you tell us how much you built your containerboard well stock-up your inventories in advance, ahead of the downtime got started, I guess, in February?", "James A. Rubright", "We can, but somebody is going to have to hand me the number.", "Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC", "And then as well how much do you plan to pull down in the third quarter?", "James A. Rubright", "Josh, we have about 150,000 tons of buildup, as you referred to it, coming into this quarter, and we'll run that off. So we will take our inventories back to our target level, which is a little over 4 weeks -- Jim, 4 or 3, something like that?", "James B. Porter", "That's correct.", "James A. Rubright", "We'll run our system at something like a low point of 4.3 or 4.4. It's a little higher than historic norms, but we've really done a lot of work optimizing roll stock supply into our box plants, and that's where we think we hit an optimum operating level.", "Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC", "And when -- by what month would you expect that 150,000 to be worked down, would it be June, September...?", "James A. Rubright", "We're going to run it down through June.", "Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC", "Through June. Great. Okay, that's good. Second question. There's a lot of consolidation going and rationalization going on in the containerboard industry. Talk about customer turnover in terms of the number of supplies your customers want. Have you been in -- have you lost customers? Have you been able to retain them? Just give us some color on that.", "James A. Rubright", "Well, I think that our -- over the last 12 months, the customer churn or attrition in our system is higher than we would like, and a lot of that is associated with the disruption associated with the very significant structural changes Smurfit had instituted in the periods prior to the acquisition. And that has a lingering effect, and it's currently a matter of major focus for us. Certainly, consolidation provides opportunities. Many customers will seek more than one supplier, so that put some churn in the marketplace, and whenever everybody is materially changing their operations, that can also result in some customer dissatisfaction and churn. So we think there's a lot of movement in the marketplace right now, but at RockTenn, we have a lot of improvement we can achieve by improving our customer experience.", "Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay, great. And then the final question. You talk about the competitive box market. Would it be fair to say that the greatest competition is in the Northeast? And if that's correct, what would you attribute that to?", "James A. Rubright", "I don't know that I can say where the competition is the greatest. We're certainly facing intense competition in the Northeast because there are a number of strong competitors there, including a number of quite strong independents, and it's less of a seasonal agricultural market, say for example, in the West. I didn't go into this point, but we've done a lot of work on sort of what our box plant system ought to work, the kinds of people we should have and what detailed sort of execution plans we should have. And I would say we're farthest advanced there by far in the West, and that's the region that's most successful. So do I conclude that it's the people achieving the success in the model for the rest of the system or is it less competitive? I think it's really the former, and that template is what we're basically bringing through across our box plant. It'd be nice if we could it all at once, but we haven't been able to do that. But I would attribute it more to the success of people than I would to the relative competitiveness of the market or certainly, the assets we've got in the market.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Stephen Atkinson.", "Stephen Atkinson - BMO Capital Markets Canada", "In terms of the $550 million, as you say, profit improvement program, can you tell me where you are right now, the run rate?", "James A. Rubright", "Yes, Steve indicated that we're comfortable that we've achieved $150 million. We believe we're somewhat in excess of that, but that's a range of where we are right now.", "Stephen Atkinson - BMO Capital Markets Canada", "Okay. And so that in terms of timing, then really just looking at trying to complete it by 2014 rather than '13.", "James A. Rubright", "I think the middle of 2014 is what we said, and that that's 24 months from today, and I think we -- a reasonable expectation, yes.", "Stephen Atkinson - BMO Capital Markets Canada", "Okay, I understand that. Sorry, I missed as on the call I can hear it. So when we're looking at the capacity additions and now you recognize and respect that you're on the firm according to demand, are any of the capacity additions or benefit or increased sales included in the $550 million?", "James A. Rubright", "Yes.", "Stephen Atkinson - BMO Capital Markets Canada", "Oh, okay. So that would assume a certain increase in the ability to sell?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, I'm not sure I answered your question as well as I could have. What we have always said is that the -- certainly with respect to the Hodge and Hopewell projects, the savings that we're forecasting and therefore, the economics that we built in or simply cost structure savings at those mills, we're taking that much cost out of the finished product. With respect to the balance of the capacity, we're not making -- we have an open-ended assumption, and that is if the market is there for us to sell that at compensatory rates, we will do so. And if the market is not there, we won't. How we then restructure our system will depend upon where the market is at the time.", "Stephen Atkinson - BMO Capital Markets Canada", "Sure. So the premise is that if there was export demand, then obviously, you could run at a higher rate. That's really where I was headed.", "James A. Rubright", "Yes, exactly.", "Stephen Atkinson - BMO Capital Markets Canada", "And what are your percent of exports right now? Are you able to tell me that?", "James A. Rubright", "Yes, we increased our exports in the quarter over the prior -- in the early preceding quarter, and I think we were at around 14% of our total containerboard capacity we export.", "Stephen Atkinson - BMO Capital Markets Canada", "Okay. And finally, what is the degree of box plant integration or integration with your box plants?", "James A. Rubright", "It's about 70%.", "Stephen Atkinson - BMO Capital Markets Canada", "Okay. And you're -- well, obviously, you have the facility to increase that if you want to. It's really just growth in customers. Am I reading that right?", "James A. Rubright", "Yes, we have capacity in our box plant system, and its success in the marketplace that will increase that degree of integration. We also would consider acquisitions that would further that integration if the acquisitions bring us good assets and a good -- stable customer base.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "In containerboard, you referenced bottoming export markets in the quarter and some improvement heading into 3Q. And just following up on Mark's question and understanding you can't comment on specific pricing actions, can you just remind us what the sort of typical lag you see between price negotiation and realization historically, what that historically is in the export markets?", "James A. Rubright", "It's relatively rapid regarding what to get because the export pricing is ultimately either spot or 1 month or 2 months out, so it's relatively immediate. But that doesn't mean just because you announced a pricing increase you'd actually immediately get X. You may, over a period of months, be in the process of executing that increase. But it's not a situation where you have long-term contracts that significantly impact your ability to recover what the market will allow.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the box board side, we've been hearing about offshore capacity that's coming online or expected to come online next year. Have you seen or do you anticipate any pressure of domestic competitors kind of diverting tonnage from the export market to the domestic market? Kind of realizing that you guys don't really export SBS, but have you seen that dynamic in the domestic market at all?", "James A. Rubright", "No, we haven't. I'm not sure what drives the domestic market anyway, but as I've indicated, the markets have been relatively weaker than they were 1.5 to 2 years ago, but our demand has been relatively stable because we are so focused on the folding carton markets, which as I've indicated, have been relatively stable.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then maybe just final question. Have you seen CUK kind of gain any market share from CRB or SBS in your business? Is that dynamic sort of impacted you at all?", "James A. Rubright", "There was a long-term trend where that was the case, that they sort of got to the markets that was a natural fit for CUK. And I'd say for a fairly long period of time, there's been a balance of movement in and out, but I don't think it's been material.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mr. Staphos.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "One quick one, and I'll fill [ph] in the call. Could you comment on what you think your current liner versus medium mixes in your capacity, are you happy with it, and do you -- when we're done with these products, how would you see that balance shifting between liner and medium? Related question, it seems like as a region, North America is tightest in medium yet you're starting to see more medium mill closures versus linerboard. Just wondering why you thought that was the case, perhaps, our export strength longer term.", "James A. Rubright", "Our system is medium long, if you just simply looked at our overall balance, and the projects that we're doing at Hodge and Hopewell increased our craft liner capacity. But at the end of that, we still end up medium low. I think we're in better balance, but not perfect.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "James A. Rubright", "All right.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Jason Thompson, Director of Investment Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jason Thompson", "Thanks, Kimsom, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced our results before the market opened. The notification of this morning's call was broadly disclosed. Further, this morning's call is being webcast at mwv.com and slides that accompanying this call are available there as well. I'll briefly remind you that certain statements we make are forward-looking and are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties described in our public filings. Furthermore, contents contain time-sensitive information that although correct today may change with the passage of time.", "All the results we share this morning are presented on a continuing operations basis. For the third quarter, the company's income from continuing operations was $67 million or $0.38 per share. Excluding special items, adjusted net income from continuing operations was $69 million or $0.39 per share.", "Now here to tell you more about our results for the third quarter are John Luke, Chairman and CEO; Jim Buzzard, our President; and Mark Rajkowski, CFO.", "I'll now turn the call over to John.", "John A. Luke", "Jason, thanks very much, and good morning. MWV's results during the third quarter shows that we're continuing to execute our strategy and performing well through a period of sustained economic uncertainty. Overall, our revenue was about the same as last year. The result was negatively impacted by foreign exchange. Our volume grew by more than 3%, and pricing and product mix were modestly positive. In most cases, our targeted markets have remained relatively firm, and we're gaining shares through our profitable growth strategies. While earnings were lower mainly due to foreign exchange and lower land sales, we have continued to execute on productivity and operational excellence initiatives that led to another quarter of solid profitability.", "I'll expand on these high-level performance indicators with additional commentary about progress on our profitable growth strategies and what we're seeing in our markets before turning to Jim and Mark for a detailed report on our segments including our continuing momentum in Specialty Chemicals and progress with our Brazilian expansion and financial results in the quarter, then we'll get to your questions.", "While slower growth around the world is having an impact on overall demand, our profitable growth strategies have enabled us to outperform on a relative basis by building our positions in targeted end markets and geographies despite these economic pressures. As we've noted, our work is focused on 4 key areas: Commercial excellence, innovation, emerging markets and expanded participation. We've made significant progress through 2012, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver billion dollars in profitable revenue growth over the next 3 to 5 years.", "In commercial excellence, we continue to see good results from our ongoing partnership with Anheuser-Busch InBev, especially as they succeed with NFL promotional packaging for Bud Light. The unique look and feel of these packages is the direct result of our highly coordinated commercial strategy including the packaging brand engagement sessions we conducted with them and highlighted at our Investor meeting for you last year.", "In innovation, we recently launched a new line of fragrance pumps based on our consumer insight work in the beauty and personal care market. These new products in our Melodie line of sprayers will help customers distinguish their luxury brands and drive exclusivity with discerning fragrance consumers. We're also seeing good order patterns for Shellpak Renew and successful trials for Captivate, our shopper-ready packaging solution for Food & Beverage markets.", "In emerging markets, we just announced late last week the acquisition of Ruby Macons in India, which will significantly strengthen our profitable growth in this targeted emerging market where modern retail is just taking route and the middle class is expanding rapidly. Ruby Macons is the leader in corrugated packaging materials and has grown on average over 20% during the last several years. We'll leverage our experience with the industrial packaging business in Brazil to further accelerate growth and returns. And speaking of MWV Rigesa, the team has done an outstanding job executing on our expansion project in Brazil, and we expect significant earnings in cash benefits beginning in 2013.", "In expanded participation, we're continuing to identify our customers' biggest needs and challenges and respond with the right materials, technologies and solutions. That process is ongoing and important to our profitable growth ambitions. Our recent expansion into caps and closures, for instance, led to significant new business with a major household products company, which has helped drive double-digit volume growth in this business.", "Through these strategies, we're creating growth opportunities in our targeted markets, markets which remained attractive despite current economic pressures. In fact, we're seeing growth above GDP levels in many of the end markets and geographies where we have leadership positions, and we're generating profitable growth that is stronger than the market. For instance, we continue to succeed in the corrugated market in Brazil where we again outperformed the overall market during the quarter. We're also winning with adherence packaging in health care. Dispensers for skincare applications in Asia, preservative-free medical pumps in Europe and beverage multipacks in North America and emerging markets. Given these and other examples of our strong positions, we fully expect to build on of this momentum. We're leaning forward during this difficult period, and we're pleased with the progress that we have made. But we know that circumstances could become even more challenging in the coming months and perhaps beyond, given uncertainties surrounding the fiscal cliff in United States, continuing financial economic difficulties in Europe and other potential threats to global growth. We'll stay focused on executing the strategy that has worked for us so far and capturing the growth that is available in our targeted markets and geographies.", "I'll now turn to Jim for some additional detail about our performance in each segment for the quarter, Jim?", "James A. Buzzard", "Thank you, John. We executed well, both commercially and operationally during the third quarter in what remains a very tough global economic environment. Our profitable growth strategies and productivity initiatives across the businesses continue to positively impact earnings. This largely offset lower land sales in CDLM and negative foreign exchange associated with our sales in Europe and Brazil.", "I'll provide some detail about performance in each of our segments starting with packaging. In our Food & Beverage segment, sales and earnings were down slightly during the third quarter and would have been substantially improved except for the negative impact in foreign exchange. Our retail food, tobacco and beverage packaging businesses were stronger in North America and Asia, where we gain share through our commercial excellence efforts and growth initiatives in emerging markets. Pricing also remained stable, and we maintained our positive price cost spread by delivering measurable value to our customers. We also had solid productivity gains at the mills and facilities that support this segment. Lower volumes in Europe and the effect of the weaker Euro had a negative impact in overall earnings in the Food & Beverage segment.", "Looking at the end markets we serve in this segment, in beverage, the overall market trends this year have been flat in North America, weak in Europe, as you might expect and positive in Asia and Latin America. In many cases, the growth in the beverage market is coming from categories where multipacks do not currently participate, such as energy drinks, tea and bottled water. In North America, our volume was positive in the quarter as we added business with Dr Pepper Snapple. In Asia, our business continues to grow as we place beverage packaging machines with new customers and in new geographies including the emerging markets and then capture the benefits in terms of additional carton volumes. In the third quarter, for instance, we placed our first machine in Thailand and our first innovative machine for the food market in Korea. And we gained carton volume during the period as a result of previously placed machines in China, Australia and Japan.", "In food, the market has been experiencing huge volume declines as higher food prices have hit cost-sensitive consumers around the world. Our volume outpaced these broader trends during the third quarter largely due to our innovative products such as Mware paperboard for hot coffee cups and commercial excellence with top brand owners who recognize our value proposition and specify our packaging materials product categories such as Frozen Foods.", "We also continue to work on our innovation pipeline with tests and trials that will captivate our shopper ready solution that is being used by Nestl\u00e9 Purina in Kroger stores and Evertain, our paperboard solution for salty snacks and other products that will begin shelf life testing during the fourth quarter.", "Overall, our outlook for Food & Beverage markets remains positive. We expect segment profits in the fourth quarter to be solidly above year-ago levels. We are cautiously optimistic that stable demand trend will result in modest volume growth versus the prior year. In addition, we will benefit from lower mill outage costs, moderate input cost inflation and improved pricing and mix. We will, however, have a maintenance outage at Evadale and continue negative impact from foreign currency exchange.", "In the Home, Health & Beauty segment, sales were down slightly in the quarter as some of our pricing for plastic packaging reset as part of contracts linked to the cost of plastic resin. Though as you can see in our slide presentation, the overall price cost spread was still favorable.", "We had volume increases in personal care and healthcare dispensers, as well as sales growth to adherence packaging. The caps and closures business we acquired at the end of the fourth quarter last year also added to sales and we saw good growth in that business. Even with the overall sales decline, primarily from the negative impact of foreign exchange, earnings increased in the segment 20% to $12 million.", "In health care, our innovative new solution, Shellpak Renew, is driving higher demand for adherence packaging. A market that is growing due to the reduced costs and improved health outcomes associated with increased patient adherence. We have also begun to introduce adherence packaging as a solution in emerging markets. We had our first revenue in India during the third quarter, and our customer won an India Star Award for excellence in packaging as a result of this launch. Also in the third quarter, we saw strong volume growth for a primary medical plastic solutions, and we expect continued growth in our Healthcare business through our ongoing innovation and global commercial efforts.", "In Home and Garden, the business continues to be impacted by the slightly negative trends in North America and Europe, though we're gaining in Europe with the recent expansion of the innovative trigger sprayer we acquired from Spray Plast. And we're also bringing new solution to the North American market that leveraged this platform including a launch for SC Johnson's Windex brand.", "Most of the business we added from our expanded participation in caps and closures is in the Home and Garden market, and those volumes continue to increase strongly with major branded customers. Including the new win John mentioned for a differentiated cap for Clorox's new bathroom cleanser.", "Looking at personal-care, our business is roughly in line with, or in some cases slightly better than, a market that continues to be pressured by lower consumer spending especially in Europe. We're doing well with our plastic dispensers for skincare and fragrances in markets around the world, and our cap and closure business also continues to grow.", "In the fourth quarter, we expect earnings in the Home, Health & Beauty segment to increase modestly versus the comparable year ago quarter. Volume growth in plastics dispensing solutions in targeted markets will be partially offset by continued declines in folding carton volumes due to weakness in Europe. The segment's price cost spread is expected to be neutral, while productivity gains and continued contribution from the caps and closure business will drive the expected improvement.", "In our industrial segment, sales and earnings were down as we expected during the third quarter with much of the decline due to the continued depreciation of the dollar versus the Brazilian real compared to last year and start-up costs related to our expansion project. The corrugated packaging market in Brazil was up slightly in the third quarter, and we grew in the end markets for produce, meats and consumer products. Our strong performance in the market continues to support our excitement about the investment in Brazil. We started up the new paperboard machine in the quarter and will continue to proceed through the start-up curve through the end of this year, leading to positive incremental earnings and cash flow contributions in 2013.", "In the fourth quarter, we expect earnings in the Industrial segment to be similar to third quarter levels and driven by many of the same factors, chiefly unfavorable foreign exchange translations, onetime in nature expenses from the ramp-up of the new machine, and start-up costs associated with the rebuild of the existing Tr\u00eas Barras machine.", "In the Specialty Chemicals segment, sales and earnings grew double digits again in the third quarter even as we compare against the very strong performance last year. We continue to make strong volume gains in our highest value solutions for the carbon, asphalt paving, oilfield and adhesive markets. Productivity was impacted by growth investments we are making to penetrate targeted value-added carbon and pine chemicals markets and by certain onetime costs.", "In the fourth quarter, we expect to continue our improved year-over-year earnings trajectory in the Specialty Chemicals segment. While a strong margin profile will remain relatively consistent. The absolute profit increase will be more modest as we continue to cycle earlier strong gains. Also impacting the fourth quarter will be routine maintenance downtime in each of our carbon plants and pine chemicals refineries.", "In Community Development and Land Management, development activities continue to move along at a good pace, and we had a total of 12 small track sales during the quarter. Overall, we are seeing more interest in our well-located lands, as sentiment in the housing and real estate market improves. We have a number of projects in our pipeline for the Charleston region including a master plan community in Summerville, South Carolina, called Nexton and industrial properties that will support the business growth from Boeing and the Charleston Port, among others. Based on the current pipeline of land sales expected to close during the fourth quarter, we anticipate earnings in this segment to be higher than last year.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark. Mark?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Thanks, Jim. We had another solid overall financial performance during the quarter, especially considering the challenging global economic environment. We're executing well in our profitable growth strategy and our productivity programs. The result was solid volume growth and good margin performance demonstrating that our overall business model is strong and that our strategy is working.", "As we look beyond the current year, the progress and the foundation for growth that we're building today continues to give us good confidence in achieving our goal of $1 billion in profitable revenue growth over the next 3 to 5 years. I'll quickly hit the highlights of the quarter and then provide additional detail about our outlook for the fourth quarter.", "There are 2 highlights during the quarter that stand out as reflecting the underlying strength of our business. First, the combination of volume growth in price and mix improvement drove a 3% revenue increase on a constant currency basis, and our adjusted operating income of $143 million with over 10% operating margins. This was good performance considering the significant foreign exchange headwinds we faced in the lower level of high margin land sales versus last year.", "Taking a closer look at the income statement and starting with sales, we had another solid quarter. We generated volume growth across all manufacturing segments by using our strategy to capitalize on the growth opportunities despite the difficult global economy. This was particularly evident in our packaging businesses where we continue to drive above-market growth in many of our targeted markets.", "Our food, beverage and tobacco packaging businesses each outperformed their respective underlying industry growth rates with particularly strong volume growth for retail food packaging materials and solutions for food service applications.", "In Home, Health and Beauty, we're beginning to see the benefits from the investments we've been making in several of our growth platforms. Some examples include double-digit growth for skincare and hair care dispensing products, strong growth for medical pumps and dispensing products in health care and continued progress with our adherence packaging solutions including Shellpak Renew.", "Finally, in industrial packaging, while sales were lower due to currency exchange, volumes continue to grow with key food, industrial and personal care customers. Despite the challenging demand environment, we had a modestly positive price mix contribution, which is a direct result of our more-focused, higher value product set and market discipline. As expected, the level of year-over-year price increases has narrowed as we fully cycle the larger paperboard increases we negotiated over the last 2 years. We are, however, continuing to price for value across all of our businesses and improve our product mix.", "Adjusted SG&A was essentially flat year-over-year with increases for the acquisition of Polytop and growth investments in our Specialty Chemicals business, partially offset by cost reductions and currency. Our solid revenue performance combined with continued productivity gains in our manufacturing and supply chain operations enable us to deliver adjusted operating margins of 10.3% during the quarter.", "Year-over-year, adjusted operating profit and margins were negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange and start-up expenses for the new paper machine in Brazil. On an aggregate basis, these items reduced year-over-year operating profit by $27 million or almost 200 basis points. The takeaway is that our underlying business model remains strong, and we're delivering on the things that we can control.", "Before turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, let me quickly touch on the discontinued operations line. The $16 million after-tax charge primarily represents non-cash tax and other final adjustments related to the spin merge of the Consumer & Office Products business in the second quarter. This line will go away beginning next quarter as we don't expect any further adjustments.", "Turning to the balance sheet. Our financial position and liquidity remains strong. This was recently recognized by Moody's in their decision to upgrade MWV's credit-rating to investment-grade. At September 30, we had cash and cash equivalents of $745 million. We'll use these funds to complete our large capital projects, invest in our profitable growth initiatives including our recently announced acquisition of Ruby Macons, which we expect to close in the current quarter, as well as continue to deliver strong cash returns to our shareholders.", "Cash flow from operations in the quarter was approximately $120 million versus $220 million in the year ago period. The year-over-year change primarily reflects higher working capital. Most of the working capital increase relates to timing of payments for accounts payable and accruals with the remainder driven by higher receivables due to unit sales growth. We expect most of the timing items to reverse and to see strong cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter.", "In terms of our outlook, there are no near-term catalyst for growth and the global economic environment remains challenging. We expect to see continued uneven demand and order trends as our customers tightly manage their supply chains through the end of the year.", "That said, we expect fourth quarter earnings to be significantly above the prior year on a continuing operations basis. In addition to benefits from our profitable growth strategy and continued productivity gains, our meal outage costs will be substantially below last year's level. Continued unfavorable foreign exchange translation, as well as start-up expenses related to the commissioning of the new machine in Brazil will continue to be the primary negative offsets to earnings. John?", "John A. Luke", "Mark, thanks very much. To summarize, there are number of positive signs in our third quarter results, namely, that our profitable growth strategy is working and the markets we've targeted have remained relatively firm. We're gratified by our performance. However, as Mark just emphasized, we are mindful that we're operating in a still very challenging economic environment and that further uncertainty lies ahead. We'll stay very focused on executing the elements of our strategy that have worked for us so far, working to build momentum on the build on the momentum we've generated in our target markets and geographies.", "This concludes our prepared remarks this morning, and we'd now be happy to address whatever questions that you have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We now go to the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just a question, John, about last -- this announcement around Ruby Macons last week. For years, it seemed like the company was moving away from mill-centered businesses into more kind of packaging and converting businesses, things like the pumps and dispensers businesses and other things. I just -- it seems like with this acquisition and also the expansion of the mill down in Brazil that maybe the pendulum is swinging back the other way from a corporate strategy standpoint, can you address that?", "John A. Luke", "We'd be happy to, Mark. And it's a good fair question. I think one of the things we've really worked very hard to emphasize is we have targeted the end markets we have is that our strategy is to pursue and drive economically profitable growth and with -- through solutions in those targeted markets. And doing so in ways that really leverage our knowledge and our capabilities, both in the marketplace and from a technology standpoint. To your point, the expansion -- the investment in the expansion of paperboard in Brazil and this most recent investment in containerboard in India are very good examples of that, but we're also very keen on continuing to move downstream closer to the market, as well with solutions, just as Jim described and reinforced with Polytop and Spray Plast. So it's going to be a both end, all driven by the pursuit of good strong solutions-driven positions in markets where we can generate economically -- sustainable economic profitability.", "Operator", "We now go to the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "On the Specialty Chemicals business, I'm not sure if you mentioned this, but were -- what was the volume growth during the quarter? And if you can kind of parse that out by the various subsegments, pine chemicals, carbon filters, et cetera, that would be helpful.", "John A. Luke", "Jim , do you want...", "James A. Buzzard", "Sure. I'll take that. We saw growth across all of the elements of that business in double-digit range. Clearly, we have seen gains in automobiles in China, the North America automobile business so that's driving our carbon business up nicely. And then, as I reported, I think certainly oil fields, asphalt and adhesives, key target markets for us all showing good growth all around the world.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "But it averaged double digit is up across the board?", "James A. Buzzard", "Yes.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. All right. And then the lower pricing on standard products that you referred to for the segment, can you expand on this?", "James A. Buzzard", "Sure. We play across a broad portfolio of both end markets and products, some of them are more standardized products. And as we have seen declines in competing raw materials like gum raws and certain of those product categories have come under a little bit of pressure, but if you look at the broad base of the portfolio and where emphasis is, the price mix continues to be very good for us.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And just maybe one last question for Mark. Mark, how should we think about adjusted EPS number for 4Q of 2011, just to make sure that we're all in the same page here.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, Ghansham, frankly, I don't have that one off the top of my head. Jason, do you -- what is it?", "Jason Thompson", "I mean, you guys have the 7 profitability for CNOP, income tax offset that and come up with a relatively close adjusted number.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. That $0.05, is that what I heard?", "Jason Thompson", "Yes.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "In the neighborhood, yes.", "Operator", "We now go to the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I have 2 questions. First of all, maybe for Jim. Jim, are you happy with where backlogs are, given the market dynamic? And is any of the Evadale outage -- I think you mentioned it was maintenance, but is any of that related to market management, if you will?", "James A. Buzzard", "Sure, George. I guess I'm never satisfied with where are backlogs are, but they're holding steady at 2 to 3 weeks. They vary across the machine base. And given the market dynamics, we think we're performing well in our targeted segments. In terms of Evadale, this is a normal maintenance outage. Roughly, it's going to cost probably in the $10 million to $12 million range and -- but it's tied to a recovery boiler and will take some machine downtime with it, again, all maintenance. Having said that, as we have historically, we'll closely monitor the demand situation, and we'll adjust our production to meet the demand.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And my follow-on would be, overall, you mentioned that maintenance will be down year-on-year, if I remember that correctly. Could you quantify what the fourth quarter year-on-year decline in maintenance will look like? And overall, what should we think about in terms of Rigesa profitability for next year if you have a bogey for that?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Well just -- George, this is Mark. I mean, just on the North American Mills, it's probably year-over-year close to $40 million and in Rigesa, we're looking at somewhere around $8 million to $10 million of costs to continue to commission #4 machine as well as restart #3.", "Operator", "We now go to the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just on Specialty Chemicals, the $8 million there of headwind on productivity, you mentioned the investments and carbon and pine chemicals, as well as some onetime items, I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on that in terms of the investments you're making and what some of those onetime expenses were and how we should be thinking about this moving forward?", "James A. Buzzard", "Sure, Phil. This is Jim. In terms of the investments, we continue to invest in talent and capability out ahead of some of the growth as we have, so we prepared for it. In the third quarter, we did open our first office and lab in India, and so we see great opportunity for the pine chemicals business over there. And as we've shown strong growth in places like China, Europe, North America continue to add on the margin the right kind of talent that we need to drive that growth and innovate with new products. In terms of some of the onetime costs, they were the host of things, we had a -- there's legal settlement, there's a bad debt expense, but just a range of onetime thing, none of them very extensive.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then on Home, Health & Beauty, you continue to make progress on the margins there. Just 2 items, 2 of the moving pieces you've talked about in prior quarters, one of which is Shellpak, which I believe was breakeven a couple of quarters ago. I was just wondering what kind of progress you've made on the margins there as you continue to ramp the volumes. And then secondarily, around the European folding carton business, it sounds like it continues to struggle. Is there any potential for some restructuring that could happen there?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Phil, it's Mark. We have grown that adherence business quarter sequentially, and we expect continued growth as we move into 2013. Your recollection is right. Last quarter, it was roughly breakeven and margins were positive in the low single-digit as that business continues to grow. And with respect to Europe, as you would expect, with weak demands, we are aggressively assessing that situation, and we'll be taking the right actions to fix that.", "John A. Luke", "Yes, and so -- it's John. I would just reinforce everything that Mark has said on that, and I would elaborate just for a moment on the Shellpak question and the adherence business. I think we are more excited than ever by the progress that we see being made there. The potential for volume growth, attractive volume growth, driven by the increasing penetration not only in the retail sector but increasingly, the large Pharma company sector is such that we're very, very encouraged, and we look forward over the next several quarters to reporting examples of good progress.", "Operator", "We now go to the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Maybe just sticking on Europe and maybe just globally for a moment. Can you just remind us at some point we should start to comp some of the weakness that I think you started to see in the fourth quarter last year? And I'm just wondering, are you seeing kind of incremental sequential weakness as you've moved through 2012? And also just talk maybe about kind of what trends you saw in North America and Asia specifically as you move through the third quarter?", "James A. Buzzard", "Sure, Gail. Its Jim. I'll take a crack at that and look to John and Mark maybe to add some more comments. We play in a lot of end markets in each of these regions, so you can imagine some are up down or down. At a high level, I wouldn't say that things deteriorated in the third quarter. Certainly in some of our businesses, the plastics, the beauty and personal care, we actually saw gains year-over-year. Having said that, as we referenced in all of our comments, it's a difficult environment out there. And so we continue to monitor and watch it, but no real trends that evolved through the third quarter that would say things were any weaker.", "John A. Luke", "Yes, and I would agree with that, Jim. And it has really been uneven. And we would expect that, that type of demand pattern to continue as our customers are managing their supply chains. We are also seeing some growth in emerging markets on a currency-neutral basis. We were up mid-single digits in terms of revenue growth in emerging markets. So I think Jim summed it up well. You really have to break it down by end market in each of the geographies, but no we don't see any significant change in the underlying demand pattern. No, and I would just comment, Gail, that what we're seeing around the world is clearly reflective of the contraction that we've seen in most markets. The only exception right now is Brazil, which seems to be modestly on the rebound. And we hope on a sustainable basis from the depths earlier this year. But as I commented and Mark and Jim commented as well, the markets that we have targeted with the product solutions we're bringing for the most part have seen relatively stable to modestly improving opportunities as we go forward. And we would want to go on record and saying in an uncertain world that, that's performance that\u2019s predictive of the future, but it does reinforce to us that the targeted market, targeted geography approach that we're bringing to our strategy is one that is sound, gives us greater confidence, we're making greater progress, and we will stay the course.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And just a quick follow-up on Mark Wilde's question on Brazil. In addition to kind of moving into mills, you're moving into recycled where you've been a virgin-based producer, does that impact how you think that business might develop compared to what Rigesa has been able to do in terms of Food & Beverage in terms of food and produce?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "I assume you're talking about India, Gail, and let me comment a little bit broadly on India and get to your question as well. As we've talked in this forum and others, India is a very targeted -- key targeted part of our emerging market strategy, is one we studied closely. We've learned a lot from our early almost pilot-type experience with the investment we made, the corrugated facility -- corrugated company, Wadco. Some years back, we've had growing experience in both the consumer and health care markets as well. It's a market that is growing very nicely despite the relatively recent contraction from the peak a few years ago. We see a growing middle-class, modernizing supply chains, liberalization for investment in retail and overall surging demand for consumer and industrial goods. The investment that we've made is in a leading producer of corrugated packaging materials. Recycled, as you know, is based in the very business-friendly State of Gujarat. You've seen the particulars on the transaction. It's one that we see significant opportunity to leverage the know-how, the knowledge in the market solutions that we've developed in Brazil, and it's very timely because the Indian containerboard and corrugated market is not only growing at a double-digit rate. It's going through a huge transformation from a really old almost in some cases basic manual set of technology to one that is increasingly modernized. And Ruby Macons, producer of recycled materials is hands down based on our assessment, the leading quality producer in that marketplace. I know there have been a couple of questions beyond specifics about recycled, about the transaction itself, and let me just offer a couple more things because I think it's very, very positive from our standpoint. You can be sure to other comments that we've made that the transaction analysis was very informed by rigorous economic profit assessment. We paid less than $100 million for the transaction at roughly a 9x multiple. We see the opportunity as markets continue to grow to expand the business materially with very modest capital investment. We expected to be a very accretive transaction, only modestly so in 2013 because it's an accounting measure, but the company is a  double-digit operating margin performer. It's generating mid-teens EBIT margins, and we expect a very positive trajectory going forward. We'll learn a lot with the recycled materials but again, leveraging the know-how we have in Brazil, coupled with the outstanding quality that Ruby Macons leadership has brought to the floor gives us great encouragement about the opportunities in that country.", "Operator", "We now go to the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.", "Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "John, 2 questions. Can we go back to Rigesa and talk about what to expect in terms of the progression. Your comments talk a lot about headwinds but not much about prices. Is price where it needs to be, and how should we think about earnings facing in during the year relative to ramp-up costs, et cetera? And then the second question, you deliberately slowed your land sale process. Is it reasonable to think that you're probably looking to accelerate that again now?", "John A. Luke", "Let me offer just a couple of comments, and I'll turn it to Mark, Mark. We -- in Brazil, which I think your first part of your question was looking towards, we see an opportunity as we go forward, particularly as markets are firming to improve our pricing profile. And what we've first got to be sure is that market demand is back where it is as we commented on performance relative to the general market from a volume standpoint has thus far been attractive. Mark can talk about the trajectory we see as we move through 2013 in just a moment. On land sales, we have seen that slowed both in terms of reflecting demand, as well as select pricing over time. And clearly, if we do see the opportunity for increasing select land sales at attractive prices as we move through the next several months, we'll be judicious and take full advantage of those. Mark?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, John, I want to emphasize that point on pricing. It is important that it continues to be a pretty highly inflationary environment down in Brazil, particularly related to wages. So getting our pricing and product mix improved there is going to be very important. And on the ramp of the new machine for next year, we will provide more detail as we get through the commissioning on our next call. However, I think it's fair to say that the ramp will be more back-end loaded but will certainly start to see some benefits as early as the second quarter.", "Operator", "We now go to the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Just want to follow up a little bit more on Brazil. So does that mean that in the first quarter we're going to continue to see some cost, or does that go away and then we start seeing the ramp of the benefit coming in?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, I think we've got a lot of work to do relative to the lightweighting as well. We've got -- that's an important part of our cost benefit, the productivity that we've talked about, and we'll be doing a lot of that work into the first quarter. So it really -- as we see those benefits come on, we'd expect to see substantial improvement in the back half. And the first quarter of this year was pretty good, if you look at that quarter's sequential performance. The first quarter performance this year was pretty solid.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "You mean the first quarter of 2012?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "2012, yes. So part of it is a little tougher compare. We're still getting the machine up or getting our lightweighting technology in place. And then you'll really see the benefit of all of that starting to hit in Q2 and really ramping up in the second half.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "And I guess -- just trying to get a grasp of the potential magnitude. If I look back at the industrial businesses, operating earnings in 2010, 2011. There's $80 million to $85 million each year. Obviously, it's at a much lower run rate in the third quarter. And then you've spent a lot of money to improve the positioning, I think you talked at one point, and correct me if I'm wrong, of potentially as much as $100 million of incremental profitability that could come from Brazil. Is that still within the realm of attainable, do you think as everything gets put in place that you could be back to the $80 million run rate with a very sizable addition, $100 million type addition on top of it? Or have there been significant changes that have taken place that one really has to reset the bar?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, Mark, listen, everything that went into our business case and the value drivers of that investment are still fully in place. We've got great confidence around our ability to deliver on that. Remember, I mean, we've seen on over 20% deval in the Real. So on a U.S. dollar basis, that's brought the earnings base down. But assuming the currency just stays level with today, we expect to drive significant improvements in EBIT and cash flow. And as I said just a moment ago, we'll give you a little bit better sense as to what that might be in 2013 on the next call.", "Operator", "We now go to the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "On the bleach board side, you reported a nice pick up in volumes year-over-year, can you just talk about what drove that? And then also I would have thought that you would have seen a more meaningful pickup in profitability from operating leverage that didn\u2019t really materialize. Can you also just talk about the -- why there wasn\u2019t more operating leverage from the volume improvement?", "John A. Luke", "Jim, do you want to...", "James A. Buzzard", "Sure. I'll be glad to. We did see some nice pickup in the food, food service, beverage and tobacco markets in various regions. Part of that is related to the markets where we play, the value proposition that we bring to those markets, and I think that's helped drive the volume growth.", "John A. Luke", "Yes, I'd add to that, that we actually did see good leverage. I mean what really impacted our earnings in the quarter was FX. I mean, that was almost a $10 million impact. Without that, we're up almost 10%. So the underlying fundamentals are exactly as Jim described. I mean, we saw volumes. We saw improvement in price and mix and really solid productivity.", "Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Mark, and can you just remind us what the geographic breakdown for that food and beverage business is?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "No, I can't right now.", "John A. Luke", "Well, Jason will get back to you on that.", "Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, I will follow up. And just a couple of more questions. On Covington, can you just give us an update there on how that boiler project is coming along and when we should expect to see the benefit flow through the P&L there?", "James A. Buzzard", "Sure. The program is going along very well. We remain on schedule and under budget and expect to -- we will finish that way. And we would see the full benefit in the fourth quarter of next year.", "Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, got it. And just last question Ruby Macons investments. I was reading somewhere that there's potential to increase capacity on an existing machine or perhaps even build a new machine. Can you just talk about whether or not that opportunity exists, what the incremental capacity add potentially is and what grade of paper that would be in?", "John A. Luke", "Yes. It's John. Let me just comment, and I'll ask Jim to supplement my comments. It would be all of the above. We see significant opportunity there to bring -- enhance productivity to existing equipment, as well as the real estate and the opportunity to expand production. As I mentioned, we've got a marketplace where Ruby Macons is the hands-down leader in quality and performance in this segment of the market and a market that is growing double digits. So any acquisition of this sort has to contemplate the opportunity and the cost of investment. And what really brings it both nicely together for us is both the attractiveness of the growth and the capital model that Ruby Macons has employed that I'll ask Jim to comment on. It makes the investment -- the consideration of investment and growth very, very attractive.", "James A. Buzzard", "Yes, and maybe just building for a second on what John has said. The -- and it's early in the process obviously, but we are very excited about the opportunities to grow the business. It's been growing I think as I referenced 20% a year. And with the investments we see from our large customers, the demands on higher-quality product to run across their high-speed filling lines are only going to grow. So as the -- already is the quality leader the capabilities we can bring to drive further quality, we remain excited about the opportunities. Looking at the asset base, a lot of opportunity around modest machine rebuilds to drive growth. And we see an opportunity to perhaps double the output of Ruby Macons over the next 4 or 5 years at a very modest investment base.", "Operator", "We will now go to the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "First question on the -- as you look at your machine placements, you're obviously making good progress there. We've noticed that at least one of the -- probably the fastest beverage can grower out there has canceled 4 plants. I think 1 in Brazil, 3 in China at least indefinitely, and I didn't know if that is affecting how you, all of you, the growth in your -- in the marked product?", "James A. Buzzard", "Clearly, we -- there are different dynamics around the world. In terms of the question on machinery, as I said, you would put a number of placements, Asia really has been a high-growth area for us and moving into non-beverage applications like food, as I referenced, with an investment in Korea. So we continue to have a strong backlog of opportunities to place new machines out there, and that drives the carton growth. So and the markets have been a little bit difficult in Europe clearly, and we've seen some pressure in the carbonated soft drinks  in North America but still feel very good about the business and our positioned in it for growth.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Got you. And then just quick follow-up. As you look at the increase in box board of all stripes, capacity in China coming on, what is your strategy of dealing with that? And can you give us a flavor as to, if any, how much of an overlap you think you guys have with some of the board that's coming online over there?", "James A. Buzzard", "Sure. Obviously, Asia particularly China, driving very strong growth over the next 2 or 3 years. We'll put some pressure on the margin. Those gradually don't compete with our SBS from a quality and performance standpoint. Having said that, their applications where there would likely be some crossover. So we will continue to sell the advantages of SBS in the Global Markets, be that performance on filling lines, the aesthetics and all the things that we bring to those markets. So we're going to monitor it. Those are markets to demand. Quick turnaround, food service we've done that for many, many years, and that's the game we'll have to continue to go on.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will now go to the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes, a couple of follow-ons. So for Mark Rajkowski just on margins, in Beauty and Home, I noticed that there's 860 basis points of D&A in the business, just looking at the spread between EBIT and EBITDA. That seems awfully high for that business, can you offer a little color on that?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "That is largely a function of intangible assets and other purchase accounting that we did in connection with the acquisitions of Calmar, as well as there's some Spray Plast in there and a little bit of Polytop as well.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "All right. So would you expect that to go down over time?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Eventually, it will go down. I mean, it is going down. And as the DA goes down, our EBIT will go up.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes, okay. The other margin question I have, Mark, was going back a few years ago. You were talking about, I think, a 10% margin target on SG&A we\u2019re still above that level. Is that still a good level, and what's your time frame for achieving that?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, directionally, we want to be moving in that direction. And I think we talked about this on the last call. We -- even in a difficult environment, we have great confidence in our ability to grow our business. We've made a number of investments, as Jim and John have commented a little bit earlier, a little bit of ahead of the curve in terms of that growth. We are seeing some of the benefits of that growth. And as we continue to grow that top line, that will certainly push our SG&A as a percentage of sales down towards that 10% level.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. Now the last question I had. Going back about 12 or 18 months ago, we were talking about a couple of those joint ventures you had up on some of the Appalachian land for energy-related projects, can you just update us on that?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, Mark, it's -- obviously, with nat gas prices being down a little bit, the whole process has slowed down a little bit. But certainly, Bluescape continues to be committed to that. They've invested in pipeline to transmit the gas. And on the preliminary test wells that have been drilled, the results have been pretty promising in terms of the pressure levels and the flow. So the market right now is a little bit down because of pricing, but we believe that there's certainly a great potential for this to be a very valuable asset for us.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. So is it fair to assume, Mark, that the pipeline is in place but you've just kind of backed off on actually drilling production wells at this point?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "I mean, that slowed down a little bit, right? And this is a function of Bluescape and how they're managing their capital. So but the underlying, we believe that there's good potential for the underlying reserves.", "Operator", "And speakers, there are no more questions in the queue. Please go ahead.", "Jason Thompson", "Thanks, Kimsom. Can you please give the replay information? And thanks, everyone, for joining us and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 12 p.m. Eastern Standard Time today through November 23, 2012.

My name is Gwen.  I will be your conference operator for today.  At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the RockTenn\u2019s Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2012 Earnings conference call.  All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.  After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question and answer session.

These slides can be accessed at www.rocktenn.com under the Investors page.  Ladies and gentlemen, this call is being recorded today, November 2, 2012.  Should anyone need assistance, please press star, zero.", "Your speakers for today\u2019s call are Mr. James Rubright, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Steve Voorhees, Chief Financial Officer.  Mr. Voorhees, you may begin your conference.", "Steven Voorhees", "Thanks, Gwen.  Good morning.  Welcome to RockTenn\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter 2012 earnings conference call.  I\u2019m Steve Voorhees, Chief Financial Officer, and I\u2019m joined this morning by RockTenn\u2019s CEO, Jim Rubright.  ", "During the call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events.  These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discuss.  We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the SEC, including the fiscal year \u201911 Form 10-K and the Form 10-Qs filed for the past three quarters.  ", "During the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures.  We provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix to the slide presentation.  The slide presentation is available on our website. ", "Jim will begin with commentary on the performance of our businesses during the quarter and then I will discuss the status of the integration as well as various items on our financial statements.  After our prepared comments, Jim and I will be available for questions.", "Jim?", "James Rubright", "Thanks, Steve.  Good morning.  Our 46% earnings increase and adjusted earnings in the share in the quarter resulted from strong operating performance across our business units, payments we received to resolve a dispute over the termination of a paperboard sales agreement which contributed $0.16 per share, and a lower effective tax rate in our fourth quarter.  Our credit agreement EBITDA margin of 13.7% was up 200 basis points over the third quarter, and we generated 128 million in free cash flow available for dividends, pension contributions and excess of pension expense, acquisitions and investments, all net of a small debt increase.  ", "We continue to make solid progress on synergies and earnings improvements, achieving a net run rate at quarter-end in excess of 250 million, and the new leaders we put in place across our corrugated and recycled businesses are accelerating improvements in operating performance.  The container board price increase was implemented and published in the PPW Index in September and export pricing is moving back up.  While these increases provided only a small benefit in the fourth quarter, those increases coupled with the box price increases we are implementing now should contribute strongly to earnings as we move through the next year.  We also increased our dividend to $0.90 per share on an annual rate and that reflects our confidence in our growing free cash flow.  ", "Major negatives in the quarter compared to our internal expectations as we set guidance at the outset of the fourth quarter were the continued slow start-up curve at our Hodge Mill which reduced earnings during the quarter by at least $0.15 compared with our expectations, and the fact that the price increase was published in September, not August as we anticipated at the outset of the quarter, also slightly reducing our earnings for the quarter relative to our initial expectations.", "Our team at Hodge, which we significantly strengthened during the quarter, has made very good progress towards realizing the project benefits; but their efforts have begun to produce good results in October, too late to benefit the September quarter.  While the expected results at Hodge will be much better this quarter, we still believe that we will not hit the full project benefits until we complete two follow-up outages over the next six months.  ", "On an adjusted EPS basis, our corrugated segment improvement contributed $0.33 to earnings.  Consumer packaging contributed $0.13 as the contract settlement I mentioned before was partially offset primarily by lower paperboard pricing, and our recycling segment reduced earnings by $0.04 as lower OCC prices compressed margins and we took a lower cost to market charge on our recycle plant inventories.  ", "As I mentioned, our cash flow generation continued to be strong in the quarter.  We contributed 143 million to our pension plans in excess of pension expense in the quarter.  Also included in other in Chart 6 is 17 million that we used to purchase a leased co-generation facility at our Florence, South Carolina mill; and although it\u2019s a relatively small expenditure, the purchase of those assets will be accretive to earnings compared to the prior lease.  We also used 10 million to fund debt issuance costs as we moved to term out some debt with a $700 million note issuance that Steve will discuss.", "In fiscal 2012, we generated approximately 515 million in cash flow or $7.18 per share that we applied to dividends, debt repayment, pension contributions in excess of pension expense, and acquisitions.  This is after 452 million in capital expenditures, the 17 million co-generation plant purchase that I mentioned, 14 million we paid in a redemption premium to retire our 300 million 9.25 2016 notes, and a total of 16 million in new debt issuance costs.  Our capital expenditures of 104 million in the quarter and 452 million for the year are below our beginning of the year guidance of 480 to 500 million for the fiscal year; however, much of the shortfall is a matter of timing with expenditures running over into fiscal 2013, and it simply has the effect of increasing our full-year 2013 expectation for capital expenditures from 400 million to a range of 430 to 450 million, effectively no change in our capital expenditure plans over those two years.", "Now I\u2019ll turn to more detail regarding our segment performance.  Our corrugated shipments were up 1.3% over the June quarter compared with a slight decline for the industry.  Our fourth quarter 2012 corrugated shipments were up 4.3% on an equivalent per-day FBA basis over the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to the industry which was up 0.2%.  Our containerboard production was up almost 176,000 tons as we had no major maintenance outages in the quarter, compared to the 165,000 tons of major maintenance outage that we took in the June quarter.  Even though we had no planned maintenance or economic downtime in the quarter, our containerboard system inventories were very tight throughout.  ", "Our export markets were strong and we exported 246,000 tons in the quarter, an increase of 37,000 tons over the quarter, as I mentioned in the face of stable to strong demand, depending upon the market, setting the basis for higher prices we\u2019re seeing for the calendar quarter.  Our exports to Latin America were approximately 40% of total export containerboard shipments based on the agricultural seasons in Latin America.  Our exports to Europe and the Middle East were 50% of total exports, and exports to Asia 10%.", "Higher containerboard and box shipments and lower fiber and energy costs increased segment income by 39 million and increased segment EBITDA margins by 240 basis points to 13.7%.  As I mentioned earlier, given the late September timing of publication of the containerboard price increase, it had little effect on our overall pricing which on an integrated basis was down slightly on lower box pricing and mix.  We show an EBITDA (inaudible) for the segment on Slide 9 reflecting the dollar effect and these other factors on a sequential quarter basis, which I won\u2019t detail in this call. ", "Our consumer segment operated well during the quarter.  Revenues were up 5% over the preceding quarter.  (Inaudible) shipments per day were up 3% primarily due to seasonal strengthening, and segment earnings, which include the contract settlement I mentioned earlier, were up 15 million as volume gains contributed 6 million, more than offsetting the $4 million reduction due to price and mix.", "During the quarter, we took a total of five days of economic downtown in our coated recycled mills to balance our production to our customer demand.  Our CRB backlogs strengthened since mid-quarter and we didn\u2019t take any economic downtime in October, and we don\u2019t expect to take any in November.  Pricing has been very competitive in both folding cartons and folding carton paperboard grades.", "Our merchandise and display operations had another very good quarter, as we expected, with seasonally higher revenues of 12 million and earnings of 4 million than Q3.  Our recycling segment lost 2.8 million in the quarter as sharply lower recycled fiber prices, which balanced the rest of our business, compressed margins in this segment and we took a $2 million lower cost to market charge on plant inventories and we had a $1.6 million bad debt charge in this segment.  ", "We made a leadership change in recycling in July 2012 followed by many changes throughout the organization that we did in order to facilitate the execution of the integration plan we developed for the former Smurfit plants and operations that will essentially bring them into conformity with the prior RockTenn recycling business model.  As a part of that restructuring, we reduced our staffing levels by 40 people, mostly in front and mid-office positions, and that will result in about $8 million in annual cost reductions.  We also closed or are exiting from six recycling plants and we have plans to optimize the balance of our plant footprint to conform to our mill system requirements and to our return expectations for our west coast plants.  ", "Looking to our outlook for the December quarter and for fiscal 2013, let\u2019s start with free cash flow growth, which we measure as cash available for dividends, pension contributions in excess of pension expense, and debt repayment.  For fiscal 2013, we expect to increase cash flow available for these purposes by about 25% to approximately 650 to 675 million or an increase of about 130 to 150 million over 2012.  Achieving this goal will represent approximately $9 per share in cash flow available for those purposes.  Our estimate of free cash flow is based on, among other factors, our current outlook for domestic and international markets for our products and for commodity input costs.  We expect that the net benefit to earnings realized from 2013 from the phase-in of the containerboard and box price increases will be about 270 million, but we believe this will be partially offset by lower pulp, paperboard, and folding carton pricing that based on today\u2019s current market prices we estimate to be about 60 million on an annual basis.  We also expect to see higher energy prices primarily for natural gas, somewhat higher virgin fiber costs, and if current Chinese demand and higher pricing in the export markets continues to strengthen, higher OCC costs.  ", "Steve will detail changes in our depreciation and amortization expense, which we expect will be higher; full-year outage amortization, as we have the first full amortization across fiscal 2013, and as you know it\u2019s built over 2012 because of the acquisition accounting; as well as he\u2019ll detail changes in operating costs and update our expectations for synergies and performance improvements.  ", "I also want to point out there are several actions we are taking this year that will alter the slope of our quarterly earnings in 2013 from that in 2012.  First, in comparison to last year, we plan to accelerate our major maintenance outages to better match our seasonal system demand; thus, we plan to take approximately 28,000 tons of maintenance outage downtime in the December quarter and we\u2019ll take the majority of our downtime \u2013 117,000 tons \u2013 in the March quarter.  ", "As a result, we\u2019d expect that December quarter earnings will be somewhat lower than this quarter as the beginning of the effects of the containerboard and box price increases are more than offset by maintenance outage expense, higher effective tax rate, and some book tax rate because of the difference between our book taxes and cash taxes, as you know, is a result of the carry forwards that we have; also, normal seasonal slowing towards the end of the quarter and seasonally increasing recycled fiber pricing, and also we\u2019ll build some containerboard inventory in the fourth quarter and again into January and February which we need to support our system demand during the heavy maintenance outage months to come.", "We estimate that March quarter earnings will be the lowest quarterly earnings for the year based on the high degree of containerboard maintenance outage downtime, also the major maintenance outage downtime from the 24-month outage we\u2019ll take at our Demopolis bleached paperboard mill, typical seasonal weakness in demand in early January and early February, and then seasonally higher winter fiber pricing and energy use in our mills.  Again, based on our current outlook and assuming pass-through of the October box price increase, our earnings should build significantly in our third fiscal quarter to our seasonally strongest fourth fiscal quarter earnings.", "Steve, I\u2019ll turn it over to you.", "Steven Voorhees", "Thanks, Jim.  At the end of September, our net debt was 3.4 billion.  Our credit agreement EBITDA was about 1.8 billion, and our credit agreement debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.96 times.  Liquidity was 935 million at the end of the quarter.  In September, we issued an additional 700 million in notes with maturities during the years 2020 and 2023.  We also extended the maturity of our credit facility through September of 2017.  Of our 3.4 billion in debt outstanding, approximately 70% matures in or after 2017.  Our credit agreement leverage ratio covenant will remain at 3.75 times through the end of the current fiscal year 2013.  Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity continue to be in good shape to support our business.", "We made additional progress on integration during the September quarter.  We are continuing to process converting the required box plants to a standard operating system and have installed the system in 14 of our locations, and we expect to complete the installation across our box plant system during fiscal year \u201914.  We continue to focus on box plant operating improvements and have closed 13 box plants and have closed or are exiting six recycling facilities.  As of September 30, our run rate of achieved synergies and performance improvements was in excess of $250 million.  Approximately 57% of this is in administrative areas, procurement and energy.  Approximately 20% is in the mills, and 23% is in the box plants and other operational areas.  The benefits of the synergies and performance improvements have been more than offset by lower market pricing for containerboard and corrugated packaging, as well as ongoing inflation in our business for labor, including wages and health insurance. ", "We expect theses headwinds to continue during fiscal year \u201913 when we expect approximately 70 million of increased wages and health insurance cost, 30 million of increased depreciation expense, and recognize an additional 36 million in expense related to deferred mill outage cost.  These cost increases will be mitigated by increases to our run rate of synergies and performance improvements.  During fiscal year \u201913, we expect to generate an additional 135 million in synergies and performance improvements over FY12 and achieve a run rate of 400 million by the end of the year.  The 135 million will be generated from 55 million in improvements at our containerboard mills, 35 million in our box plants, 10 million in our recycling operations, and 35 million fro other areas including procurement.", "Cash restructuring costs for plant closures, acquisition and integration expenses were 15 million during the fourth quarter, 79 million over the past 15 months since the acquisition date.  Over the same 15 months, we received 42 million in cash proceeds from the sale of real estate and equipment.  The net cash costs of 37 million are much better than our initial expectations and consequently have had a positive impact on our cash flow over the past 15 months.  ", "Turning to our key cost inputs, the largest cost drivers during the quarter were wood and fiber costs.  These costs increased almost 7 million on a sequential quarter basis due primarily to wet weather in the south.  Our composite index for recycled fiber cost declined by $29 a ton from the June quarter, creating a benefit of 26 million as compared to the June quarter.  Market prices for recovered fiber reached a low point in the September quarter and have increased since then.  We expect some upward trend from here.  Our recycled fiber composite index averaged $93 per ton during the quarter as compared to $122 per ton during the June quarter.  ", "Although natural gas prices are higher than the recent past, they continue to be attractive.  The current 12-month (inaudible) of approximately $3.85 per MBtu compares to an average price of $2.83 per MBtu in fiscal year \u201912.  Our current run rate of natural gas consumption is 29 Bcf per year.  Our annual consumption will increase to approximately 32 Bcf when we begin to capture the benefits from our remaining three fuel oil to natural gas conversion projects at the Fernandina Beach, Hopewell, and West Point mills.  Based on our current forward prices, we expect these three fuel oil to natural gas conversion projects to reduce annual energy costs by $30 million per year.", "Turning to our guidance for certain financial statistics, we\u2019re estimating depreciation and amortization for the year at 555 million.  We expect corporate cost in the range of 95 to 100 million for the fiscal year.  We expect interest expense to be in the range of 110 to 115 million for the year, including 30 million for the December quarter.  Our book tax rate for the September quarter was 31%.  This was lower than we expected primarily due to year-end adjustments to our state tax provisions in light of the first full year of operations of the larger company.  We expect our book tax rate for the first quarter and fiscal year 2013 to be approximately 37%.  At September 30, we have unused tax items that total approximately 376 million.  These can be used to reduce future federal cash taxes.  ", "We expect to fully utilize the 150 million in federal net operating losses during the course of fiscal year \u201913 and fiscal year \u201914.  We will use our remaining 226 million in cellulose biofuel alternative interim tax and other federal credits over the following two to three years, depending on our taxable income.  These tax items exclude the unrecorded asset related to additional federal net operating losses that will be available as the Smurfit-Stone black liquor tax credits claimed as an excise tax credit proved to be non-taxable.  If these tax credits do prove to be non-taxable, the tax benefit of our unused tax items will increase by 227 million to a total of 603 million.", "Turning to our pension assets and liabilities, we\u2019ve recorded an unfunded pension liability of approximately 1.5 billion, about 50 million higher than the 1.45 billion at the end of last year.  The liability increased by 522 million due to the decline in the discount rate used to calculate our liabilities.  For our U.S. plans, this rate declined from 5.27% to 4.22%.  This was a decline of 105 basis points.  Going forward, each 10 basis points impacts the unfunded liability by 42 million.  The recent pension funding legislation increased the interest rates used to calculate the required cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plans.  ", "After final work with our actuaries, we are estimating total required pension plan contributions at 208 million for fiscal year \u201913 and 303 million for fiscal year \u201914.  This is a significant reduction from our previous estimates.  Whether this funding reduction is a permanent reduction or a deferral of funding depends to a great extent on interest rate levels in 2015 and thereafter.  We expect to contribute 19 million to our pension plans in the December quarter.  In fiscal year \u201913, we expect lower pension expense for qualified plans of about 35 million for the full year as compared to 47 million of pension expense during fiscal year \u201912.  We estimate that our pension funding in excess of expense will be 173 million in fiscal year \u201913, 132 million lower than fiscal year \u201912.  ", "We estimate that the expenses related to deferred outage costs for the containerboard and bleached paperboard mills will be 93 million, as outlined in the table on Page 16.  As previously noted, in FY13 this expense is expected to be 36 million higher than we experienced in fiscal year \u201912.", "That concludes our prepared remarks.  Jim and I are now available to respond to your questions.", "Question and Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you.  [Operator instructions]", "Your first question comes from George Staphos, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America", "Thanks.  Hi everyone, good morning.  Thanks for taking my question.  I guess the first question that I had was related to the paper supply agreement.  Would it be possible to give us a bit more color in terms of what led to that cancellation of the agreement and the settlement, and why you included it in earnings?  And then I had two quick follow-ons.", "Operator", "One moment, please.  Please stand by, your conference call will resume momentarily.  Again, thank you for standing by.  The call will resume momentarily.", "James Rubright", "Are you there, Gwen?", "Operator", "Yes, sir.  You\u2019re back online.", "James Rubright", "Okay.  We had a power outage here and we were cut off, I think, as soon as George was being introduced with a question.  So if we could resume with George, that would be fantastic.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America", "Good morning.  I guess the first question I had was could you give us a bit more color on that paper supply agreement that you wound up settling and including in earnings, and then I had two quick follow-ons.", "James Rubright", "George, we signed a confidentiality agreement in connection with the settlement and termination, and I provided all the information we can provide, which is essentially the amount and the nature of the recovery.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay, I understand.  The next question I had was can you\u2014well, let me back up.  I\u2019m guessing that Hodge\u2019s production issues have to some degree not only impacted the benefits you thought you\u2019d get out of Hodge but also impacted the pace of your integration efforts around the rest of the system.  Could you confirm or provide additional color regarding that and perhaps give us a bit more color in terms of what integration work might now be able to accelerate as it appears that Hodge will be getting back to your ultimate production goals by the end of this year.", "James Rubright", "We started out the quarter producing at a rate of about 1,700 tons a day where the project on the lightweight mix that we currently had planned for Hodge would have been more in the 2,350 to 2,400 tons per day range.  So if you think of the $0.16, probably 8 million was\u2014approximately 8 million was simply straight-up margin on lost production, 5 or 6 million was really increased maintenance expenses.  We did the things we had to do that flowed out of the outage, and then the remainder was system disruption costs from the inefficiencies associated with making up the lightweight production from Hodge in other places.  So those are the components.", "The last 10 days, we\u2019ve been over 2,000 tons a day with all except for one day, and a lot of days we\u2019re in the 2,100 to 2,200 tons per day range, so if we can stabilize at that range, we\u2019ll get a substantial portion of the project benefits.  I mentioned in the call there were some things that were not done properly.  I don\u2019t really want to go into a lot of detail because there will be some likely claims dealt with associated with them, but we need to go back and fix two things that were done on the large paper machine five and do some other table improvements on four, and we\u2019ll do that in connection with two outages that we\u2019ll take over the first six months of this quarter, possibly into April \u2013 I guess that\u2019s really into the third quarter.  But a lot of it is simply a function of stabilizing operations.  As I mentioned, we really put a lot of resources in to assist the people at the mill with the technical expertise they needed, so it took a while for them to basically start at one end of the mill and work through and get everything stabilized.  But I feel that we are in a much better place at the outset of this quarter than we were last quarter and I think ultimately the project benefits are going to be realized.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America", "", "Okay.  Thanks for that, Jim.  The last question, I guess, on exports \u2013 it would seem that export trends are a bit stronger than normal this time of the year.  Can you comment as to what you\u2019re seeing in the market and what is driving that phenomenon, if in fact you agree with that view?  Thank you.", "James Rubright", "Yeah, whether it\u2019s stronger than it otherwise would be is difficult to say.  We\u2019ve said pretty consistently if you don\u2019t\u2014once you got out of November, December and January where the export markets got really torn up, export demand has been okay.  It\u2019s really been\u2014is very consistent with our expectations for the markets, and it took a while for pricing to stabilize and turn up but now we\u2019re seeing good export pricing across most of the market.  So I think we\u2019re going to see 35 to $40 a ton higher export pricing probably for most of this quarter after October, so I\u2019m pretty optimistic about where we are in export markets.  ", "As you know, for us the significant decline in export pricing was a major contributor to the reduction in our earnings from our expectations at the outset of the year, as was the reduction in pulp pricing which is material to us.  It\u2019s highly cyclical, as you know, and it really does appear that we\u2019ve hit a cyclical bottom and we\u2019re starting to see improving pulp pricing as well.  But we\u2019re not very good at predicting the slope of recovery in pulp pricing, so I think we\u2019re probably using some pretty conservative expectations in our cash flow guidance for next year with respect to what\u2019s going to happen to pulp markets, and potentially with respect to export markets.  ", "But demand is not the issue in the export containerboard markets.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America", "", "Okay, thank you.  I\u2019ll turn it over.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Phil Gresh, JPMC.", "Phil Gresh \u2013 JP Morgan", "Good morning.  I just want a little bit of clarification on Hodge.  I believe last quarter it was a $0.09 headwind, and then this quarter you\u2019re talking about a $0.15 headwind relative to your expectations.  So I just wanted to clarify what your expectations actually were heading into this quarter.  Is it fair to say that we should think about kind of a peak to trough impact from this as the $0.09 plus the $0.15, or just wanted to calibrate that a little bit.", "James Rubright", "No, it\u2019s a good question because if you don\u2019t know what our expectations were in the third quarter compared to the fourth quarter, it\u2019s pretty difficult to understand what we\u2019re saying.  We knew the mill was going to be down because of all the work we were going to do for an extended period of time during the third quarter, so therefore you\u2019re going to have very low production and then all the cash maintenance expense in the quarter, which although you amortize, you really don\u2019t make up the production loss and the system disruption.  So our expectations included a very significant amount of expense in the third quarter but when the mill came up at the end of the quarter, it came up in a state that was not what we expected and therefore it cost us $0.09 more in the quarter than it would have, than we expected.", "In this quarter, we assumed we could achieve a run rate of production faster than we\u2019ve been able to achieve it, and therefore I went through the components of the difference between what we expected and what we achieved in response to George\u2019s call, and that\u2019s how you get the $0.15.", "Phil Gresh \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay.  So any way you could calibrate what you think you would be able to get back this quarter on an EPS basis, or should we should just take your prior comments?", "James Rubright", "No, I think it\u2019s going to be somewhere between $0.10 and $0.15 back from Hodge, depending on how consistently we can run at the run rates that we\u2019ve achieved today and whether we ramp up further in anticipation of the outages, or whether we simply have to get through the outages.  But it\u2019s somewhere between $0.10 and $0.15 improvement from Hodge.", "Phil Gresh \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay.  And then it sounds like you expect the full improvement to be after the maintenance outages, so perhaps on a six to nine-month basis we\u2019re kind of back to where we should be?", "James Rubright", "Yeah, I think if my recollection right, the Hodge last maintenance\u2014second maintenance outage is in April.  It\u2019s either April or May, but in any event there are some things we have to do that we can\u2019t do until then that will ultimately set things right.", "Phil Gresh \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay.  And then just on the price increases, it sounds like the timing was maybe a bit longer than some of what your peers highlighted.  You called out some customer contracts.  Maybe you can just elaborate on that a little bit \u2013 is there an opportunity here moving forward to change some of the terms of perhaps those contracts, or how should we think about that?", "James Rubright", "Yeah, it\u2019s a half-empty, half-full.  If you take the slightly less than 7 million tons of domestic containerboard sales and multiply that times $50, assuming you pass through every dollar for the year, it\u2019d be about 330 million.  The thing didn\u2019t publish until September and then box prices\u2014you know, increases were effective in October, and everybody has some contracts that they pass through and so forth.  So the 270 million that we said we would recover is about 80% of the total, which we\u2019ll recover over this fiscal year, which since our year starts in October doesn\u2019t compare to others\u2019 calendar years.  I can\u2019t look into other people\u2019s books and contractual situations.  ", "The thing you need to remember about our contracts are if you lag on the way up, you also lag on the way down, so it simply is a trade that I\u2019m not sure in all cases we would necessarily find in our interest to try to negotiate out of.  But the bottom line is that in the first year of the increase, we\u2019re going to get about 80% of potential benefit that we would have realized had we gotten 100% of it on the first day of the fiscal year.", "Phil Gresh \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay.  All right, thanks a lot.  I\u2019ll turn it over.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Weintraub, Buckingham Research Group.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Hi, thank you.  If I could\u2014so if you\u2019re expecting about a $0.10 to $0.15 benefit hopefully from Hodge in the December quarter, and we should be getting some benefit from pricing although, I guess, not fully clear how much of that ramps through into the December quarter, and yet you\u2019re anticipating kind of flattish to down-ish quarter versus quarter.  How much of that is the seasonal, and can you kind of help us with that bridging a little bit, please?", "James Rubright", "Sure.  We had an $18 million contractual settlement in our fourth fiscal quarter that we will not have in the first fiscal quarter of 2013.  Our effective book tax rate was 30 or 31%, and we expect it to be 37%; so those two things will more than offset the increase we anticipate from Hodge.  And then as I mentioned, we will take 28,000 tons of maintenance downtime.  We will build inventory during the fourth fiscal quarter in anticipation of the outages going forward.  When you build inventory, you don\u2019t record the gain on the sale, right?  And then because you\u2019re going into the winter, you\u2019ll have higher energy usage particularly in the mills, and then if you have normal seasonal trends in December and it starts to get wet, you\u2019re going to see a little bit higher fiber costs.  So all of those things will seasonally affect our business, and that\u2019s why we forecast somewhat down earnings from the $1.39 that we earned in the last quarter.", "Now, I would just remind you that if you look at our input costs and the materiality of them and why we don\u2019t try to give very precise earnings guidance, recycled fiber for us\u2014a $10 change in recycled fiber is $40 million a year, $10 in a quarter.  I promise you, in the 13 years I\u2019ve been here, we haven\u2019t been able to guess or forecast full-year recycled fiber prices within $10, and if there was a year when we did it, it was luck.  Natural gas pricing is also about $25 million a year to us, and it\u2019s going to 40 when we complete those projects.  Again, $0.50 up or down in natural gas pricing is simply beyond our ability to forecast, and we use 19 million tons of trees in a year, so you can do the math on a $0.50 change in virgin fiber pricing over the year.  Again, these things are not within those tolerances.", "They tend to balance and they balance nicely over the course of a fiscal year, so while we have a pretty high degree of confidence of our ability to generate the $9 in free cash flow we said we\u2019d generate over the course of the fiscal year, my confidence with respect to fine-tuning earnings on a quarterly basis is simply not that high.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Okay, fair enough.  And just real quickly on the pension, if I heard you correctly, the discount rate, that had about a $522 million negative impact but the pension underfunding was only a $50 million change, so what was the positive 475?", "Steven Voorhees", "We contributed 300 million-some odd into the pension plan, and we also earned investment returns on the assets that we have.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Got it.  Thank you.", "James Rubright", "Don\u2019t we detail that in the appendix?", "Steven Voorhees", "I don\u2019t think we do.", "James Rubright", "Oh, okay.", "Steven Voorhees", "It will be flushed out in our 10-K when we file that.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chip Dillon, Vertical Research Partners.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "Hi, good morning.  First question is I know on the call, Jim, you mentioned sort of a free cash flow number that is available for pension contributions and debt reduction, et cetera of 650 to 675.  I think that was for \u201913.  What was that number for \u201912, and how do you exactly compute that quickly?", "James Rubright", "The number for \u201912 was 518 million, and the number for \u201913 is the number you just indicated.  In \u201913, assuming no acquisitions, we would use it for dividends, pension contributions in excess of pension expense, and for debt repayment.", "Now, going back on why we treat pension contributions in excess of expense as a dollar for our shareholders is simply the fact that we assumed a largely closed pension liability with respect to Smurfit that we simply treated as an acquisition liability.  Since you get a tax deduction for it, you have to look at it on an after-tax basis, so on the acquisition date we assumed it was about 700 million.  Our discount rate declined by 1%, as Steve mentioned, so it results in a very large increase in the GAAP liability; but the fact is funding is what matters, and because of the Pension Relief Act which recognizes what is a relatively unsustainably low interest cost at the current, they reduced the funding obligation so it really didn\u2019t change\u2014the increase in the liability was matched by what is a decrease in our funding obligation over time.  So whether that 1.5 billion turns out to be a real liability that we fund is a function of what interest rates are going to be in 2015 and beyond.", "But at any rate, those three things are the components.  Now in 2012, the number was 518 million.  Steve detailed the amount of pension contributions in excess of expense.  Dividend was $0.80 a share.  We did do 125 million in acquisitions, which we also count \u2013 those acquisitions have been nicely accretive.  We did not count the 17 million we used to purchase the lease out.  We didn\u2019t count the debt issuance expense or the premium on the redemption of the 16\u2019s.  But those are the components of those free cash flow elements and why we count them.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "Got you.  And given that depreciation and CAPEX from \u201912 to \u201913 don\u2019t really change a lot, and I know there might be some puts and takes, but it looks like if you go up by the amount that you indicate, that in essence as we look out\u2014I know it\u2019s early days, that increment is about $2 a share.  And it looks like all things being equal, that would be kind of a ballpark guess as to how you see 2013 on an EPS basis versus \u201912.  Am I reading that correctly?", "James Rubright", "Well, except you\u2019ve got a book tax rate of 37% and a tax provision that is significantly lower than that as a result of all the tax credits.  So you have to take into account\u2014", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "Make that adjustment.", "James Rubright", "--cash tax.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "Got you.  So in other words, the EPS may be a little less because of the fact that you have a higher book tax rate, if I\u2019m hearing you correctly, although you\u2019ll have less cash taxes.", "James Rubright", "Yeah.  The NOLs are available and you can use a portion of the other tax benefits.  It doesn\u2019t offset 100% of your tax provision, and they generally don\u2019t offset a lot of the state taxes that you pay, and then there are other taxes that you pay.  So you will have some cash taxes even in a year in which better NOLs would have offset all of your federal taxes.  But I don\u2019t remember exactly what our\u2014we can follow up later with what we expect in terms of cash taxes, but there will be a very significant difference between the book and cash tax rate.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "Got you.  And one last quick one \u2013 it looks like from fourth quarter to fourth quarter, the segment EBIT in packaging was down about a fourth \u2013 you know, 43 million; and certainly Hodge was part of it but you did have some offset, I guess, from the settlement.  My question is if you looked at published OCC prices, and again they may not be exacting matching to your experience, it looks like they were down somewhere on the order of $70 year-over-year.  Given your purchases, it would seem like that could have been a 50 million benefit that I know could have been offset by other things, but am I in the ballpark there, and are there other things you could point to that might have offset some of that benefit?", "James Rubright", "Yeah, I didn\u2019t follow all of the numbers that you cited at the beginning, so I can\u2019t track through or confirm the predicate cash.  But with respect to OCC itself, our purchases are a little over 4 million tons a year, so on a headline basis there\u2019s a credit with respect to the pass-through of that ultimately into the mill system.  But we sell a significant amount of DLK and there\u2019s an offset of DLK, and then it also compresses margins in our recycling business.  So I think a $40 a ton change in OCC pricing, it\u2019d probably be $30 a ton flow-through to RockTenn.  And Steve, if I\u2019m off on that, let me know; but I think that\u2019s about what we would realize.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "Yeah, I was just citing the market pricing.  RICI is saying that it was down about 70 third calendar quarter this year versus third calendar quarter last year, so even if you cut that by a third, you\u2019d still be looking at\u2014I don\u2019t know, $32 million, and assuming you don\u2019t use the full 4 million, just maybe 3 million-plus for your corrugated segment.  So I didn\u2019t know if\u2014", "James Rubright", "You\u2019re not wrong.  The thing that\u2014from a book income standpoint, you\u2019ll recall that because of the acquisition accounting, we started out at zero with respect to maintenance outage expense, and then as we had four quarters of maintenance outages and since we amortize it over the course of the year, that then built.  Our full run rate of amortization of maintenance outage is about $80 million a year, which we\u2019ll have next year, so that\u2019s 20 million a quarter; but in the third quarter, if you go back a full year, we would have had one or two quarters of amortization.  So that\u2019s a major book difference in income.", "And then as I mentioned, essentially for the last 15 to 17 months, we\u2019ve been sitting there without a containerboard price increase in a generally healthy market.  If you don\u2019t have an increase, you\u2019re going to typically see erosion, particularly in a relatively weak economy, and we\u2019ve indicated we felt we had over $200 million in price erosion over the period of time from January of 2011, when we first announced the Smurfit transaction, until the end of the summer when we announced the price increase, and I guess we announced it in August and it ultimately became effective in September.  So that was the major offsetting factor.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "Got it.  ", "Steven Voorhees", "Chip, the maintenance outage item that Jim mentioned had an impact of $18 million on the year-over-year comparison that you were talking about.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "Okay.  And obviously if you annualize that 200 million of pricing, that\u2019s 50 million, which is what I was looking for, so that\u2019s very helpful.  Thank you.", "James Rubright", "And all that 200 million wasn\u2019t all\u2014it\u2019d be wrong to think that\u2019s domestic containerboard, because it includes export containerboard, it excludes export pulp pricing, and some erosion in the consumer segment.  You know, there was a price decline published for both FBS and CRB, so I think if you heard me say it first, you would have thought that was all box pricing and that\u2019s just not right.  It was spread across our business.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "Which by the way, I notice you did for the first time split out your pulp between the two segments, and I didn\u2019t realize so much of it was in containerboard, so that makes all the sense in the world.  Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Philip Ng, Jefferies.", "Philip Ng \u2013 Jefferies", "Morning, guys.  Just curious to get your thoughts on your price mix dynamic for corrugated.  It was down sequentially.  I would have thought it would have picked up with export prices moving higher, so just want to get some thoughts on that.", "James Rubright", "As I mentioned, there was sort of a period of continuing erosion which was relatively slight.  We didn\u2019t really see any significant benefit from export pricing or pulp pricing in the quarter; in fact, I believe they were lower.  So those things offset the small benefit that we got from the late publication of the containerboard price increase.", "Philip Ng \u2013 Jefferies", "Okay. And since you guys do have a box price increase coming in, that should be a positive.  I do remember last year during the seasonally slower period, you saw some box price erosion.  Certainly from a demand-supply dynamic, containerboard is a lot tighter now, so I just want to get some thoughts on that.  And then lastly, with this box price negotiation, is there an opportunity for you to reset the contracts so you have a quicker pass-through going forward?", "James Rubright", "As I\u2019ve indicated, I\u2019m not of the view that we really need to make adjustments in our contracts.  Those contracts have generally benefited us with respect to stability, and pass-throughs, as I mentioned, that you might lose them on the way up, you get them on the way back down.  So I just think it is an element of our business that really doesn\u2019t sort of stand at the forefront of our thinking.", "As I said, in this fiscal year, we\u2019re going to get 80% of the price increase just as we model out the price increase, and just because of timing we didn\u2019t get it all in October.  So it\u2019s not\u2014I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right thing to focus on from our standpoint, and it\u2019s not really something that we have as a priority.", "Philip Ng \u2013 Jefferies", "Okay.  And then can you give us some mileposts on the synergies?  I know Hodge has been a drag for you guys, but going forward can you talk about some of the opportunities and some of the major projects that you have in place, and the timing of it?", "James Rubright", "Well, I think Steve detailed where it is from a segment standpoint, and there is a slide on that.  The 250 million is a lot of purchasing synergies and then some business improvements across the mill system.  We do reduce it by the effective loss at Hodge because we feel like that was part of what we anticipated as a performance improvement, and since it\u2019s a drag we netted that out to get down to the 250 million.", "I think the largest single component of increased benefit over the course of the next 12 million is the 40\u2014what did we say, 40 or 50 million from the remaining three natural gas projects\u2014", "Steven Voorhees", "Yeah, it\u2019s 30 on the three projects.  If you include Stevenson, it\u2019s in the 40 to 45 range.", "James Rubright", "Yeah \u2013 30 left, natural gas projects.  There\u2019s a significant amount of actual turnaround in the recycling division, both from the standpoint of plant consolidation and headcount reduction that I mentioned.  Steve, purchasing, we think we\u2019re going to get another, what?", "Steven Voorhees", "Around 30.", "James Rubright", "Another 30, so there are a number of components like that.  Our box plant operations are going to improve significantly as a result of a lot of things we did this year.  You didn\u2019t see the full run rate of benefit of the plant closures we\u2019ve made, and we continue to look at opportunities to improve the overall cost structure and performance of the box plant system.  So they\u2019re pretty well spread across the entire business unit.", "Philip Ng \u2013 Jefferies", "Okay, thanks guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Alex Ovshey, Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thanks, good morning.  On the SBS side, can you just talk about what kind of impact you may be seeing on the pricing side from some of the new capacity that\u2019s coming online in Asia, and whether or not you expect to see potential for a more material decline in SBS prices as that capacity fully ramps up?", "James Rubright", "Well, I certainly think that the $20 price decrease that we saw in SBS was a result of lower, essentially, order backlogs or unfilled orders in SBS, and I think that that partly reflected availability and therefore lower backlogs, the availability I think was created by the pushback into the U.S. of exported SBS.  It\u2019s a little\u2014and I\u2019m doing it based on reported numbers.  We don\u2019t have the visibility really because we don\u2019t export SBS, but certainly the global growth of coated boards in Asia combined with the decline in Asian demand contributed to that.", "We see it as relatively stable right now, and if you look at operating rates of domestic bleached board mills, they\u2019ve been in the\u2014I think last week it was 94%.  But they have been in the low to mid-90s pretty consistently for a while now, and our unfilled orders as reported for the industry have been relatively stable, so I don\u2019t see conditions changing now.", "Looking into the future at what rate China will actually bring on coated capacity, whether they\u2019ll slow it down, at what rate China and the rest of Asia is going to grow are things that are very difficult to forecast, so I can\u2019t say whether conditions are going to improve, stay the same or get worse as we move over the next six to nine to 24 months.", "Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay Jim, that\u2019s fair.  And then just putting together all the information you gave us on the benefit of higher containerboard prices, the change in the free cash flow level next year versus this year, do you also have an estimate on when you would expect to hit your targeted leverage ratio of less than 2 times?", "James Rubright", "Steve, do you have a view with respect to that?  I think that it\u2019s optimistic to think that we\u2019d get there within 12 months, but it\u2019s not optimistic beyond that.", "Steven Voorhees", "I\u2019d agree with that.", "Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay, thank you very much.  Helpful.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Connelly, CLSA.", "Mark Connelly \u2013 CLSA", "Thank you.  Jim, two things \u2013 as your portfolio reshapes with the box plant closures and everything else you\u2019re doing, are we going to see your net export exposure change either in size or geography much from what you laid out for us earlier?  And the second question \u2013 most of the companies we\u2019re hearing from this quarter are telling us they\u2019re not concerned about fiber availability or cost this winter.  Your comments are a little more focused, I assume, on just weather, or is there anything regional that you\u2019re looking at as well?", "James Rubright", "Okay, thanks Mark.  I\u2019ll take the second question first.  We may be more pessimistic than others.  I have seen what others have said, but it\u2019s our forecast and a lot of it is winter weather.  There is stuff specifically in our Virginia markets where we have our West Point and Hopewell mills.  We\u2019ve decided it\u2019s a good idea to burn trees for electric power in the United States, and so we have some wood burners that are coming onstream in the Virginia market, and then there\u2019s a competitor that\u2019s bringing up a mill in the Virginia market.  So I think there where we\u2019ve got over a million tons of capacity, we\u2019re going to see some regional pressure on virgin fiber pricing; but again, I haven\u2019t tried to pencil out everybody else\u2019s.", "And then if you don\u2019t mind, Mark, please ask me your first question again.", "Mark Connelly \u2013 CLSA", "Sure.  Just wondering \u2013 you had given us a nice layout of all of your export exposure.  I\u2019m just curious whether you think that\u2019s going to change, either geographically or in size, given what you\u2019re doing with your portfolio over the next year or so.", "James Rubright", "Okay, thanks.  No, I don\u2019t think it will change.  We set a very high bar for ourselves with respect to business retention in box plant closures, and we\u2019re above 90% at the current run rate with respect to retention of business as we close.  We\u2019re higher than that in folding cartons, but because of the shifting radius of the folding carton plant and the box plant (inaudible) can\u2019t have the same answer; but 90% is fine.  And given the effectiveness of the redoing of our sales effort and so forth and the fact that our volumes are growing, I think actually that our domestic system will expand.  ", "The best way to grow your system is to be cost competitive, which we are making significant strides on, so I would say no.  I think you\u2019ll see us in about the same mix of export to domestic, although it really depends on how effective we are growing domestically.  But I don\u2019t see it declining.", "Mark Connelly \u2013 CLSA", "Super.  Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Anthony Pettinari, Citigroup.", "Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citigroup", "Good morning.  You discussed some amount of capital spending getting bumped from 2012 to 2013, and I\u2019m wondering\u2014I think previously you discussed a CAPEX run rate for the system of 350 million over the long term.  I was wondering if that\u2019s still applicable and if you think you can there by 2014.  And then maybe kind of a related question \u2013 I think previously you had said that the net capacity increase from all of the performance improvements and capital investments once they\u2019re all completed, I guess, by 2014 would be 600,000 tons, and I\u2019m wondering if you could give any update on that.", "James Rubright", "Yeah, that\u2019s the gross capacity increase.  It\u2019s not net.  We did close our Matane, Quebec mill.  That was an 180,000 ton reduction.  The last piece of the production increase would be a project at Hopewell that we had estimated doing in \u201913 and then we switched that to \u201913 and \u201914.  So the net increase if all we do is reduce Matane would be about 400,000 tons; but we\u2019ve pretty consistently said we\u2019re only going to produce to our system demand, but the effect of these projects is to significantly reduce the cost of production and really modernize the affected mills.  So I don\u2019t know what the net production change will be, but the production capacity change if we did it today would be about 400,000 tons, and that still is a good estimate.", "With respect to CAPEX, sustained CAPEX for the system could be 350 million, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve given that out in our guidance.  What it will be will depend upon opportunities that we see at the time, and the 480 to 500 and then $400 million estimates for \u201912 and \u201913, we really haven\u2019t changed them.  It\u2019s just spread over the course of those two years.", "Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citigroup", "Great.  Thanks for the clarification.  And then maybe just one final question \u2013 you\u2019ve obviously got a number of facilities in the northeast, the mid-Atlantic.  Can you discuss what impact on operations or production, if any, you\u2019ve seen from Hurricane Sandy; and given your inventories are relatively lean and industry inventories are pretty lean, do you think the hurricane could have an impact on the containerboard industry?", "James Rubright", "Yes, thank you for raising that question because it\u2019s something we should cover.  With respect to our major facilities, we did not sustain any significant damage so we were fortunate in that respect, and our people did a great job of taking the actions they needed to take to secure the facilities.  As a result, although we had some production reductions in our containerboard and paperboard systems, and there will be some costs associated with that, the assets were well protected and they\u2019re back operating.", "Because of the transportation disruption in the northeast, recycled fiber access depending upon the marketplace has been somewhat challenging.  We have a very large mill in Syracuse, New York; another recycled mill in Connecticut, another one in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, so fiber supply into those mills has been affected but they are operating.  So there is some cost associated with that that would be difficult to estimate.", "We have several \u2013 and I\u2019m going to say four or five \u2013 box plants in the northeast region that today cannot operate.  The transportation network and the power supply simply doesn\u2019t exist to allow them to operate, and then more seriously is the disruption of our customer base in the northeast.  And as you point out, we do have a large concentration of plants and sales in the northeast United States so it is impossible at this juncture to estimate the total amount of loss because it\u2019s impossible to estimate the effect on demand and any effect on the ability of customers in the northeast to produce.", "So I would say that while it will be noticeable for us and it will probably occur primarily in this quarter, it\u2019s difficult for me to estimate that effect but there will be one.", "Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citigroup", "Thank you.  I\u2019ll turn it over.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Al Kabili, Credit Suisse.", "Al Kabili \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Hi, thanks.  Good morning guys.  I jumped on early and so you may have addressed this, but just on the box price realization occurring mostly at the end of March, it seems a little bit more of a delay versus some of the larger peers have indicated.  I was wondering if you could address that, particularly as you have less vertical integration on the box side as well.", "James Rubright", "Well, I\u2019m going to clarify what I said because if I said what you repeated back to me, it\u2019s not what I intended to say.  What we said was we would have realized the majority of the increase on a run rate basis by the end of the second quarter.  That doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to get it all then, not now.  In fact, if you do the math on what I\u2019ve said and we get 270 million over the course of a year of a universe of 330 million, you would see that we will be recovering a significant portion of that over the course of the next two quarters, and it is on a ramp-up basis.  But we will have the vast majority of what we will recover in total by the end of the March quarter.", "Al Kabili \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay.  And is that just the delay in the timing, or the lag in the timing, is that just all contractually related?  Can you just talk about how the non-contract pricing is\u2014how you see the non-contract pricing shaping up?  Is that going to be considerably that that end of March period?", "James Rubright", "Well, certainly you\u2019re open\u2014if you\u2019re not limited by a contract, and particularly if it\u2019s containerboard to the independent market, that is the clearest opportunity to increase prices that will benefit the full quarter.  With respect to the box price increase, as you know, some people announced the box price increase October 1.  There were other competitors who announced October 22, 23, or whatever, so you have an issue with respect to specific accounts, with respect to when the increase could be effective.  And in other situations, you may face competitive issues that may limit your ability to get it on any particular day, and everybody faces those issues.", "I can\u2019t speak to our competitors\u2019 realizations or what they\u2019ve said.  I\u2019m just telling you we have modeled out our system, and that modeling suggests that over the course of this year, we\u2019re going to get 270 million of the increase is our best estimate.", "Al Kabili \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, all right.  Thank you, I appreciate that.  I guess just also quickly on Hodge, if you can just comment\u2014I think operationally it\u2019s a little better.  Assuming kind of where we are today in terms of how Hodge is running, is there an appreciable tailwind in \u201913 versus \u201912 given the rebuild issues, or if you can address kind of how you see the expected improvement in Hodge.  Thank you.", "James Rubright", "Yeah.  I think based on the higher cost that we\u2019ve incurred there, the project is in the range of $100 million and we expect a return in the 20 to 25% range today.  That\u2019s really\u2014you know, the return\u2019s down because the cost of the project is up, but on a full run rate basis that\u2019s about what we expect in terms of the improvement over a 2011 operating baseline.  I think I\u2019ve detailed pretty clearly what we think is the effect in the fourth fiscal quarter would be as well as the next quarter coming forward, and then achieving the balance of it after the April\u2014I believe it\u2019s the April second outage.", "Al Kabili \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay.  And then just one last quick one is just on consumer packaging \u2013 can you say how much of the pricing pressure we\u2019ve experienced in this fiscal fourth quarter, how much of the published price decreases and whatnot we\u2019ve experienced thus far, and what\u2019s left to go on that?  Thank you.", "James Rubright", "We\u2019ll have to follow up on that.  We\u2019ve said 60 million, and the 60 million includes a lot of things in addition to just folding carton price declines.  That\u2019s something we probably should just detail if you\u2019re interested in that and the specifics of that after the call.", "Al Kabili \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Okay, we\u2019ll follow up.  All right, good luck in the upcoming quarter.  Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dave Zorub, BlueMountain Capital.", "Dave Zorub \u2013 BlueMountain Capital", "Good morning.  A couple questions.  Apologize if I missed this, but the run rate of 250 million synergies at the end of the quarter, can you tell us just of that 250, how much was actually realized over the fiscal year that just ended?", "Steven Voorhees", "I don\u2019t have that number at my fingertips.  What I did try to express was the increase on a combined basis of \u201913 over \u201912, so we\u2019d have an additional 135 million in \u201913 over what we realized in \u201912.", "Dave Zorub \u2013 BlueMountain Capital", "So that 135 is actual dollars, not run rate exiting \u201913?", "Steven Voorhees", "Exactly.", "Dave Zorub \u2013 BlueMountain Capital", "Steve, could you give us a feel \u2013 would you expect the majority of that 135 to be a pick-up from the run rate exiting this year, or to be from these synergies--?", "Steven Voorhees", "Well, it\u2019s a combination of both, so we\u2019re at 250 at the end of fiscal year \u201912, and I said we\u2019d be up at 400 by the end of \u201913.  So there\u2019s projects coming and there\u2019s projects going out, but then that is relatively close between 135 realized versus an additional 150 run rate.", "Dave Zorub \u2013 BlueMountain Capital", "Okay, thank you.  And then stepping back for a moment, could you help us just think about the big picture for the business as we look out a couple years versus the plans that you\u2019ve laid out.  If I think about a bridge, you did 1178 of credit agreement EBITDA in the year, and if we don\u2019t think about for the moment \u201913 versus \u201914 or any particular time period but just big picture, Jim, I think you said the full benefit of the price increase would be something like 340 when realized.  And then you\u2019ve got arguably another of your 550 of synergies\u2014I don\u2019t know exactly what the right number is, but an incremental, maybe 300, something like that, so that\u2019s, call it, 550 to add to that base of 1178.  You mentioned the headwind of 60 million of pricing this coming year, not sure what other headwinds you would put against that.  But could you help us just sort of think about a big picture bridge for the business when we get to the end of \u201914?  You\u2019ve executed on the investments and presumably the returns in Smurfit, you know, conceptually what you envision the business profitability looking like at that time.", "James Rubright", "Well, I think you\u2019ve taken a number of the major components and said here are the potential increases in income.  I think from the\u2014what you have to take into account are the ramp of expenses that are going to offset some of that.  Our payroll is 2 billion, so put some percentage inflation on payroll and then add essentially healthcare and workers\u2019 compensation costs, and you see you\u2019ve got a fairly significant 60 to $70 million ramp every year there.  Add healthcare mandates, if they actually come to pass, and you\u2019ll see there\u2019s a fair run rate there, and then you have commodity cost inflation on all the other inputs.  Now, they\u2019re all cyclical, so where they are going to be at any point in time is a good question, but presumably they\u2019re going to match inflation, so you\u2019ve got to overcome the ramp of your increasing costs with cost declines, so some of the performance improvements are going to be used to overcome that ramp of other costs.  What other opportunities we\u2019ll have to reduce costs in our businesses, I can\u2019t say today; but it seems like we always find some, so it\u2019s a function of how much we can exceed the ramp in costs.", "And then as you get out to 2014, I\u2019d have to speculate with respect to what I thought containerboard domestic and export pricing would be, and it is not our policy to comment on our belief with respect to future actions with respect to containerboard pricing.  But it is fair to note that the industry is operating at very high operating rates as we speak and very low inventory rates, and my view with respect to the containerboard business generally I think is highly confirmed by the strength of export pricing, and notwithstanding the global depression returning and increasing export pricing for containerboard.  So again, you\u2019ve got to ask me what in 2014 do I think containerboard export pricing going to be, what is pulp pricing going to be, as well as what is going to happen to domestic containerboard pricing in an environment in which you have essentially a non-substitutable commodity in an economy that could potentially return to historic levels of growth of 3 to 4% instead of 1.5.", "So I actually think that we are pretty bearish with respect to the long-term prospects of our business because we tend to focus on potential cost increases and then not really focus on what potential revenue increases exist, either through further pricing initiatives or volume growth in a growing U.S. economy.", "Dave Zorub \u2013 BlueMountain Capital", "Okay, I appreciate that.  I guess one last question \u2013 I don\u2019t ever see much written about the impact that the housing market may or has had on your business; but given that there are some people who believe that we\u2019re starting to see perhaps finally the beginnings of a real recovery in housing, could you talk about just what kind of impact a recovery in housing could have on your business, if any?", "James Rubright", "Yes.  If you believe that housing drives a robust domestic economy, a restored demand for housing would be very positive for us in the long term because you\u2019d see\u2014again, you go back to that 3 or 4% economic growth in the United States and all of a sudden, you don\u2019t have enough containerboard capacity in North America, nor would you have enough paperboard capacity.  And again, if we were able to sustain or provide the basis for some global growth in the economy, particularly with the exporting countries that export into the United States, you could again have a higher rate of absorption of the capacity in Asia that we responded to a question about earlier.  So all of those things would be long-term positive.", "They also might be short-term negatives because if you had a spike in economic activity, the first thing you would see is a demand domestically for recycled fiber, so you could see short-term pressure on recycled fiber which is highly cyclical; and again, on the cost of energy, again dependent upon deliverability.  So you might see some short- term earnings pressure in an environment which was very healthy with respect to the long-term.", "Dave Zorub \u2013 BlueMountain Capital", "", "Do you have a sense for in sort of a more normal housing market, what kind of percentage impact that could have on volumes for containerboard?", "James Rubright", "No.  We\u2019ve always thought of packaging as GDP minus, because we\u2019re always figuring out ways to make packaging more efficient, make containerboard lighter and so forth.  So whatever GDP is growing, we\u2019re going to be something trailing that; but again, it would be easy to see GDP grow 3 or 4% because we\u2019ve done so significantly, and then if you had containerboard growing at 2.5, that would be in excess of creep, again contributing to further tightening of a relatively tight domestic containerboard market.", "Dave Zorub \u2013 BlueMountain Capital", "Okay.  And sorry, one last question which is really just a follow-up to my earlier.  I just wanted to make sure I was on the same page, but when we look at sort of the moving parts, and again using that 1178 of credit agreement EBITDA coming out of this past year, it looks like on a gross basis when we add in sort of the opportunity for price recovery and incremental synergies, that would get you somewhere close to 1.9 billion of EBITDA, and then against that we would have to factor in some of the expense headwinds you mentioned \u2013 pricing, healthcare, et cetera.  Is that sort of consistent with the way you look at the business?", "James Rubright", "I think you\u2019re asking me to more specific with respect to forecasting future EBITDA than would be wise for me to do.", "Dave Zorub \u2013 BlueMountain Capital", "Fair enough.  Thank you.", "Operator", "Once again, to ask a question please press star, one.  One moment, please.", "At this time, there are no further questions.", "James Rubright", "All right, thank you all very much for joining our call.", "Operator", "This does conclude today\u2019s conference.

My name is Julie. I will be your conference operator for today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Rock-Tenn First Quarter Fiscal 2013 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)", "As a reminder, slides are being presented today as part of the conference call. These slides can be accessed at www.rocktenn.com under the Investors page. Ladies and gentlemen, this call is being recorded today, January 23, 2013. (Operator Instructions).", "Your speakers for today\u2019s call are Mr. James Rubright, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Steve Voorhees, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Voorhees, you may begin your conference.", "Steve Voorhees", "Thanks, Julie. Good morning. Welcome to Rock-Tenn\u2019s First Quarter of 2013 Earnings Conference Call. I\u2019m Steve Voorhees, Chief Financial Officer; and I\u2019m joined this morning by Rock-Tenn\u2019s CEO, Jim Rubright.", "During the course of this call, Jim and I will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discussed. We describe this risks and uncertainties in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K.", "During the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. We provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the Appendix to the slide presentation, which is available on our website. Jim will begin with commentary on the performance of our businesses during the quarter, then I will discuss the status of the integration and various financial items. Jim?", "Jim Rubright", "Thanks, Steve. Our first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.35 are the result of strongly improving operating performance in our Corrugated and Recycling businesses and solid progress in recovering the fall containerboard and box price increases. Given the $0.04 per share non-cash deferred tax charge we took in the quarter that\u2019s attributable to a change in California corporate income tax laws and the apportionment factors we apply to our business, the implied $1.39 per share well exceeds our EPS guidance for the quarter from our last call where we forecast adjusted earnings to be down significantly from the $1.39 of last quarter and last quarter included that $0.18 per share gain from a favorable contract dispute settlement.", "Also, in light of a largely seasonal weakness in our Consumer business, which produced results well below last year and somewhat below our expectations and the fact that we incurred major maintenance outages at two mills in the quarter and build 74,000 tons of containerboard inventory in anticipation of the late winter and spring maintenance outages, the $28 million Corrugated segment income increase over the prior year and $25 million increase sequentially suggests how much our Corrugated segment performance is improving. Our EBITDA margin for the entire company for the quarter was 14.4% and 15.4% for our Corrugated segment.", "We generated a lot of cash in the quarter. Our net debt repayment was $155 million. We paid dividends of $32 million as we doubled up the dividend as a result of the change in the tax law and our pension contributions in excess of pension expense of $13 million, a total of $200 million for the quarter or $2.75 per share.", "As shown on the next slide, for the last 12 months, we generated $578 million in free cash flow available, and used for these purposes were $7.99 per share.", "During the quarter, our Corrugated business showed improving performance in essentially all respects. Domestic box demand held up better than we expected, with seasonally adjusted strong demand, particularly through late December and so far in January. Our domestic box volumes were up 3.2% over the prior year quarter. Containerboard demand for external sales was also strong.", "Although we reduced export shipments to certain markets to meet domestic demand, export demand continued strong and pricing has been moving up nicely, as I\u2019ll detail. We didn\u2019t take any brown containerboard economic downtime in the quarter, but we did take 4,000 tons of bleach footboard downtime in our Canadian mill. We took major maintenance downtime totaling 27,000 tons in the quarter, as we took action this year to adjust our maintenance outage schedule to better match seasonal demand.", "Also, as I mentioned, we made substantial progress recovering the fall containerboard and box price increases. By the end of the month of December, we had recovered approximately $40 per ton in domestic box prices, although the average for the quarter was about $29 per ton over the September quarter average. With the year-end contractual adjustments I referred to on our last quarter\u2019s call taking hold this month, we believe we\u2019ll have recovered about $51 per ton by the end of January. That recovery will represent the vast majority of our expected total recovery from this price increase, although over the next few quarters, we expect to realize some further contractual increases as well take advantage of opportunities either to further improve the pricing of our base of business or the margin mix of our domestic box business.", "Turning to exports, as I mentioned, export demand for containerboard continued to hold up across the quarter, and pricing has been recovering nicely. Our containerboard exports were 203,000 tons. They were down 18% for the preceding quarter, but pricing was up. On average, for containerboard only, about $40 a ton over the September quarter, although pulp pricing was up less.", "For shipments in the March quarter, we expect pricing to continue to increase in all of our markets. And while pricing to the Middle East has also improved from its 2012 bottom, we\u2019ve curtailed shipments to that region to meet our internal system demand and demand in other higher-value domestic and export markets.", "Pulp pricing began to improve in the last few months as well and we expected overall, including our SPSK pulp, our pulp pricing should be approximately $18 per ton higher in the March quarter than in the December quarter.", "In addition to the improving market conditions and pricing I have discussed, the new leadership team we put in place last summer in our Corrugated businesses is really having a major impact on improving our operating performance. We\u2019ve made good progress at Hodge, with operating income up $12 million over the prior quarter. We took outages on both machines in December and January to correct some of the engineering design efficiencies discussed in our last call. We\u2019ve seen particular improvement on the number 4 machine but we will implement other corrections in the spring, major maintenance outages, and those will have the greatest effect on the larger number 5 machine.", "These steps will enable substantial further earnings improvement over the course of this year, and the new Corrugated leaders are also making solid progress improving our sales performance, volume as I\u2019ve mentioned, and with respect to absolute pricing of new business and selling business that best suits our operations.", "And with regard to Hopewell, as I mentioned, we made the decision last year to reduce the complexity of that project by splitting the work over two years, and the first part will be completed in this spring\u2019s outage, with remainder during the 2014 outage.", "Turning to our Consumer segment, demand was relatively weaker than we expected during the second half of the quarter, after a strong first half of the quarter. Segment sales of $611 million were down 1.5% from the prior-year quarter, and segment earnings were down $14 million over the prior-year quarter. Continued weakness in global demand for bleach paperboard is the largest issue in the current business climate.", "Full-year industry operating rates for domestic SPS production were reported to be 92.9%, which was down slightly from 93.3% in 2011. Although coated recycled paperboard mill operating rates remain healthy, they were reported at 94.6% for the full year. Folding carton pricing continues to be under pressure.", "Seasonal demand for folding cartons typically recovers more quickly after the New Year than demand for corrugated packaging, so we\u2019re seeing better sales results month to-date in January, and we expect to see better sales results in the March quarter throughout the segment. Although segment income will be reduced by the major maintenance outage, we\u2019ll take it to the Demopolis Bleached Board Mill during the month of March, which I\u2019ll say more about.", "Turning to our Recycling segment, major changes we made last summer in the leadership and organizational structure of this segment are also having an important impact. We had a $7 million improvement in Recycling segment operating income over the preceding quarter, which is primarily a result of cost structure and margin improvements in the segment. The new team is also building a more profitable market presence based on the Rock-Tenn trading model that I believe will show continued earnings improvement as the actions of this team have more time to take hold.", "Looking forward to the March quarter and the balance of the year, the business environment overall is encouraging. Domestic boxing containerboard demand is good for this, our weaker sales quarter. Export demand is solid, and export pricing continues to improve. And recycled fiber and natural gas costs, while higher than the December quarter, are still relatively favor in the context of a broader time horizon. OCC for January was flat to December to $100 per ton for our blended average of the regional indices and the 12-month natural gas trip of $3.77 per MMBtu is really quite favorable for us given our large recycle position in both containerboard and paperboard.", "Last quarter, we forecast full-year 2013 free cash flow available for debt repayment, dividends and pension contributions in excess of expense in the range of $650 to $675 million or $9 per share.", "Today, based on our improving performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we believe that free cash flow for such purposes will be higher or in the range of $700 million in aggregate.", "Now, as you know, we manage our business to generate long-term free cash flow, but we recognize the reality that most analysts who covers published quarterly EPS reasons, for that reason, the last quarter, we stressed that adjusted earnings per share in the March quarter would be much lower than the September and December quarters due to a number of factors, including the fact that we\u2019ve moved our outage schedule to better match our seasonal demand and it will take the largest amount of outage downtime in the March quarter. 131,000 tons in total is our current estimate for the March quarter.", "We believe that these actions we\u2019ve taken have increased the seasonality of our March quarterly earnings to an extent that\u2019s not fully captured in the published consensus or necessarily comparable to our public peers. While Steve will detail a number of specific cost items in his comments, there are four operating factors you should be aware of that will affect March quarter earnings.", "First, we pay the employer payroll tax that gets collected mostly in the March quarter. Those payroll taxes will reduce March quarter earnings from December quarter earnings by about $0.15 per share and about $0.05 per share in the June quarter.", "Second, the Demopolis bleached board mill outage, which we will take in March, is actually a long and expensive outage much more so than the normal because we\u2019re doing a significant amount of recovery boiler work and that outage will reduce production in the quarter beyond our normal biannual pattern and reduce earnings by about $0.08 to $0.10 per share.", "Thirdly, the new team we put in place is intently focused on improving the reliability of our virgin containerboard mills, and as part of that effort, we anticipate incurring maintenance expenses in the March and June quarters that will subtract about $0.05 per share from the earnings each quarter from the earnings you would otherwise have expected.", "Then lastly, as I think we\u2019ve detailed in another call, the March quarter has two less production days than the December quarter this year which for us equates to about 40,000 tons of production or about $0.05 per share compared to the December quarter. And as you know, given the sensitivity of our quarterly earnings to cost input and monthly sales volumes, we\u2019re very reluctant to forecast quarterly earnings per share, but given the mentioned \u2013 factors I mentioned above, I think it\u2019s worth noting that we expect March quarter\u2019s earnings to be in the range of $1 share. However, this doesn\u2019t detract from our very positive view with respect to the balance of the year as we expect third and fourth quarter earnings to trend up sharply thereafter. And as I\u2019ve stated, we\u2019ve increased our full-year cash flow view to approximately $9.50 to $9.75 per share.", "Finally, I\u2019d like to comment on the change that most of you have likely seen where the EPA published its final Boiler MACT rule. There are a number of changes in the final rule that will reduce our expected compliance costs significantly. While we\u2019re at an early stage of the engineering work that will refine our compliance solutions, we believe that the changes in the final rule will reduce our expected capital expenditures to about $100 million or roughly half of the $200 million that we estimated in our last few 10-Ks. In addition, the final rule established the new three-year compliance period, so we expect that we\u2019ll spend most of this capital in fiscal 2015 and 2016.", "Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Steve to go over some financial specifics. Steve?", "Steve Voorhees", "Thanks, Jim. At the end of December, Rock-Tenn\u2019s net debt was $3.2 billion. Credit agreement EBITDA was $1.2 billion, and our leverage ratio was 2.77 times as compared to our covenant of 3.75 times. Liquidity was up $1.1 million at the end of the quarter.", "In December, we refinanced our accounts receivable facility, extending the maturity of the facility to December 2015. We\u2019ve reduced drawn pricing from a margin of 110 basis points to 75 basis points over short-term rates. This has created 35 basis points in interest rate savings. Due to the good credit quality in our accounts receivable portfolio, we improved the borrowing base definitions, which provided approximately $150 million in incremental borrowing availability. We use this additional liquidity to prepay the next eight scheduled bank term loan amortization payments though December 2014 at a savings of approximately 100 basis points. All totaled, the refinancing will reduce our interest cost by approximately $3 million per year.", "Our next scheduled term loan amortization payment is in March 2015. Rock-Tenn\u2019s only significant debt due over the next 12 months is the $80 million, and that\u2019s maturing in March of this year. We expect to repay these notes using our existing borrowing sources. Our balance sheet and liquidity continue to be in excellent shape.", "We continue to make good progress on our integration during the December quarter. We\u2019re heavily engaged in converting the acquired box plants to a standard operating system, and we expect to complete the installation across our box plant system during fiscal year 2014. We continue to focus on box plant operating improvements. We\u2019ve closed 15 box plants and realized cost savings and customer retention rates that are meeting our goals. We\u2019re also in the process of closing seven recycling facilities as we implement the Rock-Tenn business model, which is focused on serving our mills and customers within a cost structure that producers above cost to capital returns.", "The natural gas lines that will reduce fuel consumption at four containerboard mills have all been completed. These projects reduced our cost by $6 million in the December quarter. Our savings will increase through this summer, as we complete various maintenance outage and capital projects that by the end of this fiscal year, will enable us to achieve a full annual run rate of cost savings through a reduced fuel oil consumption of $45 million.", "As of December 31, our run rate of achieved synergies and performance improvements was in excess of $300 million. Approximately 54% of this is in administrative areas, procurement, and energy. Approximately 25% is in the mills, and 21% is in the box plants and other operational areas.", "We continue to believe that we will achieve in fiscal 2014 the $550 million run rate in synergies and performance improvements that we forecast shortly following the acquisition. We\u2019ve refined and modified our plants. In particular, we\u2019ve shelved one major containerboard mill expansion project that would\u2019ve created 145,000 tons of additional capacity. And we\u2019ve moved the Hopewell expansion into the 2014 outage.", "We\u2019ve identified other lower cost or lower-risk opportunities of at least equal aggregate value. Cash restructuring costs for plant closures, acquisition and integration expenses were $13 million during the first quarter and $92 million over the past 18 months since the acquisition date. Over the same 18 months, we received $44 million in cash proceeds from the sale of real estate and equivalent. The net cash cost of $48 million are much better than our initial expectations, and consequently have had a positive impact on our cash flow over the past 18 months.", "Turning to our key cost inputs, wood fiber cost increased sequentially by $9 million and energy costs increased by $4 million. These cost increases were offset by a $14 million decline in the cost of recovered fiber. Market prices for recovered fiber reached a low point in the September quarter and increased in December as we expected.", "Our recycled fiber composite index averaged $92 per ton during the quarter, basically the same as the September quarter. Prices during the month of December were $100 per ton and were flat in January, and we expect some upward trend from here.", "Natural gas prices continue to be very attractive. 12-month prices are approximately $3.57 per MMBtu. As Jim said, the12-month strip of approximately $3.77 per MMBtu is attractive and \u2013 but does compare to the average price of $3.40 in the December quarter.", "Turning to our guidance for certain financial statistics, we estimate that our depreciation and amortization for the year will be $565 million. We expect corporate cost of $25 million through the second quarter and between $95 million and $100 million for the fiscal year. We estimate interest expense of $110 million for the year and $28 million for the March quarter.", "Rock-Tenn\u2019s book tax rate for the December quarter was 38.7%. This was higher than we expected due to a re-measurement of deferred taxes required as a result of tax legislation enacted in California during the first quarter. We expect our book tax rate for fiscal year 2013 to trend between 37% and 38% as the impact of the Federal tax legislation enacted in early January are recognized. Of course, we do not expect to pay any cash Federal taxes due to our tax position, which I\u2019ll detail and the re-enactment of bonus depreciation for 2013.", "At December 31, recorded unused tax items that will provide a total cash benefit of approximately $355 million and reduced future Federal cash taxes. $129 million of this benefit will be from the use of Federal net operating losses during fiscal years 2013 and 2014. The remaining $226 million benefit will be from the use of cellulosic biofuel, alternative minimum tax, and other Federal tax credits over the next two to three years, the actual timing depending on our taxable income.", "These tax items exclude the unrecorded asset related to additional Federal net operating losses, that will be available at the Smurfit-Stone Black Liquor tax credits, claimed as an excise tax credit, proved to be nontaxable. In such a case, the cash benefit of our unused tax items will increase by $227 million to a total of $582 million.", "We\u2019re currently estimating total required cash pension plan contributions of $186 million in fiscal year 2013. We expect to contribute $38 million to our pension plans in the March quarter. In 2013, we expect pension expense for qualified plans of about $30 million for the full year and pension funding in excess of expense will be $156 million.", "We estimate that the expenses related to deferred outage cost for the containerboard and bleached paperboard mills will be $93 million in FY 2013, as outlined on the table on page 16.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Jim and I are now available to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Are you ready to take questions at this time?", "Steve Voorhees", "Yes, we are.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Please standby for the first question. The first question is from Mark Weintraub.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Jim Rubright", "Hi, Mark.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "The increase in the free cash flow for the full year, is that a function of you getting the pricing in through better than you had anticipated, better operations, lower costs or something else?", "Jim Rubright", "I think it\u2019s a little all of the above, Mark. But I think where \u2013 my view is primarily based on strength in demand and strength in pricing, as well as somewhat more favorable view with respect to the full-year OCC costs. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s the demand environment, cost environment looking particularly at OCC, which hasn\u2019t increased at the rate that we had internally forecast, and then I think our operations are showing improvements, particularly on the reliability side.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Okay, great. And then lastly, on the CapEx, I saw you took the low end of the range down some. Is that you\u2019re spending more effectively? Did you reduce some projects or is that the Boiler MACT rules?", "Jim Rubright", "It is not Boiler MACT. It was just a refinement of the timing of the execution of projects as we move through the year.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Okay. And you remain confident that you can get the synergy and the profit improvement goals that you\u2019ve outlined with the amount of spend that you previously talked about over the next couple of years, is that a fair statement?", "Jim Rubright", "Yes.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Okay. Terrific. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Phil Gresh.", "Phil Gresh \u2013 JP Morgan", "Hey, good morning.", "Jim Rubright", "Hey, Phil.", "Phil Gresh \u2013 JP Morgan", "Just on the March quarter, thank you for the color on the moving pieces there. If you add them up, it\u2019s basically the $0.35 going from the $1.35 to the $1. I guess I would have thought maybe there would be a few positive offsets like the fact that the Corrugated pricing is still flowing through, you still have synergy run rate improving. So I just wanted to understand how the rest of the pieces, shouldn\u2019t they be somewhat positive? Do you feel like you\u2019re being conservative on the numbers or am I missing something?", "Jim Rubright", "Well, what I didn\u2019t detail was the seasonal effects of fiber cost. We had a very wet winter in the south and then you\u2019re in the winter season. So you\u2019re going to see several signs of adverse comparison to the December quarter on virgin fiber, which is a seasonal effect. And then recycled fiber, just the January price is up $8 a ton over the December quarter average and we expect that to go up a little bit more. So you\u2019ve got $0.10 plus or minus on recycled fiber if we\u2019re right. If there\u2019s upside in our forecast, I think one place could possibly be recycled fiber, but we are making an assumption that it will increase in February and March, so that those are the principal areas, I think.", "If you\u2019re looking for upside, if consumer demand strengthens particularly. I think the upside over the balance of the year, a little bit in the quarter from demand would also come in the Consumer segment, but seasonal cost factors are going to mute the effect of the price increase which we\u2019ve indicated what we recover in the March quarter and then, once you get into the June and September quarters, as you move through the outage season and into an environment in which you\u2019ve got more favorable cost factors that are seasonal, your earnings then just snap back up.", "Phil Gresh \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay thanks. And then, Jim, just on inventories, obviously you built some inventory here in the quarter that are planned for the maintenance. But maybe you could just talk a little bit about how you\u2019re thinking about the inventory levels across your system longer term and you\u2019ve talked about operating at a very tight level. So how are you thinking about that longer term?", "Jim Rubright", "The inventory build that we\u2019ve built will peak at about 95,000 tons in the month of January. As I mentioned, these 131,000 total tons include 14,000 tons of Demopolis. So I think the total system outages for containerboards are 117,000 tons in the March quarter, but given the fact that we\u2019ll have 70,000 tons of downtime in the June quarter, you\u2019ll see us run that inventory down in the June quarter, not the March quarter.", "So then you get into the September quarter and basically at the end of the September quarter, you sort of reset your inventory levels. And we\u2019ve talked about the fact that we would like to operate our system with somewhat more inventory than we\u2019ve been able to manage to over the last two years. I think that\u2019s totally \u2013 in total about 40,000 tons.", "So if we\u2019re successful in achieving the performance and reliability improvements that we\u2019ve described, we\u2019ll end this September with about 40,000 tons of containerboard in our system in excess of what we had last September. We balance the public perception of inventory levels versus the cost of operating our system and we come out at that being about the right increase for us. Our full year cash flow numbers, therefore, are reflecting the fact that we\u2019re building in an inventory cost that\u2019s associated with an incremental 40,000 tons of inventory over the course of the fiscal year.", "Phil Gresh \u2013 JP Morgan", "Got it. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a last question is just how you\u2019re thinking about the improvements at Hodge moving forward. I think you expected a pause this quarter, as you work through the downtime, and then some improvement in the back half. So maybe just talk about where you feel you were this quarter relative to what you thought, and then how you see that progressing over the next couple of quarters?", "Jim Rubright", "I didn\u2019t expect to see much improvement over the course of the December quarter until we completed the outages that we did middle of December on 4 and early January on 5. But in fact, they increased their average production in the month of December by over 200 tons per day from the average of October and November. So actually they made significant progress. And I looked at the daily report for yesterday and they had the highest production that they\u2019ve had since the outage. So the team is doing a very good job.", "But there are some structural issues associated with five, I won\u2019t go into the specific detail but it really won\u2019t be corrected until the outage, which will be early in our third fiscal quarter. So, while I think you\u2019ll see some incremental improvement and some reliability improvements, I think the major next change from the levels we\u2019ve achieved at the end of December will be in the second \u2013 in our third fiscal quarter, which is when we complete that outage.", "But nonetheless, the team has done a very good job and Hodge is moving along, and again, another potential upside would be some increased earnings from Hodge before what we\u2019re estimating in the March quarter. But I want to go back to one other factor because when you look at the seasonality of the March quarter earnings, it is surprising why it is so much. And in fact, the timing of our outage is not only increase the tons, but our two most profitable mills go down for outages in the March quarter. They\u2019re very large, very profitable mills. And so the loss contribution relative to the total loss contribution over the course of the outage season is maximized in the quarter in which those two go down. And again, I mean, if I was trying to manage earnings, I wouldn\u2019t have done that, but I\u2019m trying to manage cash flow and it\u2019s the right thing to do for the company.", "Phil Gresh \u2013 JP Morgan", "Understood. Thanks, I\u2019ll turn it over.", "Operator", "The next question is from George Staphos.", "George Staphos \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, everyone. Good morning. I had a couple of questions on cash flow realizing that there are not going to be any Federal taxes paid, Steve, do you have a view on what we should be penciling in for other taxes in terms of how you ultimately get to your $700 million free cash flow available for debt, pension and dividend? And similarly, Jim, you\u2019re mentioning the working capital that you\u2019re building in directionally for the forecast. If you\u2019re in our seats, how much would you be building in for working capital as a cash usage this year?", "Jim Rubright", "Hi, George, the taxes other than Federal would be somewhere around...", "George Staphos \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Yeah.", "Jim Rubright", "$10 million.", "George Staphos \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "Jim Rubright", "For the working capital, we \u2013 if you look at AR, inventory loss AP, we hover between 45 and 50 days, just think for the forecast there, if you can do that they\u2019ll be some like inventory went up on a day\u2019s basis, this past quarter AR went down a little bit, but that\u2019s pretty much what we experience as far as changes in working capital. I think that\u2019s responsive to your question. Did I miss something?", "George Staphos \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "No, I guess that\u2019s it. We\u2019ll back into what that means from a working capital cash usage offline. Are there any other large cash flow items we should be mindful of as we\u2019re developing our own forecast relative to your guidance? You\u2019ve already given us CapEx and pension, we have that, but anything else that we should be mindful that you haven\u2019t called out specifically?", "Jim Rubright", "I don\u2019t think so.", "George Staphos \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks for that. Next question I had, you mentioned that there\u2019s one project now that you\u2019re not going to be going ahead with on the mill side, that I think Jim you said was going to be roughly around 145,000 tons of incremental tonnage. Would that then take the goal, maybe it used to be 600,000 tons to more like 450,000 tons of improved productivity and I\u2019ll stop there and ask a couple of follow-ons?", "Jim Rubright", "Yes, but let me go back through and detail that because the 550,000 to 600,000 tons was basically the initial target and of that, remember the first 200,000 we\u2019ve achieved through the actual 150,000 that we\u2019ve brought on and the change in the mix at Hodge which reduced that goal by 40,000 to 50,000 tons by substantially increasing lightweight production there versus the original, what I\u2019m going to refer to as the Smurfit footprint plan. So, yes, in the interim, basically in the last 24 months, several things have happened. First one is the economy hasn\u2019t grown and as a result of the fact that I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to make any change in sort of the political agenda in Washington, it\u2019s hard to expect the economy to grow significantly.", "Secondly, our businesses have performed very well in a constrained capacity environment. And then, with respect to the existing mills, we\u2019ve really done a good job and have some things that are in place that are reducing the cost of the capacity that we otherwise would have displaced with incremental capacity addition. So it changes the economics of the project that I\u2019ve mentioned, that we\u2019ve cancelled. And it was also causing us to look very closely at the economics of what\u2019s left on the table because the additional capacity that we\u2019ve always talked about bringing on, always was intended to displace higher cost capacity. So if you reduce the cost of the capacity we\u2019re going to displace, you then affect those economics.", "So I think that we\u2019ll be very careful with respect to any net capacity additions relative to our system, and the team we\u2019ve got in place is much more focused on cost reduction opportunities. So therefore, while I think that we\u2019ll meet or exceed the synergy target and performance improvement target that we\u2019ve indicated, I think there\u2019ll be a mix change and a greater focus on cost reduction particularly given my view that the economy is not likely to grow in the next 12 to 24 months in an accelerating rate and our view that we need to be extremely careful with respect to the capacity balance in the containerboard segment, which is obviously driving significant value for us.", "George Staphos \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "It\u2019s a fair point, it\u2019s nice to see the improved progress. I guess the related question I had is there are some new, and in case, larger machines coming on stream that could affect some of your mills in terms of fiber basket and potential demand. Again, if you were in our seat, how would you guys think about how that those machines might impact your markets for your fiber costs over the next 12 months?", "Jim Rubright", "If you assume that the market has some capacity creep up, it\u2019s hard to say whether that additional capacity will be absorbed or not, it\u2019s also a little hard to predict what the actions of the particular party adding that capacity will be with its existing base of supply. So I can\u2019t predict with certainty how much of an impact it\u2019ll have. We\u2019ve seen an impact on fiber cost in the New York and sort of upper northeastern region already, as they line up for fiber supply. So I don\u2019t think \u2013 well, I think it\u2019s been adverse. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be much more materially adverse from what we have seen.", "George Staphos \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Got you. Last quick one, and I\u2019ll turn it over. One slide nine, where would I find the incremental performance improvement of synergy benefit to Corrugated\u2019s EBITDA bridge? I know some of it\u2019s being offset by wage inflation and so on, but where would I find that in those bars? Thanks, guys. Good luck in the quarter.", "Jim Rubright", "George, it\u2019s Jim. Many of the categories, I think, there\u2019s mostly in the last bar, which the other\u2019s A minus, we\u2019ve call it out $16 million, in the footnote as deferred average cost.", "George Staphos \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Right.", "Jim Rubright", "The other negatives contributing to that would be some maintenance and replacement, which is about $4 million. Freight, which should be a broad definition of slate to include warehousing and were negatively impacted by higher rail rates this time, and around about $6 million in other, which is primarily higher SG&A cost, I think the synergies would be kind of netted in there that would be an offset to higher labor cost, I mean, in general cost increases in the areas which are not otherwise identified in the area in the chart.", "George Staphos \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Okay. All right. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll turn it over", "Operator", "The next question is from Mark Wilde.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Good morning. I wondered Jim, if you could talk a little bit about the weakness that you had highlighted in Consumer Packaging. You mentioned both some weaknesses in board pricing and weaknesses in the carton pricing and I wondered if you could kind of break those two out for us and whether you think there is kind of an ongoing impact for maybe carton contracts resetting at lower levels?", "Jim Rubright", "Well, the underlying problem as I mentioned is the global supply of SPS and then that backs up throughout the grades and with respect to \u2013 and you\u2019ve seeing another $20 ton decrease in SPS, so if I\u2019m correct, we\u2019ve got a total published index decline of $60 a ton in SPS pricing. I think the psychology of contract negotiations are you\u2019re either in the strong board market where converters have an opportunity to increase pricing here and a weak board market which puts the changes of psychology and tends to put pressure on the negotiations. We happen to be in the latter phase right now.", "It\u2019s unfortunate because SPS is only one of three grades, and I think supply for certainly CRB is strong, so I think absent the SPS effects where it can create some tightness in that market, particularly domestically. You could reverse the psychology but currently, we\u2019re on the other side of that cycle right now.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay and then just (inaudible), is that all that\u2019s going on in terms of lower carton prices or has the carton market become a bit more competitive as well?", "Jim Rubright", "I think as what I said Mark, I think it\u2019s a function of the board market.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay and then just in terms of, coming back to George\u2019s question, in terms of some of these deferrals or cancellations on mill improvement projects and containerboard, can you just walk us through in addition to Hodge and Hopewell, what else sits out there for you now. I think it, at one point, there was a project down in Florence. I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s the project that you\u2019ve cancelled, but if you could just walk us through what else is going to go on across your system over the next two or three years in terms of capital?", "Jim Rubright", "No. Mark, if I was going to try to walk through capital in the mill system for the next three years, we\u2019d be on the phone for a long time.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "I was just really interested in sort of the major projects that would have added significant capacity.", "Jim Rubright", "Well, there were three projects that were significant relative to their total capacity, one we\u2019ve done at Hodge, the other is Hopewell, and another one which we\u2019ve unspecified with respect to the mill we\u2019ve indicated we\u2019ve canceled. So those were the three major projects. The remainder of the capacity increase is really a function of a broad variety of smaller capital projects and rationalizations and bottleneck, debottlenecking across the entire mill system, and so none of them would fit the category of a major project.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then just one other question on fiber cost, you touched on OCC kind of up around the Solvay Mill, I think with that new machine starting up in Niagara Falls. I know that there\u2019s a company that seems to be producing recycled containerboard down in Georgia right now. I wonder if that\u2019s had any effect on kind of southeast OCC. And then finally, if you could just talk about what you\u2019re seeing in pulpwood cost in the southeast, particularly with some more of these pellet plants being announced?", "Jim Rubright", "Yes. Well, the first one with respect to recycled fiber in the southeast, no, there really hasn\u2019t been an overall change in the market demand. And I \u2013 so I don\u2019t see a significant effect there.", "Number two, with respect to fiber costs, virgin fiber costs in the south, they\u2019re higher so far this year than we had budgeted, and I think the wetness of the season which had been referred to by others is a driver of those costs. I think that will ultimately come back as we move through the spring and into the summer, assuming we have normal weather patterns. And Mark, was there a third part of your question?", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "No, I think that you\u2019ve got it. Good luck in the coming quarters.", "Jim Rubright", "Good. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question is from Anthony Pettinari.", "Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citigroup", "Good morning. You talked about the timeline for major projects in the mills and where you are there. And I\u2019m wondering when you look at the box plant side, can you tell us kind of what inning you are in, in terms of realizing the footprint changes that are desirable there? Is your integration rate or export mix going to change? And then, Steve I think referenced the conversion to a new planning and costing system, I believe this is going to complete in 2014. Do you get the benefits of that when the switch is flipped in 2014 or is that something where you\u2019re getting benefits flowing through improve quarter-by-quarter?", "Jim Rubright", "Right. I\u2019ll take the last question first. There is some sort of incremental benefit as you obtain the visibility of data out of the system as you start moving across the regions as you implement the system, but it\u2019s small relative to the impact of the cost structure changes you can effect when you no longer support six procure-to-pay systems in a box plant system, and you can centralize a number of accounting and other finance functions. So you have \u2013 when that project is completed in 2014, you\u2019ll be able to make some a number of organizational and structural and functional changes that will give you the benefit of that project. So it is largely not incremental. So let\u2019s go \u2013 that\u2019s the first question. Let\u2019s go back to your other questions, if you don\u2019t mind restating them.", "Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citigroup", "Sure. Sure. I mean when you look at the box plant side, where are we in terms of realizing sort of the footprint changes?", "Jim Rubright", "That\u2019s a good question. As you know, we\u2019ve announced 15 box plant closures and I\u2019ll just comment, those were essentially three \u2013 moving our box plant system to a system that has larger average capacity. So the average \u2013 those were like less than 400 million square foot a year plants on average, and we\u2019re trying to move to a model where we\u2019re 1.3 billion square feet to 1.6 billion square feet on average for the heart of our box plant.", "So those were important closures. As we look at our box plant system today, we see much more opportunity for improving the overall cost structure of the system than we would have 12 months ago or 18 months ago. And some of its capital related, but it\u2019s not really a footprint change in the main. It\u2019s really an equipping change to modernize the equipment in the plant, change the plant functionality and footprint or functionality. So some of the capital that I would otherwise have expected to have put into mill expansions, will drive into the box plant system. But it\u2019s not so much footprint as it is simply enabling pretty significant cost reductions in the converting cost system in our \u2013 across Rock-Tenn.", "Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay. That\u2019s.....", "Jim Rubright", "And I\u2019d say we\u2019re very early days there relative to the re-equipping of the basic box plant system.", "Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And I guess just final question, as you look towards maybe the end of 2014, would you anticipate that that footprint change would meaningfully change your integration rates or your mix towards exports versus the domestic market or maybe your balance of exposure between big national accounts and local accounts. Can you give us sort of any color there?", "Jim Rubright", "Yeah. Certainly, the experience we have in our consumer business, where we dramatically reduced the footprint and cost of our folding carton system really without the intention of providing a basis for growth, but really just to right size the asset base and get the cost structure right, resulted in growth, and I think, you\u2019ve seen that in one of our competitors. So the possibility of growth in converting sales is certainly there, but all other changes are essentially justified on the assumption that they\u2019re cost based and not incremental sales based.", "So with respect to our plans, we\u2019re building them on the basis that we maintain the level of integration that we have rather than increase it, with respect to the specific investments I\u2019m talking about.", "Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay. I\u2019ll turn it over.", "Operator", "The next question is from Mark Connelly.", "Mark Connelly \u2013 Credit Agricole", "Thanks. Just two things, Jim. First, it sounds like from what you\u2019re saying and what we\u2019re hearing elsewhere that most of the improvement in the export market is because of reduced supply. Can you give us a sense of what you\u2019re seeing on the demand side in the export market? And secondarily, just to get this over with, other producers are talking about greater than normal winter seasonality, but I don\u2019t really hear you saying that, am I right in that?", "Jim Rubright", "Well, with respect to the second question, in our scale, the factors are things that we have done that create the seasonality. Within \u2013 if you just look at the weather conditions for example, yes, I would think that you have a wetter winter than normal in the southeast and possibly some more pressure. And as I indicated, I think our fiber costs are ahead of our expectations and is that seasonal?", "Mark Connelly \u2013 Credit Agricole", "Okay.", "Jim Rubright", "I think likely yes, but relative to scale of the changes we\u2019ve talked about, it\u2019s in terms of just the quarterly impact on earnings, it\u2019s smaller for us possibly than some of the competitors.", "Mark Connelly \u2013 Credit Agricole", "Sure.", "Jim Rubright", "And that\u2019s basically \u2013 that might explain the focus and again Mark, I apologize, ask me your first question again.", "Mark Connelly \u2013 Credit Agricole", "Sure. The question is on the export market. All we\u2019re hearing about is withdrawal of supply, but I\u2019m just curious what you think is really helping the demand?", "Jim Rubright", "Well, demand was never really the problem. I felt \u2013 now you have to dial back over a year, but when you get into November and December when the European disarray of their economy really occurred, we had some companies really tear up pricing in the export market. And so you just had an \u2013 a significant decline in export containerboard prices that was not in my mind, a function of export demand. And as we\u2019ve said all through last year, we thought demand was fine. We just \u2013 it just takes a while to get pricing up, but if you think of where they are from the bottom, you\u2019ve got more than $70 a ton in Central America, significant increases in Europe and Asia, but the demand environment has always been okay.", "And right now, the demand is strong and I think certainly, we cut back on export volumes as a result of internal system demand, so I\u2019m not arguing with the fact that you probably had constraint. And Mark, look at the differential between recycled and virgin containerboard costs in Europe.", "Mark Connelly \u2013 Credit Agricole", "All right.", "Jim Rubright", "It\u2019s a huge disparity, which says virgin is clearly short in Europe and that\u2019s what we export. So I would say the demand environment likely is strengthening, but I think the bigger impact on pricing is simply a recovery from a very adverse circumstance that developed over a year ago as a result of what was going on Europe.", "Mark Connelly \u2013 Credit Agricole", "Right. Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "The next question is from Alex Ovshey.", "Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thanks. Good morning, guys.", "Jim Rubright", "Good morning.", "Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "I think you talked about the improvement in demand on the CRB side driven by number of the food end markets that you have exposure too. And on the containerboard side, it doesn\u2019t seem like we\u2019re getting the same type of pull-through on the demand side. I\u2019m just curious it appears to me that corrugated recycled board and containerboard have similar end markets, so what would be the disconnect between why it appears demand trends are picking up more on the CRB side versus containerboard?", "Jim Rubright", "Over time, our experience has been that folding carton demand picks up more quickly in January and February than corrugated demand does. Similarly, we have more seasonality with respect to folding cartons in December than you do with containerboard. Now, I cannot explain that. It just is, and it is a pattern and it recurs.", "Now, what I said in my comments was we were very surprised by the deep weakness in consumer packaging demand, and you\u2019re equating that to CRB, which is ultimately accurate at CRB and SBS, I don\u2019t know where the demand went, to be honest with you, but it went somewhere in December and it has come back very strongly in January. But these are very, very short-term effects. They\u2019re not really changes in long-term supply and demand dynamics with respect to it. CRB, If you look over longer term, CRB is high.", "Nobody imports CRB into the United States, nobody exports it. So, it\u2019s pretty much a closed market, and it\u2019s a very sustainable product for which there\u2019s very stable demand. So that, I think that explains the difference in where CRB is relative to other grades of paperboard. In Corrugated, we\u2019ve seen normal \u2013 or containerboard, we\u2019ve seen normal seasonal patterns except that the demand, as we\u2019ve said across the December quarter and into the January quarter, have simply been stronger.", "Why? I don\u2019t know, but we\u2019re satisfied with the demand characteristics in the containerboard market, but they\u2019re more stable than \u2013 on a seasonal basis than we would have expected.", "Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thank you, Jim. And then can you tell us what your total production of containerboard was in the December quarter? And then what the change in the inventory was, if you compare the December quarter of 2012 versus December quarter of 2011 on a year-over-year basis?", "Jim Rubright", "Right, let us just get back to that. I mean, we\u2019ll be flipping books, looking for exact tonnages and just, if you don\u2019t mind just follow up with John and he can give you the exact specifics.", "Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, no problem, Jim. And just one last thing. In terms of thinking about the cost of the downtime in the containerboard business, is there a rule of thumb that you can put out there to help us think about what the cost to downtime would be?", "Jim Rubright", "From a competitive standpoint, I\u2019d rather not and it really depends a little bit on the mix of mills and whether you\u2019re looking at variable cost, but I think you could take the impact that we\u2019ve indicated and then just extrapolate that over the expected downtime, and as I said, it\u2019s 117,000 tons containerboard in the second quarter.", "Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thanks, Jim.", "Operator", "The next question is from Philip Ng.", "Phil Ng \u2013 Jefferies", "Good morning. Good morning, guys. Hey, Jim, if I heard you correctly, it sounded you were generally a little more upbeat about the demand profile for containerboard both on the export side and domestically. I know you guys built some inventory in January, but we\u2019re heading into very peak downtime periods. So when I think about that going forward, is there any risk that supply could get pretty tight like on the September-October timeframe in a hurry?", "Jim Rubright", "September and October is pretty far out. I think that what we\u2019re experiencing right now is a pretty tight marketplace. I think supply and demand in containerboard is in pretty good balance, and it did get tight last year. So I wouldn\u2019t expect that fundamental to change, but it\u2019s a little far out for me to forecast within that degree.", "Phil Ng \u2013 Jefferies", "Well, I was referring September and October of last year it got really tight in a hurry. So I\u2019m just saying with the downtime you guys are taking rest of an industry, is there any concerns that I could get that tight relatively quickly, because you sounded a little more upbeat about demand.", "Jim Rubright", "Well, I don\u2019t know what other people\u2019s plans are with respect to downtime precisely and gauging short-term demand fluctuations is hard. But I think the markets are generally in relatively tight balance, and all I can tell you is that our external demand and the demand that our external customers foresee for us is stronger than we would have expected on a seasonal basis, and we\u2019ve shown our volumes increasing. So I think the current snugness or tightness in the market is likely to continue.", "Phil Ng \u2013 Jefferies", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then I think you\u2019ve \u2013 in the past you guys have highlighted some high-cost capacity you have in containerboard and which won\u2019t change even with some of the changes you\u2019re going to be making on the cost front. Are you going to reassess some of that capacity once you get closer to wrapping up Hodge later this year or is it just more of a 2014 event once you have Hopewell done?", "Jim Rubright", "Well, we got to figure out what we\u2019re going to do with respect to the Hopewell expansion, that\u2019s true, but Hopewell is 120,000 tons. So if you\u2019re really saying, are we going to close a mill, we will not have the need or from our overall cost structure, a desire to close any of the existing containerboard mills, it will be more a balance of the incremental tons across the system from sort of the marginal fiber supply source into the mix that we would look at.", "Phil Ng \u2013 Jefferies", "Okay. And just one last question. I mean, in the last call, you guys gave us some color on what you\u2019re expecting in terms of paperboard and pulp prices in terms of impact, year-over-year impact, I think you guided toward the $60 million headwind. But since then, pulp prices are up a little bit, and SPS prices have fallen. So can you give a sense of where that\u2019s shaking out now in terms of your outlook for 2013?", "Jim Rubright", "No, I don\u2019t have a crystal ball. I think the answer is the SPS is going to be a function of consumer demand, what really the sort of the economic developments in the United States and globally. So if I knew what the demand trends are going to be, I have a better view with respect to SPS. CRB, I think stays relatively tight just because the demand factors that I\u2019ve talked about, but I just don\u2019t have a crystal ball under the ultimate GDP growth over the course of this year, but that will be the driver on the margin for the effects you and I are trying to guess at.", "Phil Ng \u2013 Jefferies", "Okay. All right. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "The next question is from Chip Dillon.", "Jim Rubright", "Hi, Chip.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research", "Hey, good morning. First question is, you mentioned on some of the payroll tax issues, it\u2019s gone up $0.15 in this quarter, and then you said another $0.05 in the June quarter; is that on top of what we see in the March quarter or is that versus the December quarter, that $0.05?", "Jim Rubright", "No, it trends down, because the payroll taxes ultimately get paid based on people\u2019s income. So it\u2019s $0.15 in the March quarter versus December and $0.05 in the June quarter versus December.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research", "Got you. Okay. And then I think Steven mentioned a number I think tied to taxes, $227 million up to $582 million that kind of ran past me. What was that about again?", "Steve Voorhees", "There is an issue with respect to black liquor excise tax, which is not been recognized as income. And if it does get recognized and we get the cash, that\u2019s the $227 million, which is not shown on our financial statements. But in the event we fulfill on that issue, then we would get the balance sort of that NOL over time. And it would be additive to our existing NOL.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research", "Got you. And when do you think though, is that sort of a revenue rolling that you\u2019re waiting for?", "Steve Voorhees", "Well, in fact, it will have to go through a \u2013 because we either have to get a opinion from our accountants that\u2019s more likely than that will prevail income in and audit our returns and agree with the position that we\u2019ve taken that we\u2019re entitled to the balance of that issue.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research", "Got you. And so far, you haven\u2019t claimed that with the IRS so far.", "Steve Voorhees", "We have claimed it.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research", "Oh, you have. I got you. So the cash is already sort of....", "Steve Voorhees", "That\u2019s not the point, I have claimed it. I think it\u2019s an issue which is out there, and if we prevail on that issue, then we\u2019ll get the benefit of that.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research", "Okay. Got you. And then last question is on the \u2013 the last one on taxes. You mentioned, just so I\u2019m clear on the NOLs versus the credits, so obviously credits are dollar-for-dollar, but on the NOLs you mentioned, should we just assume about 35% of that amount is what will be cashed to you in the future as an offset?", "Steve Voorhees", "I think $129 million is what I called out as being the benefit of NOL. That is the cash benefit.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research", "Okay.", "Steve Voorhees", "And operating cost would be grossed up.", "Jim Rubright", "Got you. And then the last question is just from the last quarter, it looks like you\u2019re \u2013 both your pension contribution and the especially the pension \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, the pension expense and the contribution came down a bit from what you had estimated on the last call and I didn\u2019t know if there was \u2013 if that was reflective of anything in the yield curve or what might have resulted in that?", "Steve Voorhees", "We have \u2013 there are some changes in the contribution requirements in Canada, but we selected in the lower contributions.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research", "Okay. In Canada, Okay. And then last question, as you mentioned that you\u2019ve shelved 145,000 ton increment, and could you just remind us what mill that was to take place at?", "Jim Rubright", "We never said where it was going to be. So we\u2019re not saying it now.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research", "Okay. Got you. All right. Thanks, guys. Look forward to see you in February.", "Operator", "The next question is from Steve Chercover.", "Steve Chercover \u2013 DA Davidson", "Thanks. Good morning. First of all, could you please explain the deferred outage expenses that were $16 million in the quarter and I think you said $93 million for the year. Is that an accrual or maybe you can just expand on what it is.", "Steve Voorhees", "We underpaid outages that are containerboard mills and there\u2019s an expense associated with that that we put on the balance sheet when incurred, and then recognized that expense over time. When we did the opening balance sheet accounting for the acquisition, there was no deferred outage expense. And so those were not on the balance sheet at that time. So what\u2019s occurred during this first year is we\u2019ve accumulated those expenses and those are now flowing through the income statement. So they\u2019re a meaningful change on a year-over-year basis, and we\u2019ve tried to call that out for the use of analyst in assessing our income year-over-year.", "Steve Chercover \u2013 DA Davidson", "Okay. And so once we anniversary the acquisition and we\u2019ll kind of stop seeing that.", "Steve Voorhees", "Yeah, we started seeing the change. And then we\u2019ve called out I think on slide 16, the annual rate is $93 million, which is a combination of both Demopolis and the containerboard mills. Demopolis is on the order of $8 million out of the total, so the containerboard piece would be $85 million.", "Jim Rubright", "But I think your point is, once you get to a full run rate, assuming you don\u2019t change the aggregate cost of your maintenance outages, it doesn\u2019t change. And that\u2019s right, the quarterly amortization will be about the same.", "Steve Chercover \u2013 DA Davidson", "Great. Thank you for that clarification. And then one other quick \u2013 I guess a question about a comment, which was that box demand was particularly strong through late December. I mean, that\u2019s terrific color. Do you attribute this to the advent of online shopping or why do you think the seasonality is going away?", "Jim Rubright", "I don\u2019t know if the seasonality is going away. I think we had good demand, and we are seeing good demand in January. It\u2019s across the board, and it\u2019s from external customers and so forth. So I don\u2019t have \u2013 I just don\u2019t have a great explanation.", "Steve Chercover \u2013 DA Davidson", "Well, it\u2019s good news nonetheless. Thank you.", "Jim Rubright", "Yeah.", "Operator", "The next question is from Scott Gaffner.", "Scott Gaffner \u2013 Barclays", "Good morning.", "Jim Rubright", "Good morning.", "Scott Gaffner \u2013 Barclays", "You mentioned the new Corrugated team had found some reliability products that were available and you talked about improving the reliability of the virgin mills specifically. Was there an issue that was found that the new team uncovered, first of all? Second, any cash cost related to this and maybe just some details around those projects, the $0.05 of maintenance expense?", "Jim Rubright", "Well, I mean \u2013 I don\u2019t think it was any secret that the \u2013 or something that one wouldn\u2019t have expected that Smurfit-Stone, which operated under what I would think of is significant cash constraints for a number of years and then went through a bankruptcy. We had expected when we did the acquisition and priced in an expectation that there would be some deferred maintenance capital associated with the mill systems and we had estimated that $100 million in the first year and $50 million in the second year, which we\u2019re \u2013 in our experience, has been consistent with that. But the effect of what I\u2019m going to refer to is the cumulative, let\u2019s say underspending of maintenance spending has \u2013 shows up in reliability.", "In July, we made a material change in not only the senior leadership, but the leadership at various levels throughout the mill system and started building in the infrastructure and the capability simply to assess different and set different expectations with respect to the reliability of the system, and have spent a good bit of time identifying the most important things that we can do to improve the reliability of the system, kind of just placed greater focus on it, that have quantified the effect in the next two quarters which is we think it will be about $0.05 a share in each of the March and June quarters as we implement spending that, although it\u2019s effectively deferred maintenance, it is maintenance spending that will be expensed as a period cost as opposed to capitalized.", "Scott Gaffner \u2013 Barclays", "But these are projects you would have identified at the \u2013 initially when you did the acquisition, but you maybe just didn\u2019t have the management capability to get these projects done sooner. Is that \u2013 am I hearing that correctly?", "Jim Rubright", "Well, it would have been consistent with our expectations of what we would have expected in the mill system, but we wouldn\u2019t have specifically identified what the issues were. We didn\u2019t own the mills, we wouldn\u2019t have had visibility into the specifics of what their needs are. And \u2013 no, I can\u2019t say we would have known the specifics 18 months ago, but we certainly had an expectation that\u2019s consistent with our experience today.", "Scott Gaffner \u2013 Barclays", "And just looking quickly at the synergy run rates, you were at $250 million at the end of the September quarter. Now, you\u2019re saying you\u2019re at $300 million run rate at the end of this \u2013 at the end of December quarter. Is there something that would \u2013 when you say $400 million run rate by the end of the year, is there something as we move through the year that makes the run rate, the incremental run rate quarter-by-quarter start to slow a little bit as we move to the middle of the year. If you stand at $50 million per quarter run rate, you should be above the $400 million.", "Steve Voorhees", "I\u2019m not tracking the $400 million, but we said that last quarter. So right now, we have a broad set of initiatives on the synergies and performance improvements which included the box plants and those systems. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any particular thing which is going to cause the run rate to do much other than accrete from the $300 million plus to the $550 million toward the end of fiscal year 2014. And I think trying to specify a particular goal post for guidelines in any particular quarter, it\u2019s pretty difficult for us to do because there is just so much effort going on in the company.", "Scott Gaffner \u2013 Barclays", "Great. Thanks. Good luck in the quarter.", "Jim Rubright", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Phil Gresh.", "Phil Gresh \u2013 JP Morgan", "Hey, just one follow-up question. Jim, in your prepared remarks you talked about other opportunities to improve your pricing, I believe on your base business. I was just wondering if you could elaborate on that a little bit more, what those opportunities are, are they contractual or how are you thinking about doing that? Thanks.", "Jim Rubright", "Well, Phil, I think I have discussed this in the past, but when we looked at the overall pricing of the Smurfit business once we own the asset, well, we really felt that overall, the pricing was better than what we had expected, the tail or the distribution was troublesome to us. And the poor end of the tail, we weren\u2019t sure what all other reasons for that would\u2019ve been, but to a certain extent it was the lack of the systems that are required to impose discipline on pricing decisions at very local market decisions as well as visibility into pricing and cost that would enable better decision.", "So those are things that we spent an enormous amount of time developing over the last 18 months, not only the visibility into the cost structure at the level of decision-making, you need to understand it, but also imposing the discipline from the top and the guidance on the top to have more efficient pricing. So I think that our view is that we can improve the dispersion at the low end of the overall pricing, and that\u2019s what I was referring to.", "Phil Gresh \u2013 JP Morgan", "Got it. Any way for us to think about what the magnitude of something like that might be?", "Jim Rubright", "I mean, I have some views but I think that it\u2019s better for us just to leave that as part of our belief that we can exceed the $550 million and deliver it.", "Phil Gresh \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay. Understood. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "The next question is from Chip Dillon.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research", "Hi there. Just had a quick follow-up. I know you built 74,000 tons of inventory in the quarter, and then you mentioned something about a high water mark in January being up 95, and maybe I just misunderstood. Does that mean there is an incremental 21,000 tons that you expect to build in January and then it starts to come down?", "Jim Rubright", "Yes.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research", "And so that\u2019s versus September 30?", "Jim Rubright", "Yes.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research", "Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.", "Jim Rubright", "Thank you.", "Operator", "If there are no further questions.

Welcome to the MeadWestvaco Fourth Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Director, Investor Relations, Mr. Jason Thompson. Please go ahead.", "Jason Thompson", "Thanks, Lori, and good morning, everyone. Now this morning, we announced our results before the market opened. A notification of this morning's call was broadly disclosed. Further, this morning's call is being webcast at mwv.com, and slides that accompany this call are available there, too.", "I'll briefly remind you that certain statements we make are forward-looking and are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties described in our public filings. Furthermore, contents contain time-sensitive information that, although correct today, may change with the passage of time.", "All the results we share this morning are presented on a continuing operations basis. For the fourth quarter, the company's income from continuing operations was $17 million, or $0.10 per share. Excluding special items, adjusted net income from continuing operations was $13 million, or $0.07 per share.", "Now here to take you through the results are John Luke, Chairman and CEO; Jim Buzzard, our President; and Mark Rajkowski, CFO.", "Now I'll turn the call over to John.", "John A. Luke", "Thanks, Jason, and good morning. 2012 was a good year for MWV, during which we generated profitable sales growth by successfully implementing our strategies focused on commercial excellence, innovation, growth in emerging markets and expanded participation. These initiatives bolstered our results despite an otherwise difficult fourth quarter in which our overall performance was adversely affected by a dramatic, but temporary, decline in market demand, as well as several one-time items.", "Despite the difficult operating environment in the latter half of the fourth quarter, we grew the top line 4% during 2012, or 6% on a constant-currency basis. Throughout the year, we intently focused on winning new business for our highest-value solutions in the markets we've targeted for profitable participation. And there are great many signs of our success, including: New business with retailers and branded manufacturers for adherence packaging and health care; new business with the biggest brand owners in the North American beverage market; and new beverage packaging machines placed with global and local customers in both developed and emerging markets; new business for plastic medical dispensers in North America and Europe; new business from food brands specifying our products to their converters and contract packagers; and new customers for corrugated packaging in Brazil, from our newest box plant in Ara\u00e7atuba.", "In fact, we've been able to outperform broader market trends and economic performance based on the strategies we have applied to win in the targeted markets and geographies in which we compete. Throughout the year, you'll recall that we've highlighted stronger-than-market performance in corrugated in Brazil, beverage in North America, personal care in Europe and with a range of solutions across markets in Asia.", "Despite our progress, we know that there are some things we still have to address, and we will. And we also know that the political and economic environment in 2013 may likely remain challenging in some of our markets and geographies.", "We've already seen a solid resurgence in volume in January from the low levels at the end of the fourth quarter, as well as strong backlogs for February. With this market improvement and our ongoing growth strategies, we're confident that we're still headed in the right direction and will deliver important earnings and cash flow growth in 2013. We'll do so the same way we have been, by executing on the profitable growth strategies we've established and seizing on the opportunities that are well within our control.", "We have aggressively sharpened our focus on the highest priority initiatives that will have the most direct impact on our performance, including the 4 strategic areas that have paced our performance over the past year. Our focus on commercial excellence, innovation, emerging markets and expanded participation remains constant and steadfast.", "Our push to achieve commercial excellence and earn a larger share of wallet from top customers is leading to significant inroads with branded consumer products and retail customers in our targeted markets. As part of our priority to accelerate the commercialization of innovative value-added solutions, we introduced this year: Shellpak Renew adherence packaging; Melodie fragrance sprayers; Ergosol dispensers for home cleaning products; and just recently launched Intercept, a security package that promotes open merchandising, but also protects against theft. These solutions and others, including Captivate, give us a pipeline of profitable growth opportunities from our special capabilities and insight, innovation and packaging design.", "We already have a long-standing leadership position in emerging markets, especially with our business in Brazil. And in addition to generating more than 25% of our revenue in emerging markets last year, we also invested to further extend this competitive advantage long into the future.", "Our expanded paperboard and corrugated packaging business in Brazil is coming to fruition as we speak. And we've assembled the building blocks of a similar business in India, with the recent purchase of Ruby Macons. Both will have positive top and bottom line impact on our results this year.", "Lastly, expanded participation is about continually assessing our markets for new solutions we can bring to our customers, including technologies and capabilities we may not already have as part of our platform.", "Our financial strength has enabled us to make strategic investments such as Spray Plast, Polytop, Ruby Macons and Resitec that add to our portfolio. And we'll continue to look for those opportunities to make selective acquisitions that strengthen our positions in targeted markets.", "We're pleased with the progress we've already made and confident in the direction we're headed, even as we recognize there are still challenges in the external political and economic environment in some of our markets and geographies. We have reason to be optimistic about early indicators as we start this year and we are committed to making continued progress by focusing on the right strategies and priorities, including things we directly control, such as the Brazil expansion, the integration of Ruby Macons, commercialization of our innovation platforms and our ongoing productivity projects. Through these initiatives and others, we expect to grow revenue and earnings in 2013, as I mentioned a moment ago. Mark will comment further on our full year outlook during his presentation.", "Now I'll turn to Jim for some commentary about our performance in each segment, including more detail on some of the one-time items that impacted our performance during the quarter. Jim?", "James A. Buzzard", "Thank you, John.", "The performance in our business segments during the fourth quarter was good on the top line, but we expected to remain on a higher earnings trajectory, based on the progress we've made with our profitable growth strategies. Instead, earnings were only modestly higher than the fourth quarter last year, which included a significant mill outage.", "There was a dramatic drop in customer activity beginning in mid-November that lowered absorption in our mills and also impacted productivity at some of our packaging facilities around the world.", "Given an uncertain political and economic backdrop during that time, many of our customers had a wait-and-see attitude, which led to lower demand in many packaging end markets and aggressive inventory management across the supply chain. In addition, our pricing actions and mix improvements were not able to offset inflation during the period.", "We did bolster our performance in an otherwise difficult quarter by generating volume growth in some of our targeted packaging and chemicals markets. And we believe we're doing the things we must do to continue to perform well in this tough environment. I'll provide some more detail about performance in each of our segments.", "In our Food & Beverage segment, sales were down slightly, but earnings were higher in the fourth quarter compared to last year, and we had a major outage in our Covington paperboard facility. Sales and earnings in this segment were both essentially flat for the full year.", "In the fourth quarter, we had strong performance in many of the end markets we serve in this segment, but declines in general packaging grades, especially in China, brought down sales overall.", "Beverage volumes and pricing were up, largely due to commercial excellence initiatives with a growing list of strategic global brand owners. Trends for beer and carbonated soft drinks, the primary markets for multi-packs, have been flat in North America and Europe. Our customers there are gaining share with successful promotions, including those based on packaging we've developed. And the multi-pack market is growing in emerging markets, where many customers are investing in our beverage packaging machinery to serve new consumer needs in these emerging markets, especially across Asia. As a result, we outperformed the general trends in the beverage market, including 2% volume growth in the fourth quarter.", "The food market has been pressured by higher retail prices and weak consumer confidence in the U.S. and Western Europe. And as a result, market trends have been lower in those regions, with some offsetting growth in targeted, higher-value segments. We have retained our share in developed markets and grown, in some cases, with major brand owners who are focused on strengthening their brands.", "In addition, we continue to further our innovation pipeline, in part with successful market tests and trials for several new product platforms based on consumer and retailer insights. In Asia, however, our volumes in some categories are tracking below market rates because a large amount of the growth in general packaging grades in China is being serviced from local capacity. Overall, we are seeing strengthening order patterns and backlogs so far in the first quarter. However, we remain cautious given the uncertain economic environment. As such, we expect segment profits in the first quarter to be modestly below year-ago levels.", "In the Home, Health & Beauty segment, sales were about the same in the fourth quarter, and the segment broke even compared to a modest profit last year. Sales and earnings were both essentially flat in the segment for the full year.", "The challenging demand environment had an outsized impact on our performance in certain home, health and beauty markets around the world. And the impact was worsened by a weaker mix and operational issues at a couple of our plants.", "In the personal care market, we are generally tracking at or just above trends in the industry. We gained share in some categories and markets such as fragrance, skin care and hair care, especially in Europe and Asia, primarily with our dispensing solutions. However, late in the quarter, there was a dramatic drop in orders for folding cartons in Europe and Brazil, which led to a negative impact on results.", "In health care, our business continues to be driven by our success with adherence packaging and plastic medical dispensers. During the fourth quarter and for the full year, we continued to grow our market share with preservative-free and metered dosage medical dispensers.", "On the adherence side, market trends remain positive, and our pipeline of commercial activity continues to grow. Key customers are making a planned shift from our original Shellpak product to Shellpak Renew, the new paperboard version of this packaging solution for prescription drugs. During the transition, our volumes were down, as major customers managed inventory levels before switching their SKUs to Renew.", "Lastly, the home market is somewhat soft, leading up to the spring and garden season -- spring lawn and garden season. Major customers in the category have been tightly managing inventories and taking a conservative approach as they assess consumer demand in the coming months.", "The same is true for surface cleaners, which impacted our trigger business in North America during the fourth quarter. We continue to benefit from our Spray Plast and Polytop investments, which helped to drive higher volume in the quarter for triggers, caps and closures, especially in Europe and increasingly in Asia as well.", "In the first quarter, we expect profitability in the Home, Health & Beauty segment to be close to the same as last year and significantly improved compared to the breakeven performance in the fourth quarter.", "Continued growth in targeted personal care and health care packaging markets and seasonal strengthening in home and garden packaging, along with modest recovery in folding carton product lines are expected to result in better asset utilization and improved operating productivity. These benefits will be partially offset by higher resin costs.", "In our Industrial segment, sales and earnings were down during the fourth quarter and for the full year, as the Brazil economy remained weak and our price increases for corrugated packaging lagged behind wage and other inflation. In addition to unfavorable foreign exchange in the quarter, we had $8 million in incremental costs associated with the expansion project as we head toward full utilization later in 2013.", "Our performance in the market for corrugated packaging remain good, again outpacing broader industry trends. We grew corrugated volume by 4% during the fourth quarter as a result of continued commercial strategies to extend our leading position with key customers in food and other consumer non-durables markets. I'd add that Ruby Macons results are included in this segment. We acquired the business in late November and are very excited about the potential for growth in corrugated packaging in India.", "As you look at results in this segment for 2013, we expect to increase earnings by more than 50% from 2012, with an improvement beginning in the second quarter and accelerating in the second half of the year. In the first quarter, earnings will be lower compared to last year due to one-time startup expenses, negative exchange and the absence of a one-time settlement with our utility. We expect to continue our gains in the marketplace, including volume gains and pricing and product mix improvement, as well as making further productivity improvements at our facilities.", "In the Specialty Chemicals segment, sales increased significantly, and earnings were the same as the strong fourth quarter last year. For the full year, we extended gains in both of these metrics. Our commercial work in the marketplace and innovative new formulations continue to be the driver behind strong volume gains for auto carbon and chemicals for asphalt paving, oilfield drilling and adhesives.  These markets are growing on the strength of auto production, especially in the U.S. and China; infrastructure investments in emerging markets; a boom in energy exploration and production; and continued growth in our adhesives markets.", "In addition to these trends continuing in the quarter, we also acquired Resitec in Brazil. We've been a joint venture partner in Resitec for several years, and the acquisition gives us the opportunity to drive additional global growth in this important market. Some charges from this acquisition and higher spend on plant refinery maintenance as part of our 4-plant outage in the quarter, brought earnings down to the same level as last year.", "In the first quarter, we expect to continue our improved year-over-year earnings trajectory in the Specialty Chemicals segment. While we expect the strong margin profile will remain relatively consistent, the absolute profit increase will be more modest as we cycle strong gains in the first half of last year.", "In Community Development and Land Management, our fourth quarter performance capped a great year of land sales and development activity. We are continuing to position our business to benefit from strengthening real estate markets, especially in Charleston. We sold 48,600 acres last year, including 15,000 acres in the fourth quarter, and the strong per-acre values we generated drove our annual earnings performance in this segment.", "The key to success was our highly targeted sales approach that matches land parcels with buyers' interests and timber needs. With the real estate market getting a little better, interest among both individuals and institutions remains good, and we would expect to move a similar amount of acreage in 2013. But we will have a slower start in the first quarter compared to the large land sale we closed last year.", "On the development side of the business, we are making excellent progress and are continuing to gain momentum across the major projects we have underway in the Charleston region, especially Nexton and East Edisto. This includes government funding for a highway interchange, a new school on Nexton and a long-term development agreement with Dorchester County that locks in zoning approval for East Edisto.", "These projects and our well-located sites are positioned to benefit from growth in the region, which is expected to accelerate further with expansion of the port and Boeing's recent purchase of 800 additional acres around its 787 plant.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark. Mark?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Thanks, Jim.", "We have several positive takeaways from our 2012 performance, including progress across key revenue and operating profit metrics that reflect continued improvement in our business model. However, a significant weakening in demand late in the year across a number of our consumer packaging markets and some one-time expenses negatively impacted our fourth quarter results. And while we expect growth conditions to remain challenging, we have confidence that the gains we are making in targeted packaging and specialty chemical markets, including progress with major customers and our new product platforms, combined with the benefits from our capacity expansion in Brazil, will generate solid earnings and cash flow improvement in 2013.", "Before I cover our results and outlook in more detail, let me quickly share some highlights that demonstrate that we are on the right path in executing well on the controllable elements of our business model.", "First, we had solid revenue growth for the year, driven by volume as well as price and product mix improvement in targeted consumer and industrial packaging markets, as well as across key specialty chemicals businesses. Our commercial success is helping us deliver sustainable growth that's above broader market trends.", "Second, despite our lower-than-expected performance in the fourth quarter, our full year adjusted operating profit and operating margin improved substantially versus the prior year on a currency-neutral basis. And lastly, we had positive top and bottom line contribution from Polytop, a caps and closures business we acquired at the end of 2011.", "Now turning to the results, starting with the top line. Fourth quarter revenue grew 4%. Volume growth of 2% was mainly driven by the Specialty Chemicals and Industrial segments. Solid gains in these segments more than offset declines in several of our consumer packaging businesses, including personal care, folding carton and home and garden triggers in the Home, Health & Beauty segment; and in food packaging in the Food & Beverage segment. We saw a significant drop-off in orders in November and December in these businesses as some customers took aggressive actions to reduce their inventories at year end.", "While demand in developed markets remain challenging, we saw improving growth trends in emerging markets, where we're investing to create sustainable positions in growing packaging and specialty chemicals markets. Sales accelerated from the pace that we saw through the first part of the year and increased by over 7% year-over-year, excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions. We saw increases across all of our business segments, especially in the Asia Pacific region and Brazil, including strong performances in beverage, personal care dispensers, liquid packaging and tobacco paperboard and in specialty chemicals products. As a result, we finished the year with emerging market sales representing 25% of total MWV sales.", "Our adjusted operating profit for the year was $488 million, resulting in an operating margin of 9%. However, excluding $58 million of negative currency impact, adjusted operating profit was $546 million, up 10% versus the prior year on that same basis. And our operating margin would have been 9.7%.", "In the fourth quarter, our adjusted operating profit increased compared to the year-ago quarter, $64 million versus $38 million, primarily due to lower mill outage costs and higher land sales in 2012. However, this was lower than what we expected, due to the drop-off in demand that we saw beginning in mid-November across several of our consumer packaging markets and the impact of over $20 million of higher unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs as we significantly reduced production levels to better position our businesses going into 2013.", "We also saw a year-over-year increase in SG&A, largely driven by one-time items including $2 million in acquisition costs related to Ruby Macons and Resitec and $5 million of incremental cost related to employee medical benefit and legal accruals. We expect first quarter SG&A to normalize to a level in line with last year's first quarter.", "Also in the quarter, as expected, we continue to have incremental startup costs of about $8 million related to our Brazil expansion. We expect these costs to decline starting in the current quarter as production levels continue to ramp up.", "Our cash generation in the fourth quarter of $210 million was very strong. Full year cash flow from operations of $330 million was below last year, negatively impacted by several one-time items, including: Almost $40 million of prepaid taxes related to the capacity expansion in Brazil, which will get repaid to us over the next couple of years; $30 million of payments to settle legacy environmental and legal matters; $50 million related to the timing of VAT and income tax payments. Cash flow was also impacted by higher inventories at year end.", "We closed out 2012 with a cash position of over $660 million, which is after paying dividends totaling $173 million and reinvesting $656 million in the business between maintenance capital and strategic growth projects, as well as acquiring new businesses worth approximately $100 million.", "With a substantial reduction in our capital spending for growth investments and significant improvement in operating cash flows, we expect to generate higher levels of free cash flow this year. With improved cash flows and our large cash balance, the board has authorized the company to repurchase 5 million additional shares, giving us total buyback capacity of over 8 million shares, or approximately 5% of the company's outstanding shares. Our plan is to be in the market opportunistically over the next year.", "Now turning to the outlook. We expect to grow earnings and cash flow in 2013 relative to 2012. Earnings growth will come from our recent and new commercial wins, revenues from new products and improving strength in emerging markets. We also expect our capacity expansion in Brazil and year-on-year gross productivity benefits of 3% to 4% to be significant contributors to the company's earnings and cash flow growth in 2013. We will also see contributions from the recently acquired Ruby Macons and Resitec businesses.", "In addition to these drivers, our outlook for the year assumes the following: Current macroeconomic conditions continue, including modest growth in the U.S., improving growth in our key emerging markets, and no significant deterioration in Europe; relatively stable price and mix; modest input cost inflation of 2% to 3%; stable foreign exchange rates in line with current trading ranges; and a tax rate of 31%.", "Given the current demand environment and the timing of expected benefits from our capacity expansion in Brazil, we expect the majority of our earnings growth to be achieved in the second half of the year.", "Looking at the first quarter of 2013, while we're encouraged by the strong bounceback in demand that we've seen in January, we remain cautious on our demand outlook for the full quarter, given the uneven demand patterns that we've seen over the last several quarters. Also, while we expect earnings in Home, Health & Beauty to significantly improve from the fourth quarter, we have difficult compares in our Industrial segment, due to higher startup expenses and last year's one-time gain from a settlement with our utility company, and also in our Land segment, where we expect lower land sales due to a large 12,000-acre transaction that we closed last year. As a result, we expect overall earnings to be lower versus the first quarter of 2012.", "Now back to John.", "John A. Luke", "Thank you, Mark.", "To summarize, we are continuing to manage through a tough environment. We've had success implementing our profitable growth strategies across the company, with good results in many businesses. We're confident in the direction we're headed and pleased to see a modest uptick in demand compared to the very low levels at the end of the fourth quarter. With this improvement and our priority focus on continued execution of our strategies, we expect to deliver sales, earnings and cash flow growth in 2013 and to make further progress toward our long-term profitable growth goals.", "This concludes our prepared remarks this morning, and we'd now be happy to turn to you to address your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So my first question is on Industrial. You talked about a 50% improvement -- 50%-plus improvement in the EBIT there. I just want to come back to kind of the project there and the math around that, make sure I have the numbers kind of square here. So it's a $408 million investment with a 20% return expectation, 2/3 of which is supposed to be cost saves. So according to my math, that's about a $75 million EBIT benefit on the cost side. And if we look at what you're guiding to for the year, it's about $25 million higher in EBIT, understandably with 1Q still having some investments. So it's kind of maybe $40 million outside of 1Q. So I just want to make sure, number one, do I kind of have those numbers right? And does that mean it's just pushed into 2014? Or is the return profile less than what you were thinking before?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Phil, it's Mark. No, the -- we still expect a very strong return profile on this project. We're ramping up really largely in the second half. So to your point, some of that really does push into 2014. But we are -- we remain very bullish on the opportunity for getting good returns from this project and significantly growing cash and earnings in Brazil.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. So would you -- I mean, is it $75 million-ish from cost saves? Is that the right number to be thinking about at this point still?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes. That's roughly in line. Yes. That's roughly in line.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then just on the land side. Obviously, you guys sound reasonably upbeat, and others have as well. So I'm just wondering how you're thinking about the opportunity over time here to start monetizing some of this value. I know a couple of years back, when you held the Analyst Day, you said you wanted to wait a couple of years for the cycle to turn, and we are starting to see that. So just some broader perspective, perhaps John, around how you're thinking about this today?", "John A. Luke", "Sure, Phil. I'd be happy to. Our position remains very much unchanged, and that is we continue to actively evaluate the potential for creating value with that business. We've got a number of very successful initiatives underway, or initiatives that we have every reason will be successful. And those, as they come to fruition, will enhance the overall value of the property. So we're -- it's a both-end situation very much before us.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Gail Glazerman with UBS.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I guess, just -- can you talk a little bit about -- there were some headlines during, I guess, earlier in the month, about investments in India. Can you just discuss a little bit about what you've committed to and what you had planned to do over the next year or 2? Yes, I mean, obviously, beyond the acquisition, but building machines?", "John A. Luke", "Gail, I'll start and ask Mark and Jim to chime in. We concluded the acquisition of Ruby Macons, a very attractive, well-run producer of paperboard for the corrugated packaging market. It's the highest quality producer in India with a low capital base and a low production cost basis. And we're very enthused, both about the opportunity to leverage the market, the leading market position that Ruby Macons has in India; and with that, to participate in the fairly significant growth in that market, driven both by demand, driven by increased consumer market activity, as well as industrial market activity, and a simultaneous recognition of a significant need for the overall improvement in quality in the corrugated marketplace in India. For those of you who travel there, you know that within 24 hours. We have a number of expansion initiatives underway that we have assumed by assuming the ownership, including the addition of a new machine, which is well under construction to serve that market growth. And we're actively evaluating what our strategy should be for downstream participation in the corrugated market.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "And relative to that, Gail -- I mean, there's -- we see great opportunity, bringing some of the capability and knowledge that we have in our manufacturing processes around corrugated business from Rigesa to India. And with that -- and with a modest amount of capital, we believe we can significantly increase yield and capacity on the existing machine. And as John pointed out, given the growth profile in that marketplace, we are also investing in capacity, in a new machine, which, in terms of cost, is at a -- it's very, very modest relative to what you'd see in other parts of the world.", "John A. Luke", "Yes, a modest fraction of -- this is relatively modest capital investment as Mark is indicating.  But one of the things that, just building on Mark's point, that I would emphasize, and we'll talk more about, is that while the structure of the business is different, in that as opposed to being driven by a strong virgin fiber, low-cost virgin fiber mix in Brazil, this is largely OCC recycle-driven. Again, as I mentioned, very high quality. But many of the similarities and experiences that we have learned over many successful years in Brazil are -- will drive our strategy as they apply to India.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And just one last question, sort of following up on Phil's on Brazil. If you think about that 50% growth in guidance that you're looking at, it would seem that you'd get a good portion of the way there just from not having the headwinds that you had as you were executing the project in 2012. I mean, does that suggest -- I'm just trying to understand the trajectory and the ramp-up, going back to the point about 2014, that there's even that much more benefit to come, kind of in 2014, as you fully executed, even relative to the numbers that Phil was putting out?", "James A. Buzzard", "Gail, I think that's right. Clearly, we have had the headwinds that go with any startup, as well as the expenses. The team is making good progress on moving up the curve. And we'll see, as I've said, improvement in Q2, but the real benefit beginning to flow in the back half of this year and then certainly trending even more and accelerating in 2014.", "Operator", "Next question from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.", "Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Two things. As you think about this expanded buyback, can you help us understand it in the context of your aspirations for dividend policy and whether this materially influences what the boards might do with dividend policy over the rest of the year? And also, with respect to how you think about the capital structure, you're one of the few companies with an overfunded pension plan. So I'm wondering how you think about that impact on your leverage, and whether this is the beginning of a new phase or whether you're -- we're going to see you shift back towards dividend. I do have a second question. Sorry, that one's so long. Can you help us just walk through the corporate line item? We all mostly strip out interest expense and restructuring costs, and we're still left with about a $15 million delta from Q3 to Q4.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, Mark. Actually, I think it was more like 5 questions in there. But let me see if I can -- John, you want to...", "John A. Luke", "Yes. Let me start with the questions related to the board and the dividend policy. I think, Mark, a good, fair question. Let me begin by saying we and our board believe strongly in rewarding our shareholders. We have a long history of both preserving and steadily increasing our dividend. And I can assure you that this position has in no way changed. Our buybacks, on buybacks, we will consider those as we go forward, as a function of cash availability, as Mark said in his comments, and market opportunity. The new authorization by the board enhances that flexibility, but it in no way signals a change in direction with respect to approach to rewarding shareholders, specifically with regard to the dividend policy.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, John. I think that's well said. That is -- that has been -- remains a priority. And we look at it -- as we look at our financial policies and our capital structure and our cash balances, we want to make sure that we have -- we're being prudent in terms of how we economically deploy capital. And obviously, one of those options or tools is the repurchase of shares that -- as John said, opportunistically. So they're not mutually exclusive and really reflect, I think, the confidence in our ability to continue to grow our cash flows, as well as the current level of our cash balances. On the corporate expense question, Mark, I think you were referring to a ramp up from Q3 to Q4. So just a little bit of context. Remember that our Q4 spend is seasonally the highest in the year, due to a number of true ups that we make typically at the end of the year for accruals around incentive comp, deferred long-term comp, medical benefits, et cetera. And if you look at last year, you'd see a similar ramp up in Q4 spend. And a chunk of this is non-cash. It's not headcount-related, not reflective of run rate. And if you just look at some of the items that we had, if you look -- bridge from Q3 to Q4, you had -- we trued up our incentive accruals for about $4 million. We had deferred comp expense true ups for about $6 million related to stock price and other accruals. We had legal, employee, medical and other accruals that were up $6 million in the quarter. So a number of these things hit when they hit. Typically, our Q4 spend is higher. But importantly -- we also had acquisition costs related to Ruby Macons and Resitec for $2 million. But as we look out at Q1 next year, we expect to see a spending level that is consistent with what we spent in the first quarter of last year, or I -- yes, the first quarter of 2012. Roughly around $58 million.", "John A. Luke", "Mark, you also raised a question on pension. I just want to close the loop there. And I'll tee that up and then pass over to Mark. I think, suffice it to say, yes, we are gratified by the strongly overfunded pension plan. It gives us very, very strong flexibility as -- and in no way would be a funding drain as we execute our strategy. So we're pleased to have that. I think, with respect to the asset itself, I think, as everyone knows, the rules are understandably very restrictive with respect to how you can utilize that asset. But we have used portions of it for special payments from time to time as permitted by law. And beyond that, it is used for its intended purpose.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes. And as we look at our total compensation structure, we have a very strong benefit around our retirement benefits. And it's a competitive advantage, and we're in a position where we do not have to ever worry about having to fund that again. So it's a good place to be. But really, it doesn't factor in how we think about our leverage or capital structure.", "Operator", "And our next question from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "In your comments on Health, Home & Beauty, you pointed towards customer inventory management at the end market level. But just kind of looking at the results from the various consumer staples guys from Friday, P&G, Kimberly-Clark, et cetera, their volume profile seems to have picked up. So can you just help us reconcile the disconnect there?", "James A. Buzzard", "I think it was as much about their sales into their markets, and yet they manage their supply chains very tightly. So I think as we have seen over the last several years, as people get to the end of the year, they're really working their supply chains hard. I think it's part of the reason we've seen a nice uptick as we come into 2013, is that they've run those supply chains down and now were seeing the benefit of that through some stronger order flows.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then the second question I had was on raw materials. Clearly, plastic resin has ticked higher. Are you seeing some customers sort of order ahead of that? And how should we model the impact on each of your businesses? And if you can comment on the cost basket on Specialty Chems also?", "James A. Buzzard", "Sure. The -- as you noted, resin prices are moving up in January. As you'll recall, much of our business is covered by contractual inflation resin increases. So we will capture those. We're not seeing what I would characterize as prebuying ahead of that. So we will begin to move prices in Q2 as we can and recapture that. So it's a -- while it is an impact, it's more of, like a 1-quarter lag and maybe 2 or 3 months, depending on the timing. So it shouldn't be significant to us over the course of the full year. And in terms of some of the Specialty Chemicals baskets, we're seeing some pressure in some of their raw materials. We're seeing some offsetting declines. But all in, I think we would expect to see a slight increase in their raw material costs in 2013.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Just was hoping to get some color on the $1.2 billion EBITDA goal you had laid out a while ago for 2014. Have there been any significant moves one way or the other that would color your confidence on achieving that?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Mark, let me tackle that one. I think, certainly, we've got a lot of levers that we can pull. Okay? And we highlighted a few of those in our prepared remarks earlier. Certainly, what we've seen relative to the economic climate over the last year or so, including the currency impact, represents a little bit of a headwind. But we're -- as I said, we've got a lot of opportunities to profitably grow our business. We are going to see significant benefits from our capacity expansion in Brazil, from the investment that we've made in Covington and in our Mahrt mill. And we really do expect to continue to see good successes in terms of winning position and share with new products, with our largest customers. We're going to get a nice contribution from Ruby Macons and Resitec. So there's -- it certainly hasn't gotten easier because of some of those headwinds, but we're pushing hard to make it. And I think, as you look at that, too, that we talk about our revenue target of $1 billion, that was -- that's over the next 3 to 5 years. So that -- we might be on the longer end of that. But still, all in, we feel we've -- these are things that are achievable.", "John A. Luke", "Yes. And I would just add, Mark, I think you've said that well. I think that, as hopefully my comments reinforced this morning, we are very bullish on the opportunities in our markets. None of us would have predicted the timing of certain events and/or some of the economic turmoil, but that has not deterred us or dissuaded us with respect to the ambition. We see good opportunities here in the United States. Europe clearly has its own set of challenges. But Brazil, India, China, other parts of Southeast Asia that we are working to develop are excellent opportunities that will contribute nicely to the ambitions we laid out.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Would it be fair to say that while the cushion may be less, that you're still hopeful that you can achieve that $1.2 billion 2014 goal?", "John A. Luke", "Yes, I think that's fair. The cushion -- just look at the impact of currency alone. I mean, that's a $100 million impact, right? So that -- I would say yes, cushion is probably nonexistent. But the fact is that we do have these significant drivers and levers that we can execute against to give us confidence that we've got a decent shot at making it.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Question first on just SG&A. I know, when we were down in Richmond a little over a year ago, you talked about some spending in anticipation of growth, and you've highlighted that at a couple of points last year. I just wonder, with this kind of slower growth market and the fact that your SG&A for the full year is up around 12.5%, whether you're now starting to kind of rethink any of that spend?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Mark, I think that's a fair observation. I would put it this way. We have invested, as you said, to try this profitable revenue growth. And I think I'd characterize it a little bit ahead of the curve. Tougher economic environment, no doubt. I think we have an opportunity, and I think John highlighted it in some of his remarks, to really get focused and prioritize where we see the biggest opportunities and to look at allocating resources to those opportunities. But by getting more focused, I think there's an opportunity, as we grow that top line, to see some real improvement on the total spend level and therefore, to see an improvement in that rate of SG&A as a percentage of sales. And certainly, it's our intention to reduce that level this year.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then the second question I had is just around Health, Home & Beauty. It just seems to me that if we look at sort of all of the capital that you've put in that business, the investment in Calmar, the investment in Spray Plast, the investment in PolyTop and then the things that you've just done internally, the number for the full year in terms of EBIT, sort of a $35 million to $40 million number, doesn't seem like a great return on all of those investments over the last 6 or 7 years. Can we get your thoughts on that?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, let me start, and Jim or John can fill in. Yes, it's not where we wanted it to be. I mean, that's a fact. I think we have an opportunity to significantly improve the operating model, and we are intent on doing that. And while there are some cost opportunities there, we can run more efficiently in our factories, injection molding, on assembly. The big opportunity comes from us being much more successful commercially and continuing to grow our share in big accounts and really, to bring these new product platforms that we're very excited about to market. We believe our Airless technology is going to be a significant driver of revenue growth over the years to come. And we have invested heavily in our adherence business, right? We think there's a great opportunity, given where that market is heading, the market, frankly, that we're creating, to see significant revenue growth in our health care adherence packaging, as well, and leverage that -- the investments that we've made in SG&A and innovation to grow that business. So we are going to improve that business model, and that's largely going to come through some profitable revenue growth.", "John A. Luke", "Yes. And I would just add to that a little bit of color. Mark alluded to the commercialization of the innovation initiatives we have underway. That is one of those very top priorities, as is taking technology that has come from the Polytop acquisition and leveraging that around the world and doing all of this without a huge investment in capital, but leveraging the investment that we have made, making modest investments to support that growth. But we have, as you alluded, Mark, made investments in these markets that have yet to generate the returns that we desire, but we see significant opportunity with what we have in the pipeline, particularly when matched up against these significant growth potentials that, not only do we see, but frankly are underway in markets like Brazil, India and China, among others. And I would just punctuate Mark's comments on adherence packaging. We have been one of the leaders -- really the leader in this field. The pharma -- while we've had very, very good success, that success pales with respect to the size of the prize, the powerful opportunity that exists. As we do more work in this field, the more we learn from the big pharma companies, that they see the whole field of adherence as a huge untapped opportunity, both for revenue growth for themselves, as well as a major contributor to the health of individuals around -- here and around the world. And they see packaging as playing a key role in ensuring that, that adherence gap is closed. So we're disappointed. We've got initiatives underway. We're working very hard at them, and we're optimistic about the potentials.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. Well, that's great. I think we can all kind of see the opportunities, and we can see some of these very innovative products that you've come up with. We just -- we'd like to see it on the bottom line.", "John A. Luke", "Well, you -- we're all there, Mark.", "Operator", "And we have a question from the line of George Staphos with BoA Merrill Lynch.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Mark basically took both of my questions there. I'm going to try to take a difference swag on it, starting with Home, Health & Beauty. If we look at peer companies within packaging, they have been doing very much the same thing that MeadWestvaco has been doing: investing for growth, investing in emerging markets, adding talent. And yet, when we compare your margins with this peer set, and it's not just this year, guys, the margins have, for a number of years, been below where the peers are. And so I recognize that you're not happy with the performance. But when you audit your performance versus peers, aside from just not being happy, what is it that you think isn't going as well for MeadWestvaco as might be going well for the overall specialty packaging sector? Where is it that you think you could do better? And in turn, what discrete goals do you have for profit improvements this year within that segment? And then I had a follow-on.", "James A. Buzzard", "George, good question. As I look at it and sort of parse it a little bit, you have to remember that our business is a mix of business. So we have both folding carton, injection molding plastics. As we look at those separately and sort of look at our plastics business, we compare pretty well with the competition out there. We have a little bit of a different mix of business, which may be a little bit of a drag to us. But all in all, while we're not satisfied, we certainly are not giving up on efforts to improve it. We actually compare pretty well in that segment. Folding carton is a disappointment to us. As I said in my comments, some of it was self-inflicted operational issues. You can -- rest assured that the team is really working hard to correct that. That hit us in the fourth quarter. Some of it was significant reductions in demand. So we need to continue to focus on that part of the business as well and drive it.", "John A. Luke", "And I would just add to what Jim has said, George. I think very specifically, picking up on part of the comments that Mark and I offered in response to Mark's question, commercializing innovations. We look at what others are doing. I think they've been much more successful in tapping new opportunities on a more aggressive and successful basis than we have. And we have good initiatives in the pipeline. We've got to capitalize on those, and we have to ensure that, that pipeline is continually refilled.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. My follow-on, and I appreciate it, what could you do more aggressively to tap into those market opportunities that you're not doing right now? And what discrete profit improvement goal might you have, if not for this year, over the next 2 years, for that segment?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "I think it gets back to executing against our commercial plans. Right? I think we've got to penetrate our bigger accounts with some very attractive new product platforms that we're developing, and that is going to be the key to our success. And as Jim said, there's certainly operational things that we'll need to address in folding carton, and we're going to fix those as well. But the -- where we see the growth is in the -- I think Mark Wilde referred to it as the plastics business that was formerly Calmar and Polytop and Spray Plast. And we are looking to see substantial operating profit growth in that business next year, margin expansion in that business next year, as well as in the years ahead, as some of these platforms really take root in the marketplace. And...", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Mark, when you say next year, do you mean '13 or '14?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "2013.", "Operator", "And I believe we have time for one last question. That is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "I don't think you went over this. Could you tell us where CapEx ended for the company for this -- for 2012 and sort of give us your view of how it should unfold in '14 and '15, sort of given that you're coming off both of Rigesa and the Covington projects?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, sure, Chip. We closed out the year at $600 million -- roughly $660 million of capital. We will see, as we now completed the expansion in Brazil, as we have -- we will be competing the boiler project in Covington, we will see a substantial decline in our overall capital spend, somewhere between $175 million, $200 million year-over-year. We will have -- we are going to invest some capital to expand capacity in Ruby Macons. But we are going to be on a substantially reduced level of spend beginning in 2013, and that will continue to decline in 2014.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Got you. And just real quickly, one quick follow-up, what -- could you give us a view of how you plan to time, or at least the timing of the -- you mentioned the 5% shares or 8 million shares available for buyback. Often, companies in the packaging world will talk about a time period. They're not going to tell us the day, because -- for obvious reasons. But is that something you would plan to try to get done in the next year, barring some unusual acquisition opportunity? Or is it a little looser than that?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "As I mentioned in my remarks, we're going to be opportunistic. We're looking to do that over the next year. It could be sooner, it could be later, depending on what the, the opportunities out there. And as you said I'm not going to give away the secret sauce here, right? But that's the plan.", "Operator", "And I'll turn it back to our speakers for any closing remarks.", "Jason Thompson", "Okay. Thanks, Lori, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. And I look forward to follow-ups.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Bye.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude your conference. Thank you for your participation and you may disconnect.

Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Operator", "Good morning. My name is Mary Ann. I will be your conference operator for today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the RockTenn Second Quarter Fiscal 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]", "As a reminder, slides are being presented today as part of the conference call. These slides can be accessed at www.rocktenn.com under the Investors page. Ladies and gentlemen, this call is being recorded, April 24, 2013. [Operator Instructions]", "Your speakers for today's call are Mr. James Rubright, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Steve Voorhees, President and Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Rubright, you may begin your conference.", "James A. Rubright", "Thank you. And thank you, all, for joining our call. During the course of the call, we'll make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discuss. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent 10-Q and 10-K for the current fiscal year and the end of last year.", "Also during the call, we'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures. And we'll provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, and it's in the appendix of the slide presentation. The slide presentation is also available on our website.  I'm going to begin with an overview of the quarter, Steve Vorhees will comment on our performance of our businesses during the quarter, and then I'll return to review our balance sheet and key financial statistics and to give you some thoughts with respect to guidance for the remainder of this year and update the '14 guidance.", "Our adjusted earnings of $1.12 per share resulted from strong operating performance and the box market decreased slowly at a relatively slower rate over the prior year, when the market was characterized by relatively tight containerboard markets. Our earnings per share of $4.45 include the release of a tax reserve that we established when we closed the Smurfit acquisition to reflect the possibility that proceeds of the black liquor tax credits received by Smurfit in 2009 might be taxable.", "This quarter, the IRS notified us that it completed its examination of Smurfit's 2009 income tax return. The IRS reviewed and accepted our volumetric calculations of the credit, and they did not raise any questions regarding the taxability of the credits. As a result, we released the reserve, thereby increasing by $649 million the amount of federal NOLs that are available to offset future taxable income for RockTenn. The $254 million credit income represents the cash tax benefit we'll realize from these additional NOLs in future periods. The way it looks now, that's about $3.50 per share in additional cash flow that we'll realize in fiscal '14 and '15. In total, the total expected cash tax benefit of all of our federal tax and state tax loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards is about $625 million in cash tax benefit.", "The $1.12 of adjusted earnings is higher than the guidance we gave last quarter of about $1 a share for this quarter, and the actual pricing and commodity input costs were generally in line with our expectations, as were the normal quarter end accruals and our effective tax rate. The principal difference from our expectations was much better operating performance during the quarter in our box plant system and in our containerboard mills. This favorable operating performance contributed about $0.09 or $0.10 to the increase in earnings per share over the guidance we gave at the outset of the quarter.", "Our Corrugated segment income of $108 million was $32 million higher than last year. As of the end of the last quarter, we've realized $53 per ton on an integrated basis of the $50 per ton price increase published in September of last year. Higher pricing was partially offset by higher commodity input costs, principally for wood, chemicals, natural gas, freight and labor, and by the cost of reduced production from the major maintenance outages that we took during the March quarter.", "Consumer Packaging segment income of $63 million was in line with our expectations for the quarter, with lower pricing and lower display volumes driving a lower profitability. Recycled segment earnings were lower than the prior year's quarter due to lower tons sold and lower recycled fiber prices, which compressed margins, as Steve will discuss.", "Right now, I'll turn it over to Steve to discuss our operations in more detail, who, as I mentioned, will turn it back to me at the end of the call.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Thanks, Jim. I'm going to start with our corrugated box business. Industry box demand increased 1.1% over the prior year and declined 3.2% from the December quarter. Both of these numbers are adjusted for shipping days. The growth of RockTenn's box shipments succeeded the industry. RockTenn's box shipments increased 4.8% over the prior year quarter and decreased only 2.2% from the December quarter. Demand trends for March and the first 3 weeks of April continue to support our view that total shipments in April will be up, although given the 2 more shipment days, may be down slightly on an average day basis.", "As of the end of March, RockTenn operated 93 corrugated container plants in North America. This includes 72 corrugated box plants, 4 sheet feeders and 17 sheet plants. This compares to the 99 plants we operated in the same quarter 1 year ago. We're realizing the mindsets of producing more corrugated boxes from fewer operating locations. Full implementation of our announced closures will further reduce the number of operating locations to 91 at the end of June.", "We're investing in our box plants to improve productivity. During the quarter, we completed the investment of $9 million in high-return de-bottlenecking projects at our Fresno, California, and Fort Worth, Texas, corrugated box plants. These projects have improved the volume and cost structure at each plant.", "During the quarter, we completed the installation of our new standard corrugated box operating system in 4 more plants. This brings to 18 the number of plants operating with the new system. We continue to expect to complete installation of this system in all of our corrugated box plants and sheet feeders during the fiscal year '14. We completed the recovery of the fall containerboard price increase during the quarter, and we're moving to implement the $50 per ton price increase published in Pulp & Paper Week last Friday.", "Moving to containerboard. March industry inventories of 2.2 million tons represent 3.9 weeks of supply. This is below historical averages. Our inventory levels at the end of March were comparable to our inventory levels at the end of December. Our inventories have declined since the end of March and will drop further as a result of increased seasonal demand and the downtime related to our planned outages during the June quarter. These planned inventory levels are within the range necessary for us to maintain customer service levels and minimize supply chain costs.", "Industry operating rates of 92.8% in March were higher than the 10-year average of 92.4% for March. March is typically a high maintenance average month for the industry. During the quarter, we completed the outages at our Fernandina Beach, Florence, Panama City and West Point mills. These outages were very well executed, with the result that our quarterly production was 14,500 tons higher than we planned. We will complete the planned outage at our Hopewell, Virginia, containerboard mill later this month, including the first phase of our major modernization program at that mill.", "Our performance at our Hodge mill continued to improve during the quarter, and during the outage planned for Hodge in June, we will invest $14 million in a number of capital projects that will address most of the remaining operating constraints that's been keeping the mills from realizing full potential from last year's major rebuilding.", "Our overall shipments of containerboard increased by 25,000 tons over last year, reflecting improved market conditions and improved execution at our mill operating locations. In the March quarter of last year, we've produced 12,500 tons at our Matane corrugated medium mill that we operated for a portion of the quarter before permanently closing the mill.", "During the past year, we focused on increasing our sales of higher-margin linerboard and white top. The results during the March quarter reflects the improved mix of our containerboard production. Compared to the prior year quarter, our shipments of medium declined by 31,000 tons and shipments of linerboard and white top increased by 56,000 tons.", "Export markets continued to improve. Industry containerboard exports of 1.1 million tons in the March quarter increased 4.3% from the December quarter. However, export shipments of containerboard totaled 216,000 tons, an increase of 5.6% or 12,000 tons over the December quarter. Our average price in the quarter increased sequentially by $28 per ton, after an increase of $41 per ton during the December quarter. For shipments in the March quarter, average pricing was up $83 per ton from the March 2012 quarter bottom. Pulp pricing was up $13 per ton from the December quarter. We believe that pulp markets are currently stable to improving.", "We've restructured our steam supply agreement at our recycled containerboard mill in Jacksonville. The impact of the restructuring is to eliminate the onerous fixed charge under this contract. This contract has been a primary impediment to our profitable operation of the 600,000-ton mill as a swing mill that we can use to balance supply with our market demand for liner or medium and also for aggregate demand for containerboard. The estimated annual savings from this restructured supply agreement are approximately $7 million per year through 2016.", "Our fuel-oil-to-natural-gas conversion projects remain on track. Our annual run rate of savings from these projects, after taking into account the recent increase in natural gas prices, increased by $15 million in the quarter with the completion of the Fernandina Beach and West Point outages and capturing the benefit of the Hopewell project.", "Moving to the Consumer Packaging segment. Folding carton shipments were up 1.4% over the prior year, but total revenue was down due to soft pricing. Folding carton shipments should continue to strengthen for the balance of the fiscal year due to seasonal demand patterns and some new business mandates that we've won. During the first 3 weeks of April, folding carton volumes are tracking slightly ahead of last year.  Merchandising displays, sales and income declined compared to last year as consumer product companies reduced spending on promotion for new product introductions. SBS operating rates and backlogs have improved, and industry unmade orders of 482,000 tons have increased 51% from November 2012 loan.", "At the Demopolis mill, we successfully completed a significant major maintenance outage during the quarter. Our SBS backlogs are currently somewhat over 6 weeks. CRB demand has been relatively stronger than SBS, with current unmade orders of 165,000 tons, up 39% since January 1, as seasonal demand at converting plants begin. We didn't take any SBS or CRB economic downtime during the March quarter, and we don't expect to for the rest of the fiscal year. Pulp & Paper Week published several price increases for consumer paper board grades on Friday of last week, including $25 per ton for CRB and $15 per ton for SBS. We're moving to implement these increases in these markets.", "Turning to Recycling. We're in the midst of reconfiguring the business to improve profitability. We operate 8 single stream locations where we process multiple recyclable materials, including corrugated, paper, plastic, glass and metals. We're investing in additional single-stream capability in the Atlanta metropolitan area. This capacity will be online by mid-summer. We've exited 8 underperforming nonstrategic locations, and we're consolidating our customer service and accounting activities to one hub in Atlanta.", "We expect profitability to improve, and while the absolute profitability of the recycle business will remain limited in the overall context of our company, the Recycling business continues to play an important role in our integrated company. Recycling earns returns in the -- in excess of the cost of capital that we have employed in the business. They acquire 4 million tons annually for our mills. They sell 700,000 tons of BOK [ph], box cuttings and other waste generated by our converting plants, and they provide us valuable insight through our participation in the global market for recovered fiber.", "At the end of March, our run rate of achieved synergies and performance improvements was in excess of $375 million. This is $50 million higher than the $325 million rate as of the end of December. I've already spoken to the primary areas of improvement, that is the improvements we've achieved in the box plant system as a result of consolidation and capital investment and also the improvement in our containerboard mill system. We expect to achieve the remainder of our $550 million target by the end of fiscal year 2014.", "With that, I'll turn it back to Jim. Jim?", "James A. Rubright", "Thanks, Steve. I'd like to address input costs. Wood fiber cost increased for us sequentially by about $1 million, energy cost increased by about $9 million, both of which are partly attributable to normal winter cost and consumption patterns. Our chemicals increased by $5 million, and the cost of recycled fiber increased $16 million. Market composite average prices for recovered fiber increased $15 per ton in the March quarter to $108 per ton.", "If market prices did not increase in April, concurrent market conditions wouldn't support a further increase in May. After May, normal seasonal trends would suggest moderately higher recycled fiber costs, but that will depend in large part upon future Chinese demand. Natural gas front month prices are approximately $4.23 per MMBtu, and the 12-month strip of approximately $438 per MMBtu compares to an average price of $334 in the March quarter. Wood costs appear to have plateaued for the balance of the year. We would expect continued moderation of our wood costs based on our inventory position and improvements to our sourcing strategies.", "With respect to our guidance for certain financial statistics, we estimate that our depreciation and amortization for fiscal '13 will be $565 million. We expect corporate cost of $27 million in the third quarter and $95 million to $100 million for the fiscal year. We estimate interest expense of $110 million for the year and $27 million for the June quarter. Excluding the impact of the $254 million settled tax matter and other discrete items, our effective tax rate for the quarter would have been 33.3%. This is lower than our expected rate of approximately 37%, and that's primarily due to credits that were reinstated when the federal income tax legislation was enacted in January. Our expected tax rate for the remainder of fiscal 2013 is in the range of 37% to 38%.", "As I mentioned earlier, at March 31, we have unused federal and state tax losses and tax credit carryforwards that total approximately $625 million of cash tax benefit. Of this total, we expect to use the remaining $317 million of cash tax benefit of our federal NOLs during the next 2 and possibly 3 years, depending upon our taxable income. We'll use our net tax benefit of $228 million in cellulosic biofuel, alternative minimum tax and other federal tax credits over the next 3 or 4 years, again, depending upon our taxable income.", "In any fiscal year, after we've used all of our federal net operating losses, we can use the cellulosic biofuel credits to offset a maximum of 75% of federal cash taxes due. We'll use our $80 million of cash tax benefit from the state loss and credit carryforwards over a potentially longer period, depending upon our state taxable income in the future periods.", "As for capital expenditures, we expect those for this year, again, to be in the range of $425 million to $450 million. We're currently estimating total required cash pension contributions to be in the $192 million range in fiscal '13, and we expect pension expense to be about $30 million for the full year. We will make cash contributions of $49 million to our pension plans in the June quarter and $88 million in the September quarter. We estimate that the expenses related to deferred outage costs for the containerboard and bleach paperboard mills will be about $92 million in fiscal '13 as outlined in the table on Page 13.", "At the end of March, our net debt was $3.1 billion, our credit agreement EBITDA was $1.22 billion and our credit agreement debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.65x. We had over $1.3 billion in available liquidity. In March, we repaid a maturity from our existing borrowing facilities for $80 million [ph] in 5 5/8% notes. And in March, Standard & Poor's put RockTenn on positive outlook, implying that our corporate credit rating may improve from BBB- to BBB over the near term. Moody's has maintained our Ba1 rating with a stable outlook.", "During the quarter, we reduced debt by $92 million and made pension contributions in excess of expense of $30 million, which totaled $122 million or $1.67 per share, which is a 4% increase from $1.61 percent per share we generated in the prior year quarter. For the last 12 months, we've generated over $1 billion in cash from operations, we've applied $444 million of CapEx and this left $584 million or $8.04 per share for dividends, debt repayment, pension contributions in excess of expense and acquisitions.", "Looking forward to the June quarter and the balance of the year. The business environment overall is very encouraging. Domestic box and containerboard demand and export demand is solid. Both domestic and export pricing continues to improve, and folding carton and paper forward demand is improving. Last quarter, we forecast full year fiscal 2013 free cash flow available for debt repayment, dividends and pension contributions in excess of expense to be in the range of $700 million or $9.50 to $9.75 per share. We also provided initial guidance for 2014 for the same cash flow in the range of $10.50 to $11.50 per share. These cash flow assumptions were based on assumed flat selling prices and 2% to 2.5% cost input inflation.", "Now that PPW published last Friday the $50 per ton increase in containerboard prices, as well as the increases in SBS and CRB prices that we discussed, we're updating our cash flow guidance for fiscal '13 to the range of $10 to $10.50 per share. The 2013 increase reflects a lag that we'll incur this year between the increase in reported book earnings and the cash recovery from the price increases because as your revenues go up, our accounts receivable will go up. That will level out and won't have the same effect in '14.", "We're also updating our fiscal year '14 guidance based on our revenue estimate, including assumed recovery of the containerboard and related box price increases as well as our current outlook for commodity input costs. We now expect fiscal 2014 free cash flow to be in a range of $14.25 per share to $15 per share.", "This concludes our prepared remarks. And Steve and I are now available to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Weintraub of Buckingham Research.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "First question, just on that guidance for next fiscal year. Obviously, a very big increase from $10.50, $11.50 to $14.25, $15. That would give credit to the containerboard price increase, and is the -- which I would have thought would have been more to the order of about $3. So is the rest primarily the benefit of the cash taxes being low? Or are there some other drivers in there as well?", "James A. Rubright", "Right, Mark. The full benefit of the containerboard increase that we get will be sheltered by our NOLs. So book income will go up by 63%, cash flow will go up by 100% of the proceeds we get from the containerboard increase, and the SBS and the CRB increases.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay. And were there any other -- that certainly would seem to get you there. Were there any other significant variables that got changed as well?", "James A. Rubright", "No. We assume the things that we do from an operating standpoint are going to offset the changes in commodity input cost. The major commodity input cost change that we've seen in the period is the increase in natural gas costs. And by the time we complete the projects that we have in place for the summer through our outage season, we'll be at about 35 Bcf of natural gas consumption, so $1.35 million, so that's probably the largest variance.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Great. And lastly, if you could give a little bit more color on the up -- on what you're doing at Hodge and Hopewell and how much progress you've seen to date at Hodge and how much progress, if the projects go well et cetera, you might achieve. And is that fully included in the $175 million of profit improvement and synergy target that you still have outstanding?", "James A. Rubright", "All right. The answer to the first question -- the second question first, the answer is yes. All of that is baked into the 2013 and 2014 assumptions. The new leadership team that we've had in Hodge has been there since -- basically, since July. They've significantly added to the staffing at the mill, and we've seen consistent increases in the productivity in the mill. While it's inconsistent for some of the reasons we discussed in Steve's call with respect to the capital we'll spend in June, we think we will get the full benefits of that project, which will take it up between 2,400 and 2,500 tons per day. We've been achieving that on some days late in the quarter but not consistently, and basically, there are things we need to do to enable the mill to achieve at that level. But we have made really remarkable progress on all fronts at Hodge over the course of the last -- particularly, the last 6 months as the team has been there long enough to take hold. And they've also identified what we think are the things that will basically remediate the issues that they've been struggling with since we did the outage last year. So Hodge is going to end up being a great asset. Hopewell is about to complete its outage. It was initially scheduled for 20 days, it's now 18. It's a major rebuilding. The thing -- the point I want to make clear is that this is a modernization of the mill and will have dramatic improvements in the quality and consistency of the product. This outage is not primarily related to the volume increase. It's the 2014 outage where we'll put in the extended net press and extend the dryer section that will enable us increase the productive capacity of Hopewell. But what we're doing now are just needed large capital improvements to this mill that will basically create an asset with a very long sustainable life.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Anthony Pettinari of Citi.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "In your February Analyst Day, you talked about steps you've taken to improve commercial performance at your Corrugated business, like moving to standardized terms and pricing. I'm wondering, given those changes, are there differences in the way you're implementing the current price hike compared to the one last year. Do you expect it to be easier this year given some of the changes you've made?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "First of all, I don't think it's easy to mount a price increase. Second, the last price increase did go successfully, and from what you mentioned, Anthony, that team is essentially the same team that will be implementing the second price increase. So I wouldn't look at it as there's a nice significant change in the way that would go this time.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And maybe just a follow-up. I mean, when you look at the commercial excellence opportunities in corrugated that you've outlined, I mean, what percentage of those opportunities are realized? Or maybe what inning are we in, in terms of realizing that improvement?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I think it's an ongoing slug of just trying to get better all the time. So I think we will continue to get better as time goes on, and so I really have trouble saying we're x percent or x inning to the game. The team has made substantial progress, and I think they're excited about the continued progress they can make. And I'd anticipate that they will make continued progress.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then maybe just one last question. In terms of export markets, we've seen some firmness there, are you seeing any opportunities to shift tonnage from export markets into the domestic markets? Or how should we think about that given you had pretty strong volumes in the quarter?", "James A. Rubright", "Yes is the answer. We're growing our box plant volumes faster than the industry and the industry is growing and therefore, we are increasing our domestic tonnage. We have increased the total productive capacity of the system though, simply through performance improvements, and I think as this capital takes holds and as other investments we're making in the system in both the assets and the people, you will see our productive capacity increase. So I'm not sure that exports will decline in total, but we are going to increase the total amount of domestic shipments if the trends continue.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Scott Gaffner of Barclays.", "Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I was hoping you could give us an update on what were the incremental synergies in the quarter. And what's the total to date, not on a run rate basis, but what's the actual total achieved synergies?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Second question first. I don't have the actual amount at my fingertips, so we'll just have to get back to you on that. I think within the quarter, we see that we closed -- had an ongoing closure, set of closures, and that contributed to the increase in synergies. We had 2 capital projects at Fresno and Fort Worth that contributed, and then we had the natural gas -- the fuel-oil-to-natural-gas conversions. And we continued to have a series of operational improvements really across the box plant system and across the mill system, which are just a mass of activity that goes on, and I can't call out any individual one.", "Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then you mentioned the better operating performance at the box plants, and I think you invested $9 million on debottlenecking. Is there -- I know capacity utilization is typically lower in the box plant, but is there some measure you can give us, whether it's capacity utilization, just so that we can sort of understand year-over-year how much more productive you're actually being in those box plants, producing more boxes with pure assets?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I'm having trouble coming up with a measure. I think if you look at our volumes and look at just the number of plants that we have, I gave you the number year-over-year, I think that would be almost a measure of incremental productivity. Our daily shipments in the second quarter were 305 million square feet per day, and that's up 298 million -- over 298 million square feet in the prior year quarter. And the 2 projects that we talked about would have increased the annual throughput by about 100 million square feet at each plant.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Phil Gresh of JP Morgan.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "My first question is just related to the synergies. If I look back at the second quarter of last year, I think your run rate was around $150 million, now you're at $375 million, so that's about $225 million incremental run rate, and I know you guys aren't explicitly calling these synergies out in your bridges. But I guess like for the corrugated side, for example, I would have thought perhaps -- you called out $27 million headwind for other items, and I guess I would have thought perhaps there'd be a bit more of an offset from the synergies. So I was hoping maybe you could just elaborate a little bit more if there are some big buckets perhaps in that other category that are offsets to this. And specifically, I guess, I'm wondering if this implies we still should see some nice upside from Hodge as you get those projects completed?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, what we went over in the call for the year end was the treadmill. And the treadmill includes $70 million for wages and benefits. Then in the quarter that just ended, you start up with the $0.15 per share in the quarter effect of the federal tax withholdings and so forth.", "So there are a number of things that are in the treadmill that -- and I think we discussed this last time, Phil, that we used the performance improvements in capital to offset so that at least today the principal driver in the delta between earnings and prior periods is the increased pricing.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then my second question would be just in terms of kind of the timing of when you would expect the full run rate of the containerboard pricing increase to flow through to the box side and perhaps any color you might have on how you're thinking about this next fiscal quarter. You usually give a little bit of color on that.", "James A. Rubright", "We haven't dialed in this particular quarter because I think that it's easier for us to look at how the price increase will get implemented over the balance of the year than to try to slice it into specific months. Our estimation is that we will execute the price increase as we executed the last one. And we gave almost quarterly updates with respect to how much -- we did give to quarterly updates with respect to how much of the box price we've recovered. So I think that you can assume that within a range of a month or 2, that's the way this one's going to work.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Wilde of Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Jim, just curious, on the box side of things, you did very, very well, looks like, on the price hike, and you've also picked up volume relative to the industry. Those 2 things often don't go together. Is there anything you'd kind of point out here that you think helped you?", "James A. Rubright", "Yes. We've made leadership changes throughout the box plant system this summer and essentially introduced the RockTenn model with respect to box plant performance, so there's been significant improvements in the way we've gone to market with respect to the market strategy. So I agree, I've been -- it is nice to see price go up as volume goes up. So the team has done a great job. I think it's the people and the results that they produced. The other thing was we came into 2000 -- the first year after the Smurfit acquisition, we knew there was a fair amount of national account volume that have been lost that was going to show up last year. So we had a mountain to climb just to overcome -- just to get to even, and then what you're seeing is that year is over and now we're in a new year where at least we started from scratch and the team has had the ability to perform in the marketplace and have its -- the benefit of its actions actually show up in the net increase.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And if I could just kind of follow on that. Often in the business, we hear about sort of individual box plant salespeople or managers kind of making the wrong pricing decisions. Just generally, how much discretion is left at the individual plant level and how much of this has been centralized?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, we're organized regionally and then within region, within business units. So if you think of a relevant geographic market where we have multiple plants, those plants will ultimately report, from business standpoint, to a business unit leader. Within that business unit, they have decision rights with respect to certain pricing. Then that -- as that cascades up, it ultimately may get to me, just depending upon what it is. But there is visibility and sort of defined rights with respect to pricing. But an individual plant would have input into its business unit, but the first level pricing decision is made at a business unit level by a person whose responsibility is pricing for that business unit and who reports up through a structure with respect to which you have visibility and pricing control, overall pricing decisions. So if you said why is your pricing more effective, the answer is we actually have visibility and discipline with respect to those decisions.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then the last thing I was curious about, you mentioned again the idea of using Jacksonville as kind of swing capacity. And I wondered if you could just talk about how you do that from a practical sense. Because you've got highly trained staff, how do you manage to kind of furlough them, bring them back, furlough them? What -- how do you manage that process?", "James A. Rubright", "Right. With the first swing -- this is a mill that can make medium or liner, and so we can balance our system and balance our needs from a product category in Jacksonville at essentially no disruption. Because it is a recycled mill, the costs of turning it on and turning it off are not great. And so it does become the swing capacity. That is not our choice, it is not our desire to send people home, but if we have to, that is the most efficient place in the entire system with which we can do it. As you know, we've invested an awful lot of time, money and effort in order to stabilize that mill so that it will be a part of our system for as long as we can see. But it, nonetheless, will be a mill that if we need to do, will be the mill that we will idle. Again, as I mentioned, it is -- from an operating standpoint, a recycled mill is completely different from the standpoint of temporary idling than a virgin mill. And I think you're familiar with some of the reasons why.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from George Staphos of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I guess, I had a few questions to start. Jim, to the extent that you've seen good volume here in the quarter that's just concluded, do you think any of it's related to trying to buy ahead of the next price increases in the market? Or have you seen fairly broad-based volume? And what actions, if any, do you take to try to prevent somebody from trying to build inventory on the customer side ahead of price increase that you want to implement on a going-forward basis?", "James A. Rubright", "Right, they're good questions. The answer is -- to the first one, is we did not see significant efforts to buy ahead of the price increase, for starters. Second, with respect to how do you stop it, we know, with respect to every customer, how much they buy and the trends on which they buy. And there is a pricing organization that monitors those volumes, and to the extent that we see an order that comes in that is outside the bounds of what we have established as what that customer will be allocated for the period, the order is not accepted. So it's really making sure that you got systems in place, the visibility to essentially ensure that you're not allowing the marketplace to take advantage of you. And we now have that in place, and we have people who have the discipline to enforce that.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Fair enough. To the extent that -- obviously, the business is a very diverse business in terms of end markets, and this question comes up in other conference calls, is there any market right now that you're seeing particular strength that you can attribute their growth and the tightness in the market for that matter as well?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "We don't have extreme visibility. However, we do serve the agriculture market, primarily out in California, and I think we're seeing some firming of that market. I think other than that, it's hard to discern trends. Overall, nondurable goods consumptions remain pretty steady, and that's what we're tied to. So again, other than agricultural markets, hard to spot on.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Understood. Looking at the outage projection for the upcoming quarter. I have the slide deck from last quarter in front of me. I want to say that outages are now projected to be lower by, I think, something around 40,000 tons. Could you confirm or validate that? And I'm assuming it's just being driven by, again, the better-than-expected volume outlook in corrugated relative to, say, perhaps, would have been the case 3 months ago.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "George, I don't have that slide.", "James A. Rubright", "Jim is here. Jim Porter is here. Jim, you want to -- I'm going to hand the phone over to Jim.", "James B. Porter", "So your question is the difference in volumes for shutdowns this next quarter?", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "That's correct. It looks like it's dipped and I wonder -- say, Jim, about 40,000 tons or so from the last projection. And I'm assuming that's just the volume outlook improving relative to the last 3 months. Could you validate that and confirm the reasoning?", "James B. Porter", "Okay. We're currently targeting about 66,000 tons for the current June quarter, and we executed 100,000 tons in our second quarter that just completed, which was favorable to our forecast by approximately 15,000 tons. We're expecting the June quarter volumes to also be down from what was originally forecast by about that same amount. It's largely due to refinement of our shutdown planning and better execution.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "And George, I think we need to get back to you about the outlook.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Steve, that's fine. The last question, I'll turn it over. To the extent -- and this is piggybacking on Mark's question from a couple of minutes ago. To the extent that the regions have a fair amount of discretion, obviously with central oversight in terms of pricing decisions, do the regions and do the plant managers actually know what their own level of profitability is by plant or by region or within the customer base so as to help them make their pricing decisions? If not, is that something that ultimately will evolve and become more the case within the system?", "James A. Rubright", "No, I mean all of our plants are profit centers so that we have a plant level P&L that is visible to every plant manager and they're -- while they have a variety of financial measures to which they manage, the profitability of the plant is one.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Chip Dillon of Vertical Research Partners.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "First question, just to be sure, on the free cash flow guidance. I know that this basically includes EBITDA and takes out maintenance CapEx -- sorry, CapEx, interest and cash taxes. But I believe, on the pension contribution, should we use the gross number, I think 190-some, or the net number in the 160s to sort of -- if we wanted to take that out?", "James A. Rubright", "The net number. We're referring to the amount of free cash flow available for pension contributions in excess of expense.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Got you, okay. And on that, this year, it looks like the net number is around 162. What would -- and I know you've given us the pass with the highway bill last year. What do you expect next year to look like? Do you have an early sort of guesstimate?", "James A. Rubright", "We do. John, what's the number?", "John D. Stakel", "It should be probably closer to 200 -- $200 million roughly plus or minus, but I could follow up with you on that.", "James A. Rubright", "Were you able to hear John?", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Yes, absolutely. And then, I guess, as we look into next year, going back to the original merger or acquisition a couple of years ago of Smurfit-Stone, I know that you expected several years of elevated CapEx, and you've updated us for this year. Can you give us an update as how you see, in rough numbers, the CapEx trending in '14 and again in '15?", "James A. Rubright", "I think we've said we think CapEx for '14 will be the same $425 million to $450 million. That's our current view. '15 is pretty early days for us to say. Certainly, we could run our system on significantly less CapEx than that. But we think the opportunity to invest in the mills and the box plant system will continue beyond '14 into '15. We also, as you know, have about $100 million in boiler MACT that we'll pay in -- that will extent at the back end of that period. Not a lot of that will be spent in '14, I think it's '15 and '16 capital. That's about $100 million so that's not in the '14 -- not much of that's in the '14 guidance.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Got you. And last question, looking at Slide 7, in the improvement year-to-year in the Corrugated Packaging segment, there is that $27 million in other. Was there anything that was -- you would regard as unusual? Or is that sort of the typical, I guess, employee compensation and health care and all that, that is reflected in that increase?", "James A. Rubright", "That's the treadmill.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Alex Ovshey of Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I just wanted to follow up again on that other line of $27 million negative on a quarterly basis. I mean as we think about your fiscal '14 guidance, is that the assumption that the treadmill minus productivity and other cost-savings initiative that you have in the system is still going to be a negative $100 million in fiscal '14 relative to fiscal '13?", "James A. Rubright", "I'm not sure we get the $100 million. The $27 million in the quarter, of course, as we indicated, this quarter, you have [indiscernible] taxes, and that's $0.15 in the quarter. That declined by $0.05 quarter over the next 2 quarters. So the answer is no, you can't multiply $27 million by 4 and get the right answer. There are a lot of moving parts in the assumption with respect to what goes up and what goes down, so I'm not able to parse all of them for you into the actual numbers in the box plant system, but the net is the cash flow guidance that we gave you at the outset.", "Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Maybe the other way I'm asking the question is for fiscal year '13, I mean, that other line, is that supposed to really come back to 0 once the seasonality for the different costs is smoothed out throughout the course of the year?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, to the extent that you're comparing year-over-year, the other line, there's always going to be negatives in the other line. And in order to outrun the other, you've got to either increase pricing, increase volume through productivity or reduce your input cost, which is I think of that as the nonemployee cost of goods sold, which you may -- by reducing waste, you may enhance your chip sourcing to optimize the cost of your fiber into your mills. You may optimize the freight. I mean, there's a million things you do. But they're not necessarily going to show up in the freight line, they're going to be blended in the price mix, volume and input cost lines.", "Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. All right, sure. And then just shifting to Consumer business, you talked about Pulp & Paper Week recognizing, I believe, $25 of the CRB increase and $15 of the bleached board increase. So can you talk about what your expectations are for further potential price improvement? And be curious to hear your thoughts on why CRB pricing appears to be moving up quicker than SBS pricing is?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, first of all, with respect to our intentions with respect to future price increases, I can't speak. With respect to the what's happening in the marketplace is that with respect to CRB unmade orders have increased really to historically very strong numbers, and that suggests the tightness in the CRB market that is a criteria for the ability to move pricing. We are moving into a seasonally stronger period for paperboard, and folding cartons is the principal end use. So I would say that the industry conditions overall are healthy, although the markets are extremely competitive. There's -- in the bleached market, SBS, it's more complex than CRB because bleached is an exported commodity. There are 2 very large producers in the market, and we're not either of them. But -- so our visibility with respect to the tightness of that market is really limited to the published data, and that would suggest that unmade orders have increased really pretty significantly. In the folding space where we operate, because our end market for substantially all of our bleached paperboard is folding cartons, our backlogs have trended up nicely, and they were over 4 weeks at Demopolis today. So again, you see improving conditions in the marketplace, and that is about as much as I can say with respect to that.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Philip Ng of Jefferies.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "In terms of price increases on containerboard, you guys were able to get prices above market levels because you had some below-market contracts. Is there still a good amount of opportunity for this round?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, first of all, I don't agree with your premise. The reason you generally try to get more than a containerboard increase is that the box price increase attempts to give the box plant the opportunity to capture margin that they've lost over a period of time. So box prices tend to -- at least there's an effort for the box prices to increase more than the underlying containerboard price increase. And in our market, markets are either -- prices are generally either going up or going down. And the time that the box plant can perform best is in a market in which prices generally are going up, including tight containerboard market. So that is what is driving the increase, as well as simply our discipline and execution of the implementation of the box price increase downstream of containerboard. My expectations for this box price increases that the team will perform in a similar manner, whether that suggests that they'll do exactly the same or not, is going to play out over the next 2 or 3 months. A lot of the increases -- a lot of the stuff is contractual. Typically your national account contract and many other contracts with local accounts will adjust with PPW so there's a lot of business that's going to increase generally dollar per dollar, sometimes at a discount, with the containerboard increase.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Got you. And then at least in the trade publications, there has been a lot of chatter that some larger national accounts may look to put more business up for bid. Have you seen any of that? Or is it still too early to call?", "James A. Rubright", "Yes, it's too early to say.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. All right. That's fine, Jim. And then on the Consumer Packaging business, I understand the lag is associated with passing pricing to the folding cartons typically is a little longer than your Corrugated business. So my first question is really the declines in CRB and SBS prices last year, has it fully flowed through to your P&L for Consumer Packaging yet? And then on the flip side, how quickly should we expect this recent round of box price increase flow through your P&L?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, we've talked about the fact that price increases over time have, generally, like a 6-month as opposed to a 3-month run rate period, and I think that the erosion generally should be offset relatively near term by the price increases. So I would expect -- it's hard to say, but I would expect more or less stable pricing over the balance of this quarter, possibly slightly deteriorating. And then the impact of the price increases should enable us to improve overall pricing in the out quarters. But again, it's pretty competitive market, and we will just have to see.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mark Connelly of CLSA.", "Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Just 2 things. With respect to display activity, some of the consumer products companies are telling us that they are changing the timing of their promotion and not especially the amount. But everything written in the newspapers says consumers are pulling back. So what do you think is actually driving the weaker display activity?", "James A. Rubright", "Fewer new product introductions and fewer promotions. We're just seeing fewer -- less activity.", "Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Okay, okay. And do you attribute that to a pullback with the economy or are you just not close enough to it?", "James A. Rubright", "Mark, I don't know what drives the decision of the consumer products company. I see the result of that decision, and the result is we've seen some delays and cutbacks in promotional spending. It's not dramatic, but it is definitely a factor.", "Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Sure, sure. And just one last question, your market pulp exposure is not that big. But is that something over time you expect to live with or try to work down?", "James A. Rubright", "The market pulp at Demopolis is pretty structural. We've seen incremental gains in paper machine production, but the cost of significantly increasing the paperboard production at Demopolis is really pretty significant. With respect to containerboard, our -- the pulp primarily comes out of Panama City, and again, the cost of significant increases in containerboard production in that mill would be relatively significant. So while you'll see some marginal increases through productivity and so forth in capital on the machines, you're not going to -- you won't -- we don't have an easy ability to dramatically swing that market pulp exposure down.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Adam Josephson of KeyBanc.", "Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Jim, regarding OCC, you're expecting those costs to inch up over the next few months. But obviously, longer term, you expressed your belief that those costs could be significantly upward-biased owing to higher Chinese demand and a finite supply. Do you expect future increases to be more substantial than what you're expecting this year?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, if you look at the volatility of recycled fiber pricing over time, it looks like the Sawtooth Mountains, and then it has periods of plateaus. We're in a period of plateau. So what I would expect in the future is, at some point, a return to pretty significant volatility just because of the inelasticity of supply relative to demand. So when we have the steep pricing increases, I can't say. But the driver will be the growth of Chinese exports and domestic consumption and ultimately, the clearing price for containerboard in China. I mean, if you say what is the thing that bounds the price of recycled fiber in the United States, it's Chinese containerboard pricing. And I just have to tell you I'm -- if you ask me what Chinese containerboard pricing is going to be in 2016, I'm going to tell you I'm not sure.", "Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Right, understood. And for wood fiber, obviously, you think they peaked for the year. Beyond this year, do you expect any meaningful upward pressure for being -- owing to wood pallet exports or otherwise?", "James A. Rubright", "In some markets potentially. Virginia has seen some -- probably some more pressure on our markets than are others for just the things that you're talking about, pallet plants and wood burners and so forth. So I think we'll see some upward pressure in Virginia. In the other markets, no, I don't see anything that really necessarily changes the dynamic. The housing recovery, we think that's net neutral to us. It might impose some short-term constraints, but then I believe residuals overcomes that and you get back to where we are. In the performance improvements, we really have baked in a pretty significant amount for improving the virgin fiber sourcing. We've significantly improved the leadership team there with an identified need that we felt we had, which we're finally able to just fill with just the right people. And so I think you'll see our sourcing costs -- even if you have upward cost of wood in our markets, you're going to see our relative costs decline. So I think wood cost should be favorable, as well as I also think our chip efficiency with respect to our mill production is an area that was really unexploited, and so we expect net wood cost to the paper machine to actually decline regardless of what you see in the markets going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Al Kabili of Macquarie.", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Just a question on free cash flow for next year, which is impressive and well ahead of your initial expectation. And I was wondering how you were thinking about the allocation of that given the upside. Do you see sort of more of that just going to greater deleveraging than you initially anticipated? Or do you see more opportunity with that for box plant acquisitions to improve your integration rate, dividends, even potentially share repurchases?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, we stated a near-term goal of reducing leverage to 2x. So first things we're going to do is reduce the leverage to 2x. After that, it's a great question. We like box plant acquisitions, and we did one this quarter. It happened to be very small, but we did. The ability to make box plant acquisitions will be a function of what comes to the market and how well it fits with our system because typically the best buyer ends up being the buyer, and that has been true with respect to the cor pack acquisition we did last year, the one in Alabama, as I've said. So I can't predict our ability to do box plant acquisitions. It will be largely a function of what the opportunity set is relative to our system benefits.", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "And then, how...", "James A. Rubright", "Go ahead.", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "I'm sorry, no. I interrupted.", "James A. Rubright", "And then, obviously, our dividend rate right now is below what we've said is our long-term target. So I think we will look at the dividend. And then we basically don't have a problem returning money to shareholders, but we will deal with that opportunity, hopefully, really soon, see what we'll do.", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Okay. I mean it just seems like you're going to have a lot of flexibility there. And share repurchases, does that also potentially factor in the equation? And how do you kind of look at assessing relative returns when making these decisions? Box plants, what are your expectations typically in hurdle rates there?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, we don't do an acquisition if we don't think it exceeds our cost of capital, and we don't look at our cost of capital as some theoretical exercise. We look at what our free cash flow returns on market equity are, and that's our hurdle rate. So you can impute that from what we've generated in the -- over the long term and what we expect to continue to generate. We are not averse to buying back stock, we've done so in the past, but over the last 7 years, our acquisitions have enabled us to apply free cash flow to deleveraging. But at some point, when you get significantly below 2x, share repurchases are a great means to return capital to your shareholders.", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Okay, very good. And then just to follow up on some questions on the performance improvements. Does -- is there -- when you get to the $550 million run rate, are you also thinking about EBITDA margins, where you'd like to take those in your corrugated segment? You're still -- there's still certainly runway versus sort of where some of the top tier competitors would be in terms of margins. So I don't know if you have a thought in terms of where -- on a margin -- on an EBITDA margin basis, sort of where you'd like to eventually get the Corrugated business to.", "James A. Rubright", "Well, we've been saying in the past that we thought that high-teens were very achievable. I think the pricing suggests that a higher number than that would be possible. The Southern Container, when we acquired them, had 26% EBITDA margins, and they had -- they did so because they were the low-cost player in the marketplace. So I think that over the long run, somebody's going to have high-20 EBITDA margin in this business. I think IP has got a pretty good head start on us as does Packaging Corp, but I think we have the best opportunity to narrow that gap just because of the way the business that we acquired was managed and invested. So I think you'll see us closing that gap. How high the industry can take the margins is -- I think, remains to be seen.", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then just final question and the clarification on the free cash flow. Is it reasonable to assume -- in your estimate for '14, I know you're not getting real specific on some of the items, but $50 million to $100 million of cash taxes, is that a reasonable sort of ballpark estimate consistent with how you're thinking about things?", "James A. Rubright", "No, because in '14, I think, our liability will be for state taxes only, and that number is a little bit below $50 million.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] There are no further questions.", "James A.

Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for standing by, and welcome to the MWV First Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Also, as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Director of Investor Relations, Jason Thompson. Please go ahead.", "Jason Thompson", "Thanks, Percy, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced our results before the market opened, and a notification of this morning's call was broadly disclosed. Further, this morning's call is being webcast at mwv.com, and slides that accompany this call are available there as well.", "I'll briefly remind you that certain statements we make are forward looking and are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties described in our public filings. Furthermore, contents contain time-sensitive information that, although correct today, may change with the passage of time.", "All the results we share this morning are presented on a continuing operations basis. For the first quarter, the company's income from continuing operations was $11 million or $0.06 per share. Excluding special items, adjusted net income from continuing operations was $29 million or $0.16 per share.", "Now here to tell you more about our results for the first quarter are John Luke, Chairman and CEO; Jim Buzzard, our President; and Mark Rajkowski, CFO. I'll now turn the call over to John.", "John A. Luke", "Thanks, Jason, and good morning, all. Our results for the first quarter were very disappointing. Our top line grew modestly due to continued contribution from our profitable growth strategy, and this progress was consistent with the outlook we provided at the time of our last report. However, we had certainly expected earnings to be better than what we reported this morning.", "There were a number of factors that led to lower profits in our businesses, many of them unexpected. First, unseasonably cool weather had a negative impact on demand for both beverage and home and garden packaging as well as asphalt additives, especially in late March when we begin the high season -- when we expect the high season for these markets to begin; second, poor economic conditions in Europe led to losses in our beauty and personal care folding carton business there; third, we had higher-than-expected outage costs at the Mahrt paperboard mill and our Specialty Chemicals facilities; and finally, a spike in resin prices impacted our plastic dispensers business. We believe the impact from these items was transitory and isolated. But they combined to have an unplanned pretax impact of $20 million in the quarter.", "We are confident that the fundamentals of our strategy are sound. Throughout the quarter, we saw continued evidence that we're successfully capturing growth opportunities around the world. Still, we've pressure-tested our assumptions and expectations for the balance of the year, and we're taking a number of actions to ensure that we resume an earnings trajectory that is consistent with our performance goals and longer-term outlook.", "We're continuing to focus on the pillars of our profitable growth strategy, including commercial excellence, innovation, emerging markets and expanded participation. Ongoing work in each of these areas led to positive developments and revenue increases in our targeted markets for Packaging and Specialty Chemicals during the quarter. We earned new food packaging business from several major brand owners and started testing a new application of our shopper-ready packaging system, Captivate, for the beverage market with Coca-Cola. We continued to integrate Ruby Macons in India, which had a positive impact on results as the market there is strong. We had solid gains for our Airless dispensing solutions for personal care and medical plastics solutions for health care markets. And we saw another quarter of volume improvement for our industrial packaging solutions in Brazil, again outpacing the broader industry there.", "Many of the things we've done to set a foundation for our profitable growth strategy are paying off with momentum in the marketplace, whether that's beverage machinery placements in emerging markets that have led to new carton volumes in Asia, innovation investment that have led to new product launches or acquisitions of technologies that have led to new business with key consumer products customers. And there's still more to come as we fully ramp up the industrial packaging expansion in Brazil and launch several new products that are in the final stages of trials and testing before moving to full commercialization.", "As you can see from the announcements we made this morning, we are very focused on accelerating our progress even further. We have named 2 leaders for our Food & Beverage and Home, Health & Beauty segments, each now singularly responsible for improving performance and reaching our profitable growth targets. We're also further refining our focus on the most profitable products and solutions, including specifically exiting our beauty and personal care folding carton operations in Europe and Brazil and focusing on high-value dispensers for these markets. Jim will have more comments on these plans. And we are well under way with an overhead cost reduction program. In this process, our profitable growth strategy is serving as a guide, aligning resources to our top priority initiatives and eliminating noncore overhead costs. We're aiming for savings of as much as $75 million with a significant portion to be realized this year. Mark will have more details on this.", "In addition to these activities, we also made progress during the quarter in evaluating opportunities to unlock the value in our Land Management business. At the end of last year, as market fundamentals improved and our business had a number of positive developments, we retained advisors to help evaluate options that maximize the value of our forestland holdings, our properties with mineral rights and our development properties in the Charleston, South Carolina region. With respect to these development properties, which comprise about 100,000 acres, we will consider structures in which MWV retains control and the existing MWV development team remains engaged to ensure that the stewardship commitments made to the community are fulfilled and that our shareholders benefit from the significant value that has been and will continue to be created with these properties.", "We remain committed to and focused on achieving our goals for business performance and shareholder value, and we're confident we can do so with continued progress on our profitable growth strategies and new and ongoing projects related to productivity and cost reduction.", "Despite lower-than-expected results for the first quarter, we are confident that we're pursuing the right strategy and that our progress will turn into renewed earnings growth in the second half of this year.", "I'll now turn to Jim for commentary about our performance in each segment, including detail on the items that impacted our performance during the quarter. Jim?", "James A. Buzzard", "Thank you, John. While there were some significant external factors impacting our performance in the first quarter, we also had a number of operating challenges. We simply did not operate at the level we are accustomed to. Unlike external influences, such as weather or currency fluctuations, these issues are in our control, and we're addressing them. These efforts, along with the actions John described a moment ago, will ensure we deliver consistent quarterly performance and achieve our long-term financial goals. While the environment is still very difficult, we are confident that we can combine improved earnings -- improved operating performance with our profitable growth strategies to return to the earnings trajectory both we and our shareholders expect.", "", "The operational issues during the quarter happened primarily at our Mahrt paperboard facility and 3 of our Specialty Chemicals facilities. All had major outages during the period that ran longer and cost more than we planned. The total impact was $14 million more in outage-related costs than the first quarter last year.", "We also continued to be affected by poor results from our beauty and personal care folding carton operations in both Brazil and Europe, and these operations lost money during the first quarter. We are exiting this business to improve our focus on attractive, profitable growth opportunities for our higher-value dispensing solutions for fragrance, make up, soap and lotion categories in the beauty and personal care markets. As John noted, these were some of the issues that impacted our overall performance during the quarter.", "Now I'll provide some more detail about performance in each of our segments. The broad Food & Beverage markets were challenged in the quarter by a number of factors. The beverage market was negatively impacted by a weak European economy, a cool and wet start to spring and ongoing shifts in consumer preference away from carbonated soft drinks.", "In the broad food markets, volumes were up marginally as demand was impacted by lower consumer spending, the weather and continuing economic challenges. Against this backdrop, our shipments of bleached paperboard increased 4% compared to last year, and CNK shipments increased by 7% based on strong volume gains in the food end markets.", "Our gains in paperboard volumes are driven by our commercial excellence initiatives with key brand owners. Strong value propositions, including the use of carton board to replace corrugated, lightweighting to provide sustainability benefits and preferred paperboard characteristics for premium tobacco applications in China, all helped drive these gains. We also saw solid carton growth in Asia resulting from the beverage packaging machines we've placed in the region over the last few years. The multi-pack format there is growing well, though off of a relatively small base.", "Another exciting development for us in the beverage market is our innovative package variety station with Coca-Cola. The first prototype was in a test market during the first quarter, and we're extending tests to additional regions later this year.", "Pricing during the quarter was unchanged for our CNK grades and declined by 3% for SBS as a result of competitive pressures that developed during 2012. Product mix was also impacted in the first quarter by a temporary loss of business from a customer due to a change in product specifications. We have developed a modified product that is currently in trial process and performing extremely well, and we fully expect to recover this business during the remainder of 2013. Earnings were lower in the quarter due to lower beverage volumes, lower SBS pricing and product mix, inflationary pressures and the impact of the paperboard mill outages.", "In the second quarter, we expect to see continued volume gains from our commercial excellence initiatives and improved demand in Food & Beverage markets. In addition, our pricing will begin to improve as we implement recently announced increases. However, a planned once-every-5-year cold mill outage at Covington will result in lower segment profit compared to the second quarter last year.", "The Home, Health & Beauty markets also reflected underlying challenges in the first quarter. Weaker consumer spending in Europe and North America impacted personal care volumes, and unseasonably cold and wet weather in North America delayed the start of the spring lawn and garden season. Our customers reported a significant drop in retail activity for the period, and our results reflect this impact. Further, high resin costs were an added drag on our results in the first quarter.", "As we entered the second quarter, however, there were several positive developments in the segment. First, we will be introducing our new all-plastic trigger sprayer, Versa Plast [ph], for the home and automotive cleaning markets in North America. This innovation, based on the technology we acquired with Spray Plast, offers a much enhanced consumer experience and a more sustainable solution through less resin and a lighter weight than similar offerings. Further, we expect to recapture some of the delayed lawn and garden business in the coming weeks.", "In health care, the transition from Shellpak to Shellpak Renew continues to go well. While there are the expected inventory transition issues from any major move of this nature, we continued to see strong interest in these prescription adherence packaging solutions from major pharma companies and retailers alike. In the quarter, we were gratified to win a Responsibility Award from Wal-Mart for the health and wellness benefits provided by Shellpak Renew. In addition, we continue to see strong growth in our plastic medical pumps and dispensers, evidence that our product solutions are gaining increased acceptance in the markets based on the value we provide.", "In the beauty and personal care markets, we made continued progress through commercial excellence initiatives with key customers. Revenue from our top 30 accounts in this business was up solidly compared with the first quarter last year with strong sales of our Airless dispensers and fine mist sprayers for luxury beauty categories.", "In the second quarter, we expect continued progress toward improving returns in the Home, Health & Beauty segment. Home and garden volumes will improve as the springtime home and lawn maintenance season finally ramps up in North America. And we expect continued strong gains from our dispensing solutions, especially medical plastics in health care. We'll also begin to recapture some of our resin costs with contractual price increases throughout the quarter. With these improvements, we expect earnings in the second quarter to be in line with the level from last year.", "In our Industrial segment, the markets in both Brazil and India are being impacted by somewhat slower economic activity. Our sales increased with continued volume gains in Brazil and the addition of Ruby Macons in India, which contributed about $20 million to the top line in the first quarter. This is consistent with our expectations for the integration of Ruby Macons, which is going very well, and the relatively stronger markets in India, which is why we're excited about the long-term potential of this business. Sales in Brazil were also up with recovering volumes in food markets and paperboard sales from the new machine as well as from improved pricing as we have begun raising box prices to offset inflation. The corrugated industry is outpacing GDP slightly in Brazil, and we continue to gain market share with volume growth that exceeds our competitors'.", "Earnings in the Industrial segment were lower, however, due to the impact of wage and materials inflation, which is accelerating across industries in Brazil, and lower productivity as we continue to ramp up the Tres Barras expansion project. In the second quarter, we expect to see improvement in earnings compared to the prior year as a result of the growing benefit of our expansion at Tres Barras, continued volume increases in Brazil and India and the positive impacts from ongoing pricing actions to offset accumulated inflation.", "In Specialty Chemicals, another quarter of solid sales growth resulted from continued gains in markets for pine chemicals, including our value-added solutions for adhesives and oilfield drilling as well as strong sales of carbon technologies. We also had a positive contribution from the acquisition of Resitec in Brazil, where sales were up 6% on a constant currency basis.", "In carbon technologies, we saw modest volume growth in our auto solutions. While the auto manufacturers posted sales gains in North America for the quarter, overall production of vehicles destined for North America was actually down slightly in the quarter as the auto companies managed inventories in their systems. Our volume reflected continued gains in key international automotive markets, including Europe and China.", "Our operating performance in Specialty Chemicals unfortunately did not match our commercial performance in the quarter. We had over 20 days of planned and unplanned outages compared to only a few days last year, and these incremental costs combined to impact productivity by about $6 million. This, along with ongoing investments to support growth, contributed to lower overall segment earnings in the quarter.", "We expect second quarter profits for the Specialty Chemicals segment to be in line with last year's record performance. We are seeing solid recovery in asphalt solutions after a slow start to the paving season in many regions and expect to continue to have volume gains in other pine chemicals markets. The operational challenges are largely behind us, and we do not expect incremental planned maintenance outage expenses in the quarter.", "In Community Development and Land Management, we continued to see good momentum along all fronts of our value creation strategy. And, as John said, we are working on the logical steps to maximize shareholder value from this business.", "We closed 14 land sales transactions totaling approximately 11,300 acres, both well ahead of last year's pace, not including the large single forest land tract we sold in the first quarter last year. The value per acre we received continues to increase with improved market conditions and a better mix of properties. We expect these trends to continue as interest in high-quality land picks up steadily.", "And as you may have read, there were several recent events that validate our development strategy in the Charleston region, including new investments by Boeing. As a result, our Nexton project continues to do very well. We signed a contract for a 10-acre site on which the South Carolina research authority will build up to 100,000 square feet of office space, which is in addition to the 100,000-square-foot multi-tenant building already under construction. As we move through 2013, we expect to see a growing contribution to segment results from these and other development activities.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Mark. Mark?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Thanks, Jim. There were several factors that led to disappointing results during the first quarter. Clearly, the external environment proved to be more challenging than expected with unseasonably cool weather delaying the strong selling period in a few of our key end markets and recessionary conditions in Europe and general softness in North America impacting our business in developed markets. As a result, we had weaker sales of some higher-margin business, which impacted mix, and we also saw lower pricing in some of our paperboard solutions. We also didn't operate up to our standards, particularly around the outages at several facilities. The combination of these factors negatively impacted the results in our consumer packaging and chemicals businesses.", "So far during the second quarter, we're starting to see improvement in seasonal end markets such as beverage, home and garden and asphalt. We're also generating price improvement in key paperboard end markets and in our industrial packaging business in Brazil. These are good signs.", "However, we're taking additional measures to accelerate earnings growth. We're exiting our beauty  and personal care folding carton businesses in Brazil and Europe and further reducing overhead costs throughout the enterprise. We are moving aggressively with these actions and expect to see benefits beginning in the second half of 2013.", "In a moment, I'll provide more detail on the actions we're taking, including timing and expected financial impact. But first, I'll quickly run down the quarter.", "Starting with sales, a seasonally weak quarter for our business was also impacted by cooler weather versus last year. We saw very weak sales volumes in March for our beverage and home and garden packaging solutions as well as in our asphalt business and Specialty Chemicals. Not only did we feel the volume impacts from lower sales of these solutions, but the mix was also unfavorable.", "Despite these challenges and continued currency headwinds, we did generate overall revenue growth of over 2% from solid volume gains in retail food, tobacco paperboard and industrial packaging in Brazil. We also had volume gains in targeted pine chemicals and carbon markets in Specialty Chemicals, as well as contributions from the Ruby Macons and Resitec acquisitions that we closed in the fourth quarter of 2012.", "Our adjusted EBIT in the quarter was $75 million versus $127 million last year on the same basis. As John highlighted, there were several significant factors that reduced our earnings year-over-year, including approximately $20 million of unexpected impacts related to our outages, weather-related sales declines, higher resin costs and weaker earnings in our European folding carton business. The quarter was also negatively impacted by the planned ramp-up of our Brazil expansion, weaker price and mix in our Food & Beverage segment and unfavorable foreign exchange.", "Adjusted SG&A of $162 million was 12% of sales, which was essentially flat versus the prior year on the same basis.", "While there were several transitory issues that impacted first quarter's results, we are restless for renewed earnings and cash flow growth. As you heard from John and Jim, we're taking action to strengthen our business model to ensure that we deliver the performance commitments that we've made to shareholders.", "We continue to expect to deliver measurable earnings improvement in the second half of this year not only from the new set of actions that we're taking but also from the big drivers of earnings and cash flow growth that we've invested in, including the expansion of our Brazilian industrial packaging business, cost and productivity benefits from our Covington biomass boiler and contributions from recent bolt-on acquisitions.", "In terms of the new actions that we're taking to accelerate profitable growth, first, as Jim outlined, we're exiting our beauty and personal care folding carton business in Europe and Brazil. We've already begun the process to repurpose our Brazilian folding carton facility to produce higher-margin pumps and dispensers to leverage our advantaged products in what is now one of the world's largest beauty and personal care markets. Exiting these businesses will improve our operating margins in Home, Health & Beauty segment by over 100 basis points when these actions are completed.", "We're also moving forward with overhead cost reduction actions that will generate annual savings of $65 million to $75 million by 2014. These savings will be driven from structural changes and consolidation throughout our businesses in corporate overhead and will largely be achieved through our targeted reduction of 275 to 300 positions throughout the company. We've already initiated a number of actions and expect savings of $25 million to $30 million in 2013, largely in the second half of this year. Cash costs for these actions are not expected to be significant due to the ability to fund a substantial portion of the U.S. restructuring costs from our overfunded pension.", "Before providing an outlook, let me quickly touch on some other items, starting with cash. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was about even with last year with lower operating earnings, offset by lower working capital usage. Our cash balance declined in the quarter, largely due to the combination of a seasonally low sales period for the company and our inventory build for the peak selling periods across many of our packaging and Specialty Chemicals businesses. As we move through the remainder of the year, we expect cash flow from operations to turn positive and to grow our cash position.", "Our cash balance also reflects planned investments we're making to complete large productivity enhancement projects, including the new biomass boiler for the Covington mill. CapEx in the quarter was $114 million, which is down from last year's level of $149 million and primarily reflects reduced spending on the Brazilian business expansion. Our outlook for CapEx in 2013 continues to be $475 million to $525 million, with the $50 million range representing more discretionary growth capital that will deploy opportunistically depending on market developments.", "Now turning to the outlook. While we expect earnings in the second quarter to be below the year-ago quarter, we continue to expect to show renewed earnings growth beginning in the second half of 2013 and solid improvement for the full year. Looking at the second quarter, we are expecting to build on our first quarter volume momentum in key packaging and Specialty Chemicals products lines. In addition, the price mix trajectory is expected to improve as we realize price increases in our Industrial business in Brazil and as we continue to successfully implement announced price increases for key paperboard grades and recoup resin pricing through contractual escalators.", "Input cost inflation is expected to moderate further from the first quarter. The main drivers of our expected second quarter earnings decline versus the previous year are the major cold outage at the Covington mill that Jim referenced and lower land sales compared to last year, which included a large tract sale.", "Looking into the second half and full year 2013, we expect our manufacturing businesses to benefit from volume growth and price and mix improvement. These benefits, along with a step change in earnings performance from the Brazil expansion and gains from both our portfolio actions and cost initiatives, will drive strong earnings improvement in the back half of the year. John?", "John A. Luke", "Thanks, Mark. To sum up, we've described the principal macro and operating challenges that impacted our results in the first quarter as well as the underlying progress we're making with our strategy. We're very focused on improving our results and achieving our longer-term goals, and we're doing so by continuing to execute on our profitable growth strategies and by implementing a series of actions that we've had underway and announced today, including reducing overhead costs, exiting folding carton operations for beauty and personal care and advancing further toward opportunities to unlock value from our Land Management business. We remain confident in our strategic direction, and we're moving forward in this direction with renewed determination.", "This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. We'd now like to turn to you for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "First, one kind of modeling question. The cold outage at Covington, how much roughly might that cost the second quarter? And also, are we talking about $10 million, $15 million less in land sales versus year ago? Or can you bracket that for us?", "John A. Luke", "Mark, I'll turn it to Jim to comment on that.", "James A. Buzzard", "Yes, sure, Mark. The -- our estimate right now is the cold outage, the incremental cost this quarter versus a year ago, in a range of $11 million to $12 million.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "And on the land sales?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Mark, I think right now, based on our forecast, we had a big tract sale there last year. It's probably somewhere in the neighborhood of $8 million to $10 million.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Reduction?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "That's correct.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay, great. And then can you share with us any thoughts on a time line as you evaluate the Land Management business?", "John A. Luke", "Yes, Mark, I'll take that. It's premature to spec out a defined time line as we're in the early stages of the process. We've done a lot of work over the last several months with our advisors and our internal team, and we're very enthusiastic about the potentials. But it would be premature to put a line in the sand that would commit us to a time line. Again, our goal is to move as swiftly as we can with the overriding objective of maximizing the value of the overall holdings with specific focus on the discrete mix that we have of forestland, mineral -- lands with mineral rights and the development properties.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Would it be fair to say it's certainly well within the realm of possible or even probable that there would likely be some specific action taken this calendar year?", "John A. Luke", "Oh, I think that, that would be reasonable to expect. Again, I wouldn't want to go on record promising that, but certainly that is within the clear realm of our hopes and expectations.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Following up on the land. As you think about the opportunity here on the portfolio, you've done a lot of portfolio moves over time, C&OP and others back in the day. So I guess some of those you've used the cash you've gotten from that to buy back stock. More recently, C&OP used it to kind of invest in the Brazil project. So how would you think about uses of any cash that you might get and how much you might return to shareholders given where you are with the balance sheet, et cetera?", "John A. Luke", "Mark, do you want to take that up with Phil?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes. I think job one is to look at unlocking the value, maximizing value for the shareholders, certainly. Remember, the amount of cash will certainly be a function of the structure of the transaction as well. But I think it's fair to say that historically, as you've pointed out, we've been fairly balanced in terms of looking at how we deploy our capital. And certainly, as we get to that point where that's a nice problem to have, obviously we'll be looking at all of those options, including returning value to shareholders.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then on Industrial, it sounds like we're kind of behind the investment phase here. So as we look at the second half of this year, is it reasonable to expect that the Industrial business could start run rating at a 20% EBIT margin?", "James A. Buzzard", "Phil, I think that as we -- as you move through the back half of this year, we will continue to see gains in that business. We're making progress as we speak. We're not satisfied, candidly. I think we need to do more, and the team is focused on that. Certainly, the expectation you've identified is where we anticipate being over time, and that's our expectation. We'll get there at some point. I don't want to make -- name a day specific at this point, obviously.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And just one last question on the SBS business, the price declines there. Now obviously, some of your competitors have already started to see those price declines towards the back half of last year. You didn't really see it until the first quarter. So I guess it sounds like it was a little bit unanticipated, if I read you correctly. Is that the case? Or were some of this contractual flow-through of things that happened last year? How should we think about that? And then with respect to the timing of getting the price increases, it sounds like some of your peers indicated some of this is contractual through 2014 and less in '13. So just maybe walk through some of those dynamics.", "James A. Buzzard", "Sure, I would say that the price declines were more around what you described as contractual. As you said, we held up much better through 2012 than the general market would have suggested. But we did have contract resets, some of which are tied to published indexes that occurred in the beginning of 2013. But those are annual contracts, and so we would expect, as we come out of it this year into 2014 on our contract business, to reset that. On our noncontract business, we're out in the markets talking with customers, moving prices. And while it's too early to comment on what our success rate is going to be, we're seeing some positive momentum right now in the -- in our price moves. We would expect to see gains throughout the quarter and as we enter the back half of 2013.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And how much is contract versus noncontract?", "James A. Buzzard", "On the SBS side, I would say it's probably in the 45%, plus or minus, range is noncontract.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.", "Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "So as you think about what you're seeing with consumer products companies, you mentioned some of your new food packaging rollouts, but we're starting to see food packaging companies retrenching a little bit and maybe pushing back some plans. Is that affecting your expectations for your rollout of new packaging this year? Should we assume that, that's going to slow down?", "James A. Buzzard", "Sorry. Go ahead, John.", "John A. Luke", "Yes, Mark, let me start, and then I'll turn it to Jim. I think that there's no question that there is a general sense of, if not retrenching, everyone is trying to understand what the consumers' priorities are going to be here and around the world. We have with the high-quality board, high-performing board and the sustainability features that are inherently a part of our marketplace offering, seeing sustained and continued interest in what we're offering. And if you marry that up with a number of innovations that we're bringing to the fore, we're finding that there's a good deal of interest that is continuing to mount. But the underlying premise of your question, which is that everything that we're reading would suggest that there is uncertainty about consumer preferences, is in the backdrop. But our momentum is strong, and we have every reason to believe that it will continue. Jim?", "James A. Buzzard", "Not a lot to add to that. I think that John is exactly right. The overlying trends in the markets are as described, but the value propositions that we have, whether it's using carton board to replace corrugated, as I mentioned, whether it's the lightweighting and the requisite sustainability benefits that, that provide, those are providing a lot of opportunities for us in the marketplace, and that's really been the source of our growth to date.", "Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And just one more question. With respect to cold weather, in a business like beverages, when you get cold weather, that business is sort of lost semi-permanently. But in Specialty Chemicals, with paving activity, I would assume that you can recoup most of that. Can you run us through the business if it were affected by the cold weather and where they fall on that equation of where it's lost forever and where it's recoupable?", "James A. Buzzard", "I think the big ones you've identified. So in terms of beverage, I think that is exactly right. If somebody's not going to consume because of cold weather, they're not going to double up later on. Having said that, I think one of the things we are seeing and hearing is that many of our customers are going to increase their promotional activity. So we may get some benefit as a result of some additional spending there. And on the asphalt business, clearly it was slow coming through the end of the first quarter. We do expect to be able to recoup that. There's a link to the season that they can double up, and there's a certain amount of spending that they will do, and we'll recoup that. Home and garden would be another one that the cold weather would delay. Again, we're -- how much of that is lost, we're not sure. We're seeing nicer activity at retail, and that's driving some improvements in Q2. But we'll have to wait and see what the end result of that is. But those would be really the 3 segments that have been impacted.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Going back to the consumer board market, a few companies have discussed seeing a real improvement in backlogs. I'm just wondering if you could discuss what you're seeing and maybe give some perspective in light of the commentary about kind of retrenchment that's supporting the pricing activity in the market currently.", "John A. Luke", "Sure. Jim?", "James A. Buzzard", "Gail, yes, we -- we're seeing good improvement in our backlogs as we came throughout Q1. We're now looking at about 4 to 5 weeks' backlog, and some machines, candidly, we're even stronger than that. And that has built through the quarter and certainly sustained itself through the beginning of the second quarter. I think part of it is a reflection of the fact that at the end of last year, people drove their inventories down. So from a supply chain move, clearly an impact with the closure of the machine that was announced earlier this year. And so all that, I think, has resulted in stronger backlogs. And certainly, the fact that we're shipping around the world, as I noted in my comments, some of the strength we're seeing in places like Asia for the beverage business are helping drive our volumes as well.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And can you give a little more color on the folding carton beauty business that you're backing away from? You referenced they're losing money in the first quarter. Can you maybe quantify that or at least discuss? Is that a trend that you've seen? Has it been kind of a general drag on results? And also, does it consume much? Or can you quantify how much of your board those businesses consume?", "John A. Luke", "Yes, Gail, let me start and then turn to Mark and Jim to comment a little bit more. I think this is a business that we've worked very hard to shore up over time. It has been a business that's been under increasing competitive pressure, and I think the circumstances in Europe and even a growing market like Brazil have demonstrated these characteristics. And I think as we've seen the amount of time, focus as well as the drag on overall earnings that has resulted from this performance, we've made the decision going into this quarter to make the move we've announced today.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, Gail, I would add that we have seen a pretty consistent trend over the last number of quarters. We lost money in the fourth quarter of last year. We lost money again in the current quarter. And as John said, as we look at focusing our activities on the most profitable parts of our business, it's clearly was something that was the right thing to do.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And again, just one last question. Going back to the targets that you've put out at the end of 2011, clearly the bottom line hasn't progressed as you expected. I mean, do you still believe that type of EBITDA growth is achievable within the time frame that you set out? Or would you kind of think that perhaps it's gotten pushed out another year or 2?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Gail, certainly we've seen our fair share of headwinds in terms of some of the softness in the global economy. Currency has not been our friend for sure, particularly in Brazil. But while we've gotten off to a little bit of a slow start here in 2013, we've said all along that a significant portion of our earnings improvement was going to be in the second half of this year. It was going to be a function of the investments that we've made to expand in Brazil, productivity improvements in our mills, bolt-on acquisitions that we've done. And as we highlighted in the release today, we're taking additional actions to improve our margins, both in terms of the exit of our folding carton operations for beauty and personal care in Europe and Brazil as well as another $75 million of overhead cost reduction. So those things -- despite a clearly difficult backdrop, those actions and certainly the expectation in terms of the earnings improvements we'll see in those investments we made give us certainly confidence that we can get there.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "First question on productivity. Can you share with us what your full year productivity target is for the year? I think you've averaged about $125 million over the last 3 years.", "James A. Buzzard", "Our target would be above that number in 2013 driven a lot by the gains we expect to see with the Industrial project down in Brazil. And so we would hope to be well north of that.", "John A. Luke", "And I would add also, Ghansham, in productivity, we include SG&A and overhead costs, right? So we'll see a benefit from some of those savings in the second half of the year as well.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then on the beverage volumes, down 5%. I'm sorry if I missed this, but did you give us a split in terms of Europe versus the U.S.?", "James A. Buzzard", "I don't have the exact split. Europe was worse than North America, and so they were probably reasonably close together. But I don't have the exact breakdown in front of me.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then finally on land, obviously this is a big portfolio to take down for one single entity. So should we sort of expect multiple transactions or tranches, if you will, as you kind of progress through this process of monetizing this portfolio?", "John A. Luke", "Ghansham, it's John. Fair question there. I think it would be our ideal to find a single transaction with the conditions that we have outlined with respect to the Charleston development properties, and a clear answer -- and driving emphasis on achieving good tax efficiency. We recognized that, that ideal outcome, despite what we expect to be a transaction with a broad base of interest, may be difficult to achieve given the mix of holdings that we have in that broader portfolio. And so we're recognizing that there may well be more than a single transaction at play, and we'll know more as we move through the next several weeks.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I'd like to return to kind of the industrial packaging business. And just curious if you can give us some sense of what you think the performance road forward looks like there. If we go back, in '11, you did $20 million in the first quarter. You did $19 million last year. And this year, you did $11 million, and that's after almost $0.5 billion of investment there, plus the addition of Ruby Macons. So if you could just help us think about how performance should ramp up over the next kind of 4 to 6 quarters, I think that'd be helpful.", "John A. Luke", "We'd be happy to do so. Jim, you want to take that?", "James A. Buzzard", "Sure, Mark. I think as you described, certainly we have seen things ramp down from where they have been. A large part of that's driven around, as we've talked, ramping up the new machine. And so we're in that process. I think the other part that's been impacting us is clearly, we've seen inflation in Brazil, and we've not been able to move box prices commensurate with that as we have. And that doesn't always go particularly in sync. And so oftentimes, inflation gets out ahead of box price increase. I think the things that we're seeing now is we're moving box prices. We had some moves in Q1 that are in place. We've just announced a second increase that we are, in fact, implementing. So we're starting to get box pricing back where it needs to be. Clearly, around the expansion project, it had been more than just the machine. So we've been phasing in a new fiber line, a new line kiln. And each of those has an impact on the overall productivity of the mill. We will soon have that behind us, so we'll begin to see that ramping up. Clearly, there have been some impacts of currency over time as well. Having said all of that, I think we clearly see a vision that says we'll get back to that 20% operating rate that we're -- we would expect and then move beyond that. So there's nothing about the project where it is today and what we're doing that suggest that the long-term objectives we laid out are not certainly achievable. We have great confidence we'll do that.", "John A. Luke", "Yes, and I just would punctuate that last point, Mark, by saying that we are restless with the timing, but we are very enthusiastic about the overall potential for this project. And I know you had an opportunity to visit there over the last couple of months and saw firsthand the great work that is underway.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes, I mean, essentially, you've rebuilt that mill. So just calling it a kind of a machine addition kind of understates the difficulty. I'm also curious in Brazil. I just -- I looked at Klabin's results the other day, and their EBITDA margin is up at like 36%. I know there are some differences between you and Klabin in terms of land base, but is that ever a number you could see Rigesa moving toward?", "James A. Buzzard", "I think historically, we've been in that 30% range, maybe slightly lower than that. But I think we certainly would have that as an aspiration we want to move to. As you noted, their mix of business is a little bit different than ours, their land base is somewhat different than ours. But certainly, laying out the targets we've set on -- 20-plus percent on operating margins and getting to 30-plus percent is something we certainly want to expect that we can get to.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And Jim, if I can come for just a minute to kind of food and beverage again to kind of draw a little bit of a comparison. Your biggest competitor in that market was out last week with earnings, and their margins are about 500 basis points above yours. And I just -- I understand kind of the -- some of the mill issues, but is there any reason that kind of your margins shouldn't be pretty similar to their margins in this business?", "James A. Buzzard", "I think over time, there's no reason that we should not get our margins back up there. As you noted, we were impacted fairly significantly by the mill outages. We've had -- and again you have to look at SBS, which is part of that, and CNK. So in the SBS business, we've not seen pricing move up commensurate with the inflation. We're beginning to make that move now. But certainly, as you look at the broader context there, there's no reason that we can't get our margins back up where they've been historically and in line with those targets.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And finally, just any thoughts on kind of ramp forward in Specialty Chemicals?", "James A. Buzzard", "I think Q1 was a tough quarter for us. It was some of the transitory things. We've talked around the asphalt markets, clearly some of the outage issues that we faced that won't hit us in the second quarter. So we would expect our Q2 to be in line with what the record levels were a year ago and then continue to move from there. Clearly, I think the historical year-over-year gains that we've demonstrated given the place that we're operating out of today are -- we're not going to see those kind of year-over-year gains. But we -- certainly, with the investments we have made with Resitec, some of the investments we're making in terms of growth in emerging markets, we would continue to expect to see improved performance year-over-year.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with BoA Merrill Lynch.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I wanted to hit a couple of questions first on the board business. You had mentioned, I think, that you're seeing some signs of increasing promotional activity from your customers related to beverage. I wanted to confirm if that was the case. Then if you can share any details around that, that would be helpful. And the related question in board, can you provide a bit more color or granularity in terms of what happened in terms of that temporary customer loss? I think you said it was related to specifications. What was behind that? And why is it now temporary? And then I had a couple questions on costs.", "James A. Buzzard", "Sure, George. Maybe I'll start with the first 2. In terms of the beverage business and the promotional activity, those are things that we expect to see. So I think those will be manifest in terms of maybe some pricing actions to help move volumes. Beginning to see a little bit of that, but I think we would expect to see that later in the second quarter. As we move into the third quarter, it's where that will begin to really ramp up.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Jim, is that a seasonal comment? Or you're seeing an improvement versus a year ago from what your customers are saying?", "James A. Buzzard", "I think what our customer are saying is that we'll see more promotional activity in 2013 than we might have seen in 2012. Again, those are comments we're getting. We'll have to wait and see how that actually plays out in the marketplace.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. Understood.", "James A. Buzzard", "And in terms of the customer loss, I don't want to go into a lot more specifics there, obviously, but other than to say that we have developed a product now that meets and exceeds the expectations of our customer. We're in extensive trials as we speak, and we expect to recoup that business as we go through 2013.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. Will you be at the recouped level in 2Q? Or you really don't get there until later on in the year?", "James A. Buzzard", "It'll be later on in the year, I'm sure. As I've said, we've got trials that are going on now, and we'll have to work our way through that. So certainly, it'll be a Q3, Q4.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Understood. We appreciate the detail on the cost reductions that are coming and the goal that you laid out. If you could prepare -- or provide a little bit more detail in terms of how that cost reduction target was developed. As I look at -- I think you mentioned in your release or in your material your SG&A-to-sales ratio is still 12%. If you get all of that to the bottom line, that's only about 1% off your SG&A-to-sales ratio, and that's still a relatively high ratio versus peer companies, other wood and paper and forest or packaging. So why is that the right number? Why could there not be more spending? And I had one follow-up to that, and then I'll turn it over.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "George, so the -- really the focus was on really identifying areas of costs that are really not essentially driving our growth agenda, and we continuously review those. Certainly, we have invested a fair amount over the last several years, and we've kind of taken a step back and looked to reset, get more focused. And as we do that, we're doing that in the businesses, we're doing that in our functions, support organizations, and that is not the end of the work. We're going to continuously look to be more efficient to drive costs out. But certainly, at this point in time, we think this is a pretty good step forward. And the other part of this is, as you look at SG&A, is driving the top line and getting the yield out of these investments that we're making, which we're pretty confident that we're going to be able to do. So it's more than just the cost side. I think we're making some pretty good strides in getting that right-sized. And we also expect to see some pressure downward on that margin as a percentage of sales also from higher top line growth.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Would it be fair to say we'll see a little bit less growth spending? If we go back to your packaging day in December of, I guess, 2011, obviously there was a lot of focus on growth. And whether Specialty Chemicals or packaging, certainly Industrial, you've been investing behind growth, yet the growth hasn't necessarily been where you wanted it to be. So realizing that there have been some headwinds, should we expect that maybe MeadWestvaco is going to be spending a little bit less on growth and more trying to get a yield off of the investment that you've already made?", "John A. Luke", "Thanks, George. Let me just comment and invite Jim or Mark to chime in. I think that we will, consistent with Mark's point, continue to look for ways to take cost out of the system. We will continue to invest in growth. We will do it as we see the opportunities, and we see significant opportunities out there. And I think that the last thing we want to do at this stage of the game is severely inhibit our investment in important market facing markets for the profitable growth-generating initiatives.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "First question is on Ruby Macons. I'm not sure when -- this is a small one, but when that deal closed, and you mentioned it added $20 million in revenue for the quarter, is that a little bit less than the normal quarterly run rate? Or is that a good number to go with?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, Chip, it's Mark. The -- that closed at the end of last year, really late in the year, beginning of December, I think. And I think at this point, that's a representative level of sales. And clearly, as we continue to work with the team there, we're looking to drive volumes up. Certainly, the market continues to grow very well, and we're looking at ramping up capacity to meet market needs there.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Got you. And then just as a follow-up, when you look at the land business overall, obviously there's a very different unique of -- a unique set of opportunities in the East Edisto-Charleston area. But as you look at the remaining lands, I seem to recall that most of those lands don't have a lot of really development value but are more recreational. And -- but also, maybe some of them also have strategic fiber, contain strategic fiber for the company. So is it likely that we would see that those lands probably sell for something near or maybe a little above their timber value because of the recreational content? And secondly, would you likely have some supply arrangements assuming that you still have some strategic need for the timber off those lands?", "John A. Luke", "Chip, let me again start on this one. I think you've raised a key point of consideration. As we move through the transaction, broad transaction, we're contemplating it's all about maximizing value and not sacrificing the inherent value of any recreational-related land. So that's very much at the fore. Second, absolutely we will be looking for fiber supply agreements. That's going to be an important condition of any transaction we put together.", "Operator", "Thank you.

With us -- with Steve and me today is Jim Porter, who is the head of our Corrugated Packaging sector.", "During the course of the call, we'll make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discuss.

We'll then open the line to answer questions.", "With a respective overview of the quarter, our coworkers achieved another quarter of excellent results, marked by continuing sustained improvements on our Corrugated Packaging business, improvements that are visible broadly across our operations, and that accelerated rapidly over the last 2 quarters.", "Higher production; reduced waste; sales volume growth; disciplined execution of pricing initiatives, which include our spring corrugated price increase; as well as careful rationalization of our account pricing all contributed to financial results that have met our own high expectations. Adjusted third quarter earnings of $2.16 reflect this strong operating performance, higher pricing and acquisition synergies.", "Net income for the quarter included an $0.08 per share tax benefit from a change in Canadian law, as well as the benefit of research and development tax credits and provision-to-return adjustments that reduced our tax rate to 30.2% for the quarter. Net income also included a $0.10 per share noncash gain from the restructuring of the Jacksonville steam supply contract.", "Our higher earnings delivered strong free cash flow, available for dividends, pension contributions in excess of expense and debt reduction, which totaled $216 million, or $2.96 per share in the quarter, which is 60% greater than the $1.85 per share in the prior year quarter.", "During the quarter, we completed major maintenance outages at 4 of our virgin containerboard mills: Hodge, Hopewell, Stevenson and La Tuque, our Canadian white top liner mill. They were all completed on or ahead of schedule and on budget.", "Reduced production for outage downtime during the quarter was in line with our expectations, about 67,000 tons. Our actual major maintenance downtime was 98,000 tons lower this quarter than the prior year quarter, but more significantly, if you adjust our production for the outage downtime, our quarterly containerboard production was 32,000 tons higher than the prior year quarter. And all of this reflects the capital -- the maintenance and the personnel investments we've made in our mills over the last year.", "Hodge, for those of you who are following it, is perform extremely well after the steps we took during the outage to address a number of constraints following last year's rebuilding project. And then at Hopewell, the major modernization project that we did there has achieved our objectives of dramatically improving product quality and consistency. It enables the mill to produce lighter weight liner grades and it addresses the long-term capital needs of the mill.", "Corrugated Packaging operations are also showing marked improvement. Our converted product sales again exceeded industry-reported averages, and this is an excellent result, it seems to us, given the fact that we've been implementing containerboard and box price increases. We've been systematically addressing the pricing in our lowest-margin integrated accounts, and we closed 19 box plants in the last 2 years, where we've experienced planned attrition from the closed plant that has ranged from approximately 5% to 30% per closed plant.", "Our Consumer business operating income of $76 million was up $13 million over the preceding quarter, although it was down $8 million from the third quarter of 2012 due to generally lower selling prices. We've achieved partial recovery of our spring bleached paperboard and CRB price increases and with our currently high operating rates and strong backlogs, we're in the process of, again, seeking to implement price increases in those paperboard grades.", "We've made significant progress on the realization of synergies and improved -- performance improvements, which reflects the improved execution across our businesses. In the third quarter, synergies and performance improvements were $60 million higher than in the prior year quarter.", "With that overview, I'll now ask Steve to provide a closer look at our operations during the quarter.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Thanks, Jim. I want to start with an overview of industry trends. Industry box volumes as reported by the Fiber Box Association increased by 1.3% in the June quarter over last year and 5.9% over the March quarter. These numbers are not adjusted for shipping days.", "Industry shipments of containerboard for export markets increased by 3.8% over the prior year quarter and declined by 3.7% from the March quarter as the North American production was needed to serve domestic markets.", "Industry inventory levels remained at 2.2 million tons at the end of June. This was essentially flat with June of 2012 and March of '13.", "Industry operating rates for the quarter averaged 97% as compared to 94% one year ago and 95% in the March quarter.", "Operating rates at the end of June were 99%. These improving market conditions provided support for our $50-per-ton containerboard price increase in April, and they provided an environment for our coworkers to deliver outstanding results from the continued improved execution across our Corrugated Packaging business.", "In our box business, third quarter income reflected $18 per ton for the April containerboard price increase. As of the end of June, we were realizing a run rate of $36 per ton of the increase. We expect to complete implementation of our price increase during the September quarter.", "As Jim noted, we continue to increase our box volumes and to outpace the industry. RockTenn's Fiber Box Association shipments increased by 3.8% over the June quarter of last year and 4% over the March quarter. Corrugated box shipments so far in July are up compared to the prior year period.", "As of the end of June, RockTenn operated 93 corrugated container plants in North America. This is 7 plants less than we operated in the same quarter 1 year ago. This is consistent with our strategy of operating larger and more efficient box plants. Our average volumes per plant during the June quarter were 8% higher than last year and 4% higher than the March quarter.", "We've continued to make progress rolling out our new box plant operating system and standard costing. To date, we've implemented the new operating system in 23 box plants and expect to complete the rollout in fiscal '14.", "The combination of a common box plant system and standard costing will allow us to review and manage a better and more comparable metrics-per-plant operations, job costing and estimating, as well as implement common margin-based sales compensation plans.", "Containerboard mill shipments to our box plants and external customers for the quarter increased to just over 1.8 million tons. Export markets remain healthy.", "During the June quarter, we exported approximately 214,000 tons. This is in line with our recent quarters and last year's quarter. Average selling prices increased $102 per ton over the prior year quarter and $35 per ton over the March quarter.", "58% of our export served Latin American customers.", "Recently, export prices have increased the most in the Middle East, and we've reallocated tons to a point where the Middle East deliveries accounted for 19% of our total export shipments this past quarter.", "In April, we successfully completed the first phase of our previously announced major modernization program at our Hopewell containerboard mill. The primary objectives of the $71 million capital investment were quality improvements, energy reductions and the capability to make lighter weight linerboard.", "The project included a new primary dilution control head box and winder, as well as numerous upgrades to the paper machine dryers and controllers. We're seeing the expected quality performance and cost results coming out of the outage. Customers have noticed less variation in the quality characteristics of the paper. This is an improvement appreciated by Hopewell's external customers as well as RockTenn's box plants.", "In Phase 2 of the mill upgrade planned for April 2014, we will install an extended nip press and additional drying capacity and continue to expect the capacity of the machines to increase by up to 350 tons per day. If market conditions do not support the increased production, then we'll be able to produce at levels comparable to those that we are producing today at lower operating cost.", "We completed the scheduled outage of the #4 paper machine at Hodge in June. The outage was successfully completed in 10 days, 4 days earlier than planned. Since the outage, we're achieving the higher and more consistent production rates that we expected.", "We continue to improve our operating performance across our mill system. During the June quarter, we set daily production records at our West Point mill, Coshocton mill and our recycled mill in Jacksonville.", "As we discussed, we plan to increase our maintenance and repair spending for several quarters as we invest to improve the reliability of our mill system. These expenses were $15 million higher than in the prior year quarter. The cumulative result of the collective efforts of our coworkers was to increase Corrugated Packaging segment income for the June quarter to $196 million, or $123 million higher than last year's quarter.", "Corrugated Packaging segment EBITDA for the June quarter was $297 million, $123 million higher than last year. Price increases accounted for $141 million of the increase.", "Domestic corrugated box and board sales accounted for $123 million, or $73 per ton of the increase. Export containerboard sales accounted for $19 million, or $102 per ton, and were offset by pulp, which decreased by $1 million, or $10 per ton, over the prior year quarter.", "Our volume variance over last year was 8 million. This is lower than might be expected from the shipment data until we consider that last year, we sold about 79,000 more tons from inventory than this year. This offset much of the increase in mill shipments during the quarter.", "Moving to input costs, lower recovered fiber prices and higher wood prices effectively offset each other. Chemical, energy and freight cost would have increased by approximately $35 million; and labor, SG&A and other expenses would have increased by $29 million, but were offset by synergies and performance improvements across our integrated corrugated box and mill system.", "Turning to our Consumer Packaging segment. SBS industry backlogs as of July 10 were 5.7 weeks, or 597,000 tons, up 83% from 326,000 tons at the end of December and up 28% from the 466,000 tons reported as of April 3. RockTenn's SBS backlogs now stand at 8 weeks. We informed customers of an SBS price increase of $45 per ton effective August 12 of this year.", "CRB industry backlogs as of July 10 were 4.4 weeks or 187,000 tons, about twice the backlogs one year ago, up 27% from the 147,000 tons reported on April 3. RockTenn's CRB backlogs now stand at 5 weeks. We informed customers of a CRB price increase of $40 per ton effective July 19.", "Sales volumes of our converted products of folding cartons and interior packaging were 5.3 billion square feet, up approximately 3.7% from last year. Sales increased by 1.2% and would have been higher but for the flow-through of lower paperboard prices over the past year.", "Sales of merchandising displays increased by 5% over the prior year quarter and 3% over the March quarter. Margins were up in the quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year.", "So far, in July, our segment volumes are flat to slightly higher than last year. We expect shipments to strengthen as the quarter progresses. The September quarter is typically the seasonally strongest quarter of the year.", "EBITDA in the Consumer Packaging segment declined from $108 million to $101 million in the prior year quarter. While volumes of both paperboard and converted products increased, contributing an additional $8 million to EBITDA, selling prices of both paperboard and converted products declined and increases in energy and wood cost combined to more than offset the volume increase.", "We expect improvement during the September quarter of seasonally strong demand and solid paperboard fundamentals. Recovered fiber prices were about $15 per ton lower this year as compared to the prior year quarter, due in large part to weaker Asian demand, including the impact of the Green Fence policy enforcement in China. While lower prices benefit our mill operations, they reduce the profitability of our recycled segment, where segment volumes declined by 10% over the prior year quarter as we operated 9 fewer plants and sold fewer tons to export markets.", "We continue to focus on reducing the cost of our recycling business, and the benefits of the cost reduction efforts offset most of the effect of the decline in volumes. July postings for domestic and export prices increased by about $10 per ton, and we expect to continue modest increases in these prices during the September quarter.", "At the end of June, our run rate have achieved synergies and performance improvements was in excess of $450 million, $75 million higher than the rate we reported last quarter. We've made significant progress in improving our box plants and containerboard mill systems for the long term, and we have a long runway of current initiatives in progress for us to meet and exceed our $550 million synergies and performance improvement target. We expect to reach the $550 million goal in the June quarter of 2014.", "To say the obvious, we're going to continue to improve the performance of our operations well behind -- well beyond June of 2014. This is necessary in most manufacturing businesses and it's an area where we've excelled in the past and that we expect to continue to excel in the future.", "Moving to input cost. Wood fiber cost declined, as we expected in the June quarter, sequentially by about 2% on a per-unit basis. Wet weather patterns, especially in the southern states, have tightened fiber markets.", "We expect a small increase to prices of less than $1 per ton in the September quarter as we build inventory for the winter months. Natural gas month prices are approximately $3.74 per MMBtu, and the 12 month strip of approximately $3.92 per MMBtu compares to an average price of $4.09 in the June quarter.", "We estimate that our depreciation and amortization for fiscal '13 will be $555 million, and approximately $145 million in the September quarter. Corporate cost decreased to $20 million in the June quarter, due primarily to various pension, post-retirement and other one-time items. We expect corporate cost of $28 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $95 million for the fiscal year. We estimate interest expense of $25 million for the September quarter.", "RockTenn's effective tax rate for the June quarter was 30.2%. We expect the rate for the final quarter of fiscal '13 to be between 35% and 37%. At June 30, we've recorded unused U.S. federal, state and Canadian net operating losses and tax credit that can be used to offset a total of $592 million in cash taxes.", "We expect to use the remaining $263 million tax benefit of our U.S. federal net operating losses during the next 2 years. We will use our remaining tax benefit of $231 million in cellulosic biofuel, alternative minimum tax and other federal credits over the following 2 to 3 years, depending on our taxable income.", "In any fiscal year, after we've utilized all federal net operating losses, the cellulosic biofuel credits can only be used to offset a maximum of 75% of the federal cash taxes due.", "Year-to-date, capital expenditures are $307 million, somewhat below the pace of our guidance of $425 million to $450 million. We continue to expect that our 2013 capital expenditures will land within the range of our guidance.", "We expect to make cash contributions of $88 million to our pension plans in the September quarter, or $82 million in excess of pension expense. As you know, our unfunded qualified pension obligations vary based on the yield of long-term AA-rated corporate bonds.", "We estimate that our GAAP discount rate for our U.S. plan at September 30 will be approximately 5%, or 78 basis points higher than the 4.22% rate used last year. Using 5%, we estimate that our unfunded qualified pension plan obligations at September 30 of this year will be approximately $1.1 billion. This is approximately $40 million lower for each 10-basis-point increase in the long-term rate.", "We estimate that our cash contributions to our qualified pension plans in FY '14 will be approximately $213 million, and pension expense will be approximately $20 million to $25 million, a little less than fiscal year '13.", "We estimate that the expenses related to deferred outage cost for the containerboard and bleached paperboard mills will be about $91 million for the full year fiscal '13 as outlined in the table on Page 13.", "At the end of June, our net debt was just under $3 billion. Our Credit Agreement EBITDA was $1.35 billion, and our Credit Agreement debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.29x. We had over $1.5 billion in available liquidity. During the quarter, we reduced net debt by $144 million and made pension contributions in excess of expense of $45 million.", "At this point, I'll turn it back to Jim.", "James A. Rubright", "Thanks, Steve. If we look forward to the September quarter and the balance of the year, the business environment for Corrugated and Consumer Packaging is encouraging. As Steve detailed, the industry fundamentals, operating rates, inventory levels, unmade orders are all healthy. Export demand remains firm, and export pricing continues to improve.", "On our last quarter's call, we increased our full fiscal year 2013 guidance of free cash flow available for debt repayment, dividends and pension contributions in excess of expense from $9.50 to $9.75 per share to $10 to $10.50 per share.", "Based on the strong results we achieved during the June quarter and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we're increasing this to almost $4 per share in the fourth quarter and to $11 to $11.25 per share for the full fiscal year.", "We expect to be at or close to our 2x leverage ratio target by the end of September. In 2014, we expect that total CapEx will be in the range of $525 million to $550 million, against depreciation and amortization of $580 million. These capital expenditures are about $100 million higher than our prior guidance, but that prior guidance expressly excluded any capital for Boiler MACT compliance.", "Based on the work that we've done so far, we now expect to spend about $45 million on Boiler MACT in 2014, which accounts for almost half of the increase. $28 million of that compliance cost will be part of our total estimated spending of about $80 million on our containerboard mills. We will also spend about $17 million in 2014 on a project with a total estimated cost of $68 million to build a new fluidized bed biomass boiler at our Demopolis bleached paperboard mill. This new boiler will replace 2 1950s power boilers, and thereby will avoid about $30 million in capital that would have been required on those 2 old boilers, solely for Boiler MACT compliance. The new biomass boilers' economics just on their own are high enough to justify this project, but with the avoidance/compliance capital, the project is very attractive. So we decided to move it forward into 2014 and '15.", "In addition, we plan to build a new wood yard and chip delivery system at our Florence, South Carolina containerboard mill, and that will add about $40 million to CapEx.", "The inadequacy of the current wood yard at Florence, as well as the recent experience we had with a similar project at our Demopolis bleached paperboard mill, support our view that this project is very low risk and will generate mid-20s returns based solely on fiber cost savings.", "We also plan to spend about $8 million for some wet end improvements on PM2 at our Solvay recycled containerboard mill. We've done the same modifications at our Fernandina Beach mill, and so we expect again mid-20s returns from the modest capacity increase that will result at the Solvay mill. Our system balance needs these additional tons in the Northeast.", "Regarding our expectation then concerning 2014 free cash flow available for debt reduction, dividends and pension contributions in excess of expense, although we're increasing our capital expenditure guidance by $100 million to include Boiler MACT spending in 2014 and the additional project I mentioned, we also believe we'll generate about $30 million in cash before capital expenditures, then -- was embedded in our prior guidance.", "Thus, our free cash flow per share guidance after capital expenditures is now in the range of $13.25 to $14 per share.", "With our current expectations and our higher earnings just reported this quarter and next quarter, we'll drive our credit agreement leverage ratio to or close to our 2x target by September, and we'll drop significantly below that target as we move through the next fiscal year. We believe that moving forward now in these high-return capital projects is a good use of a small part of the substantial free cash flow that our company is generating.", "This concludes our prepared remarks, and Steve and I are now available to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just -- first question on the CapEx guidance that you talked about for FY '14. At your Analyst Day, you talked about a number of those, $4.25 to $4.50. And so obviously, this is higher than that. But I just want to get a sense of how much of that is kind of simply for FY '14 versus something that may carry forward. Obviously, there's the Boiler MACT component of it, but just want to get your thoughts on kind of the longer-term CapEx in light of this.", "James A. Rubright", "Right. Well, when we gave the $4.25 to $4.50, we were very clear that it didn't include Boiler MACT, and we hadn't done the engineering work, nor had we developed compliant schedules. And so $45 million of that, we're just going to -- we're going to spend in '14, and it's just our decision as to what the appropriate timing for those expenditures are. As I mentioned, if you back into the number, about 17 of that is -- we're treating as Boiler MACT, but it's part of a much larger project at Demopolis. As I mentioned, Phil, the cash that we're generating and the rate at which we're approaching our target has suggested to us that we ought to be moving forward on low-risk, high-return projects, and we're doing so in '14. The ones I've mentioned to you are very, very solid low-risk projects, and they're good uses of our cash. If we can invest in the mid-20s after-tax returns, we think we should do that. It's very difficult to go out beyond '14 at this time. I think we've been very consistent throughout at saying we felt that there was essentially a -- I won't call it unlimited -- but there is a very substantial list of opportunities to invest in our business beyond those that we've described that will provide very good returns, basically, on the basis of cost reduction, not productivity increases. So -- where that is total capacity increases. So I'm just not prepared to give a developed view with -- beyond 2014. Our view with respect to sustaining maintenance capital, though, has not changed significantly. We could run the business for a significantly lower number than even the $4.25 if we had to. That wouldn't be a wise long-term decision, but we could do it for a while. But once you get beyond -- we've got $350 million, those projects are going to have returns, and we're -- if you look at our history, we've had very good returns off of the kind of projects, like those that I've described, that we anticipate executing on.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And I guess somewhat related to this, as you think about the performance in the Corrugated business, you've talked in-depth on the call about the enhancements you've been making across a variety of mills. And so if you think about generally your margins in this business relative to your peers, your expectation that you're going to be achieving these performance improvements faster, can you talk about how you think you can close that margin gap versus the peers over time? How much do you think at this point is something that's structural versus something that's under your control with these CapEx projects that you're focused on?", "James A. Rubright", "Right. Well, I think the first thing to note is we -- I think we're making very significant progress. You have to get apples-to-apples to compare ourselves to the 2 public competitors, Packaging Corp and IP. I think the easiest comparison is Packaging Corp because they're solely a corrugated business. But to get comparable, you have to then allocate to our Corrugated segment the unallocated costs at the corporate level. When we do that, if you dial back a year ago, there was about a 640-basis-point gap between RockTenn and Packaging Corp. In the most recent quarter that we just reported, doing that allocation that I've mentioned, the gap is closer to 300 basis points. So we more than halved the gap in a year. We think that our EBITDA margins in the fourth quarter are going to be in the range of 20%. That would be a no-maintenance downtime quarter, so that would give you an idea of where we see the business currently, and that's not with the most recent pricing increase fully implemented for the whole quarter, but implemented by the end of the quarter. So there's a rate at which we're narrowing the gap. Now I'm just not familiar enough with the actual investment opportunities that our competitors have in their -- particularly their mill systems. Ours is terrific. I know we can take cost out of the mills. As we indicated, we just produced another 32,000 tons on an apples-to-apples basis this quarter versus a year ago. That's just off of basic operations and reliability that we've achieved. So I think we got the ability to move rapidly there. On the box plant side, our strategy is quite clearly to build large, high-volume, very low-cost plants. You've -- I think you're familiar with the Southern Container model, where we had the highest average of the -- anybody I know in the industry in terms of volume across our plants. We're building that today. Part of the capital that we outlined at the investor conference related to significantly upgrading the converting capacity in our box plants, and those plans are laid out really pretty much through 2015. And I think, again, we will take significant cost out of the box plant system, partly funded by closures, partly funded by concentrating the conversion in a smaller number of large, very modern, very high-capacity machines. So it's a little -- I can't really talk about how the rate at which we can close the gap to our competitors, so I don't know what their actions will be. But we have actions in place that, absent changes in pricing or the fiber input, should significantly increase our EBITDA margins over time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I just wanted to piggyback on the line of questioning that Phil had regarding EBITDA margins within Corrugated. And to the extent that you can have visibility on this, which obviously is limited, projecting out farther and farther into the future, do you think that as you get past the $550 million of collective performance improvement and synergies, that the incremental amount that you generate in '15 and '16 can keep up with, or outpace even, the cost treadmill as you've related over time? Do you think you still have that many number of projects and opportunities where you can continue to expand the net margin from what you see right now?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, I think we've done it for 14 years in Corrugated Packaging and in -- if you could take Southern's history, RockTenn's history in Corrugated and then our Consumer Packaging business, so my answer is yes. History would suggest that you can. Clearly, with the investments that we contemplate, we think that we will do so. So the answer is yes, but that answer is with a high degree of confidence given the fact that there will be capital associated with cost-reducing projects.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Jim, do you think that most of the return will come from the box plants? Or will it come more so from the containerboard mills? I know again that it's sometimes a difficult topic to have visibility on, or at least discuss -- if you had to advise us where we should see more progress, where would that be?", "James A. Rubright", "I think the mill system has just tremendous potential given the large investments we can make that have immediate, significant reductions in cost. However, we will make significant progress on the box plant front as well. I don't think we've attempted to quantify what we'll do on the box plant side. And really, if you just look at the schedule of deliveries of the evolves [ph] and so forth that we're ordering, they're pretty far out to the end of this year. So I think the impact on the box plant system, you're actually going to see in fiscal '15 and '16.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. The last question, and I'll turn it over and get back in queue, if -- I don't know if you had mentioned it, but what kind of return are you expecting actually on the biomass project within Demopolis?", "James A. Rubright", "Yes. I think we said mid-20s. And I think it pro-formas out in that range, it's -- I mean -- and the fuel system -- the fuel is there. In other words, this is a bark burner. We're not putting in a waste burner. This is a bark burner, and we have the bark on site. So that's why the economics are really pretty clear because you're just displacing fuel. But if -- I know what the return is today based on fuel costs today that I'm going to displace, but you have to tell me what natural gas and fuel oil are going to be in 2015 and '16 before I can tell you what it will actually be.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And that approximately will be done by '15 -- by '16 or '17?", "James A. Rubright", "We'll complete that, we hope, at the end of '15.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chip Dillon from Vertical Research Partners.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "You mentioned of a, and I really appreciate that, sensitivity measurement that Steve gave us on the pension measurement. And of course, we know the funding is not really tied to GAAP. It's tied, I guess, to how the government defines it. So could you give us some read on what you think '15 would be? Let me give you the assumption that -- let's say that with the -- let's say the break stays exactly where they are now. Would the funding requirement change a lot in '15 versus '14? You mentioned the 2013 going in, in '14?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, first of all, we've given you our current estimate of what the funding is. And John's here. For '14, John, the number is...", "John D. Stakel", "$213 million.", "James A. Rubright", "Yes. We're going to fund $213 million. That's the total contribution...", "John D. Stakel", "Cash contribution.", "James A. Rubright", "That's the total cash contribution. Inexpensively, about $20 million. '15, we have an estimate, but that's going to depend upon some assumptions that -- where interest rates and other factors, investment returns and so forth, I just can't predict. So those are the assumptions we've made. I know we've given you a schedule and it takes you out to about 2018 before we're finished. It is interesting, though, that the unfunded liability from an IRS standpoint is significantly less than the gap unfunded liability. But really, to get into the tale of why that's different than what they are -- probably be better to do not on this call.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Okay. And then this might be for either you, Jim Rubright or Jim Porter, but a couple of questions on what we're seeing out there in terms of the -- a couple of -- 3 start-ups have either converted or new capacity. And I guess one question is we haven't noticed OCC really changing much in terms of the dynamics of pricing in the Northeast, given that you have another competitor that is sizable, buying OCC in upstate New York and other places and just didn't know if you had some reflection on that to help us? And then secondly, are you seeing sort of in the more standard markets that you traffic in? Any impact from the Dublin conversion, or for that matter, the conversion up in Whitby, Ontario?", "James A. Rubright", "Yes. Jim Porter is the closest to that of the 3 of us here, so I'm going to ask Jim if he'll reply.", "James B. Porter", "Yes, Chip. Relative to the 3 containerboard projects that have been talked about quite a bit in the Norampac mill and the Dublin facility and Atlantic Packaging's facility up in the Toronto area, I'll speak to that first. We would expect that the Norampac asset will be a good one and will produce a solidly quality product that will fill in it's -- they're intending much like the Solvay project that we did some years ago. It will be a very modern machine that should produce quality products for those converters that use the product. Dublin and Atlantic, though, we really haven't seen signs of that yet. They've been operating for some time now, but we're not seeing that in the containerboard market. So it -- there's rumors that it's a -- particularly the Dublin facility, is being used for bag paper, but we've really not seen it in the market. And the same with Atlantic. So I think the jury is out as to how those 2 facilities will perform relative to the competitive needs of our industry. Turning now to recovered fiber, there's no doubt that, over time, demand for recovered fiber will go up. We really have not seen that regionally, however, as a result of the Norampac project. We think they did a pretty good job of distributing their initial procurement requirements, and so that marketplace was not disrupted at all. And with the global softening principally with China's demand being off, we generally see a -- I would label as a neutral to soft market right now. So how we forecast that's going to improve over time, it would largely be driven by what's going to happen in China. And I won't try to forecast that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Wilde from Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Jim, just curious, between you and Steve, with the debt coming down here, as you guys highlighted, thoughts on other uses of cash going forward?", "James A. Rubright", "Sure. Mark, the first thing we'll do -- we've just raised our dividend. It's still based on our -- the market price of our stock. If below our target level, that would be sort of the S&P 600 mid-cap range of 1.5 to 1.6. So I think we'll continue to look at ensuring our dividend is competitive. Below 2x, I don't think there's any immediate need to try to buy back stock. And I think we can be opportunistic there because I think we've said we'd be comfortable if we felt we had a use for the cash to get down to something like 1.5x debt-to-EBITDA. But below that, you really feel like you're under-leveraged. Neither Steve nor I are philosophically against it. In fact, we're philosophically in favor of buying back stock. You just want to make sure that you're doing it on a basis that is reasonable relative to the relative market value of your stock. Frankly, I think that's attractive today. But we are going to get to our target before we make any moves. The other thing, people, I think, are focused on the 3 major acquisitions that we've done. But in my 10 years since 1999, we've actually done 24 acquisitions. The range of acquisitions has been from very small to $65 million to $100 million. So we see opportunities out there for infill in our businesses. We just closed a very small box plant acquisition in the Southeast this quarter that somebody has got a box plant in connection with a larger acquisition. They had no use for it, and so we were the logical buyer. We got it at a very attractive price to us and a good transaction for them. Those kind of things arise. But they're not going to use up the multi-hundreds of millions of dollars of free cash flow that we anticipate generating.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. Would you be willing to look at larger acquisitions at this point? And if you did, what would be kind of the focus areas that you would -- you'd look at?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, we look at stuff all the time, Mark. We've always been willing to look. The problem is finding stuff that you have sufficient conviction to transact. I'm not really prepared to talk about what opportunities we would be most focused on now. I think our strategy has always been to identify what we thought were opportunities to acquire businesses that were undervalued, in our view, relative to the market's perception of the business and also places that we can create value because they're extensions of either our business model or our competencies. And so that would be a guide for you of the kinds of things that we would consider. Certainly, we have the balance sheet to effective large transactions, as we showed with Smurfit. If a transaction is attractive enough, we'll issue equity, and we can do that and also do so on a good basis that can be successful for our shareholders.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "All right. Just 2 other quick ones: one, if you could update us on the CFO search; and then two, Smurfit closed down the 2 mills that they had on the West Coast, Snowflake and Missoula. I just wonder whether having some kind of a West Coast mill presence would be a real issue for you guys going forward.", "James A. Rubright", "No. The -- obviously, there was an opportunity on the West Coast recently that we didn't participate in. I think we're fine. We'd actually like to acquire some more converting capacity. So I don't think West Coast capacity is necessarily an issue that we think we need to solve.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then the CFO search?", "James A. Rubright", "Yes, I think that we expect to be closing that out very, very shortly.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "I think you had mentioned going out of the quarter that your corrugated prices was up by about $36 per ton versus the starting point.", "James A. Rubright", "That's correct.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "I thought -- did you mention what it was on average for the second quarter versus -- for the June quarter versus the March quarter?", "James A. Rubright", "We did. That was $18.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "$18. Okay, great. And then lastly, you had talked about increasing your expectations in terms of cash generated from operations for next year by about $30 million. That -- was that an after-tax number you said?", "James A. Rubright", "Yes, that's just cash. It's not really an earnings number, just cash generation.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "And what would be the big bucket drivers of that $30 million? And I guess, really, what I'm trying to understand is, was there -- because you beat consensus expectations by quite a bit in the quarter obviously, and how much of that is that you're operationally performing, perhaps, even better than you would've anticipated and, hence, would be driving higher your expectations of cash generating power?", "James A. Rubright", "Yes. I think we had a pretty good feeling with respect to pricing. So part of it is the effectiveness with which we're recovering price, not only the price increase but, as I mentioned, our ability to really improve the lowest margin integrated accounts that we have. So there is some change in our price realization expectation. Another large part of it is performance, as well as cost inputs. I think we have a more favorable view of recycled fiber pricing next year than we might have had in April. But I'd have to go down line-by-line at the April data, which I'm not fresh enough to do right now, to be more precise on that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citigroup.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just a follow-up question on the 2014, 2015 capital projects. I think you had mentioned that you would -- you were hoping Demopolis would be completed by the end of '15, but I was just wondering if you had a sense of when did that project start. Is it at the beginning of 2014? Or sort of what is the potential disruption to the business, given that you're normally [ph] SBS mill?", "James A. Rubright", "To update [ph], there will be no business disruption because you're building a new boiler. And as I said, the fuel source is there because when we built the additional chip mill, we now are covered with barks. So this boiler is going to burn an existing fuel source on-site, and the other power boilers will operate until it comes online. I think Jim has probably, again, the best view of the construction schedule and the operation schedule, so I'm going to ask, Jim, when do you think will -- you don't have to be precise on when we're going to start, but when do you think we'll have it in service?", "James B. Porter", "Yes. The majority of the cash flow for the spending will hit '15, I believe. And this number is going to be pretty rough, but I think we've got targeted approximately $15 million of cash that gets expended in '14 and then accelerates. I believe that's the precise ...", "James A. Rubright", "But it will be in service at the end of '15?", "James B. Porter", "Yes, exactly. But I think part of the question was what is the cash flow commitment?", "James A. Rubright", "Yes, I think I've said it was $17 million in '14. So it's the number that I cited in the comments, and then the balance, in '15, when we anticipate it will be in service in '15.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, okay. And then maybe another question for Jim. You've outgrown that industry over the last couple of quarters in corrugated with very good price realization. I'm just wondering, to the extent that you can, can you give us any color in terms of where this new business is coming from? Is it coming from national accounts, local accounts, or maybe what the commercial or operational changes you've made that have really allowed you to pick up the business?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, the basic improvement that we've made is just a very intense focus on satisfying our customers with better quality products on time and a much greater level of customer service. And that's embedded in the DNA of our culture, and so that's really the major thrust and the reason that we're being rewarded with business. And it's no -- in no one place. It's clearly balanced in all of our accounts, repeat business, et cetera. And we're just seeing greater confidence from our customers to do business with RockTenn because we do what we say we're going to do.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Alex Ovshey from Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Does your fiscal year '14 free cash flow guidance includes the potential benefit of the recently announced bleach board and CRB price increases?", "James A. Rubright", "It's our current forecast based on everything we know today, yes.", "Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And so are you factoring in that you see some realization of the recently announced?", "James A. Rubright", "Yes.", "Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then on the corrugated or containerboard pricing in the export market, are you expecting any sequential improvement in the September quarter relative to the June quarter in terms of your containerboard prices in the export markets?", "James A. Rubright", "Yes, I don't think we can -- I don't think we feel comfortable responding to what our view is with respect to export pricing. We -- I've said in my earlier comments that the export demand was firm, and we have been realizing higher pricing. But I'm not prepared to be that specific with respect to forecasting prices in the next 2 quarters of '14.", "Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Just one more quick question on the consumer side. You mentioned that I think your backlogs in SBS were about 8 weeks, and I didn't quite catch what the number was in CRB. But can you just remind us what is the historical average level of backlogs in SBS and CRB for you guys?", "James A. Rubright", "Yes, over time, SBS can range to 3 weeks or below to 8. There was a period of time at an absolute peak that we were out to about 9 weeks, but I would say 8 weeks is very high relative to the normal expectation there. 5 weeks, again, is very good in CRB, and the industry unmade order data is quite strong.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Phil Ng from Jefferies.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "This time is the -- this quarter is the first time you guys actually called out the synergy number in the EBIT bridge. The run rate was about $60 million. Is that a good proxy going forward for the next 2 quarters?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, it was $60 million higher than the prior year quarter. I'm not sure we'll be able [ph] to say what we'll achieve in the next quarter.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "First of all, I appreciate you noticing that because I think we've been -- just appreciate you noticing that. I don't have the number at my fingertips for what to expect going forward. We are very -- we feel very good about the progress we're making, as you can tell from our report.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then on the consumer side, price was more of a drag than I expected. But as you've flagged, the April CRB price increase went through, and you're seeing pretty good traction for the July increases for CRB and SBS. How should we think about pricing flow in throwing [ph] the box -- on the folding carton side? Is it a 6-month drag or lag or a little longer? How should we be thinking about that?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, in the past, we've talked about the fact that the contractual structure in the consumer products business is somewhat different than in corrugated, so it does have a greater lag. A number of contracts also have trigger points where the margin -- the published index has to increase by x before you get any adjustments. And the publication last quarter didn't hit some of those triggers. So I think that you will see more realization if we get a publication with respect to this increase than you would've with respect to the last. But I'm not -- I can't forecast what will -- what the publication change will be, and therefore, it will be difficult to actually schedule out the time period under which we'll recover it. But as a practical matter, yes, there is something like a 6- to 9-month lag to the increase, to the realization of whatever you're going to get from a published index pricing in consumer, unlike corrugated, where 5 months out and you got it.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Got you. And I guess just one final question, you did flag that the Norampac mill is coming on nicely. It's a niche product. But I do understand you have a few mills situated in the Northeast as well. Should we be concerned about some of the customers switching suppliers? Or have you gotten any early indication on that front?", "James A. Rubright", "Jim?", "James B. Porter", "We think they'll be making a nice product. And clearly, within their ownership group, there will be integration of much of that volume. There is some impact to our current customer base as a result of that. However, we've known this for quite some time, and we've made provisions to place all of our capacity in, frankly, a very profitable way. So we do not see this as a major disruptive event in the Northeast.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Scott Gaffner from Barclays.", "Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just looking at the pricing in the export market, I realize you didn't want to talk about the absolute number on the pricing, but should we expect your mix of pricing to actually improve? I think you mentioned you're moving some tons into -- I think you said the Middle Eastern market because of higher pricing there. So all else equal, should we expect that to go higher?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, you'll see higher realized pricing in the September quarter if nothing changes because the run rate at the end of the June quarter was higher than it was at the beginning. In fact, in some markets, materially higher. So yes, you will see higher average realized pricing on the export side, we believe, for the September quarter.", "Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And is the pricing in the Middle East, has that been driven by better demand? Or what do you think has been driving the pricing higher there?", "James A. Rubright", "Yes, I'm going to ask Jim again to respond to that.", "James B. Porter", "I think, systemically, we're seeing just better supply-demand balance all over the world, with the same types of balance you see in North America, with operating rates being very high and inventories low. We are matching our production to the demands of our customers. And we frankly view our international customers the same as we do our North American customers. So we sell into those markets in a very balanced way, and we think that provides a more rational and stable pricing structure.", "Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And when I look at the synergy realizations in the third quarter versus the second quarter, the mill and supply chain synergy realization went up to $150 million. It was $110 million last quarter. Is the incremental savings there more on the mill side, on the supply chain side? Can you just parse that out a little bit for us where those incremental savings are coming from?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "It's a number of categories. I think it's hard to split it exactly between mill and supply chain. But on mills, we have a -- just a large number of projects. We've included the natural gas projects, but there's also projects that do not require capital. On the supply chain, it's, I'd say, a significant number of the increase, and it's -- we're getting very good momentum from our supply chain group just on dispatching our system. We have a very large complex system, and each quarter, we're getting better at trimming machines and arranging the freight and providing the containerboard to the box plants. And I have been very pleased with the progress they've made over the past year in that regard.", "Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And once we reach the $550 million, any idea what the upside could be beyond $550 million?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I think once you get past $550 million, you're back to -- I think we'd have a -- there's a normal, there's a treadmill, and we're back to the business as it exists, which is we've got to continue to increase the efficiency of our system and our overall productivity to overcome that treadmill cost. It must be year after year. And like the treadmill cost, we have $100 million to $150 million. So our objective would be to take out that level of cost and, hopefully, more.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Al Kabili from Macquarie Group.", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Just wanted to follow up on an earlier questioning related to outpacing the industry. And it does looks like you got some share last year as -- in the Corrugated business. And as we look to this recent spring price hike, can you give us any sense as to how your shares kind of trending post this spring price hike?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, there's various ways that you have to look at our business. The one that we can do best that is comparable to one of the published statistics that people look at, which are the fiber box statistics, and fiber box doesn't include all of our operations because we got Mexico and other product sales that don't come in the balance, but our business was up 3.8% in the June quarter versus June of the prior year versus the industry. So it's a really pretty strong outperformance of the industry on a year-to-date basis. Versus the industry, we're up 3.1% on a fiber box basis. Those numbers are a little different if you take all of our system into play, the sheet feeders, the preprint in Mexico and so forth, where the numbers are somewhat lower than that, we think, compared to the industry. But that's the best apples-to-apples comparison I can give you.", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "No, and I appreciate that. I guess what I'm getting at is a chunk of this is just I believe you gained some share later last year. And I guess, what I'm wondering is sort of how that's trending as you lap some of that this fall. And when you look into next year, do you see that outperformance that you've had this year? Do you see that continuing? Do you expect you'll be sort of more -- as the way things are trending now, you'll be kind of closer to the FBA data that we track, et cetera, I guess is what I'm trying to get at?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, I believe the team we've put in place can continue to outperform the industry, and it's our goal to do so, but I'm not really prepared to try to forecast what that would be.", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Okay. All right, I appreciate that. Second question is just on inventory, and I know you mentioned your desire to build inventory versus your -- where you're at. And I just wanted to get a sense of sort of where you're at and if that's still an expectation or goal to try and build some inventory later this year.", "James A. Rubright", "That's a great question because we're trying to get it right. And currently, our view is that we're on the skinny side of things relative to inventory to most effectively supply our box plants on a reliable basis, so that they have exactly the right product every time they need it because that expense is upgrading or having out of stock is very costly to us and negatively impactful to the supply chain. So our bias has been to creep inventory assembly line, and I believe you'll see the -- our fourth quarter inventory number is coming up somewhat. At that point, we really should be in pretty good shape, though. We've tried to be cautious, but we've slowly biased towards building inventory over time.", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Okay, I appreciate it. And maybe you don't want to give out in this form, but any sense for how much you'd like to build?", "James A. Rubright", "In the order of magnitude, $25 million to $50 million, in that zone.", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate it. Last question is on the labor and SG&A and on the bridge in the corrugated segment, you called out the $29 million higher year-on-year. And I was wondering, is that inflationary outlook pretty -- do you see that sort of pretty normalized for the quarter and it will continue? Or was that a little -- or was that trending a little bit higher than typical?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I think it's trending a little bit. That's a little bit higher that you should expect it to trend.", "James A. Rubright", "Yes, I want to turn back to the question on Demopolis. One of our people just pulled out the construction schedule, and we were right but wrong. We said the end of '15. It's actually the end of calendar '15 was the actual startup date. So it's going to start up either December of '15 or January of '16. So the spending will fall around after that period of time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steve Chercover from D.A. Davidson.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Just one question at this point. It's very encouraging to see EBITDA margins approaching 20% in Q4, and there's a bit more to come. Is there a point where there's like a terminal margin, that if you go beyond it, you would attract entrance into the industry?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, I'm sure there is. The question is what is that margin, and I don't have a developed view on that.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Do you think, perhaps, low- to mid-20s is a sustainable margin once the price increases in and the economy is just kind of growing at this kind of low single-digit rate?", "James A. Rubright", "Yes, but I'm really not going to speculate on what the maximum sustainable margin of this business could be.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Adam Josephson from KeyBanc.", "Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Just 2 questions. Jim, one on the recent volatility in the reported industry box shipments on an average week basis. Given what should be a fairly stable market month-after-month, what would you attribute those fluctuations to?", "James A. Rubright", "We're all looking at each other too. The data just does fluctuate, whether it's the supply chain data that's reporting anomalies, I don't know, there are a lot of potential answers, but over time, they tend to level out. But I agree with you, there's volatility in the reported data. The data is the data, I don't have an explanation.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "There's a lot of segments of the business that do have strong seasonal components, so the agricultural business, the pizza business, the retail business with electronic commerce, had a strong seasonal time. So you're -- if you mesh all those out over the course of the year, you'd expect them to be pretty stable. But in any particular month, you could have any of those segments just have a significant impact on the aggregate reporting with the industry.", "Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "I appreciate that, Steve. And Jim, just one more for you. You mentioned earlier that you consider your stock fairly attractive where it is today. Can you elaborate on that view at all?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, if -- over the long term, I think 8% to 10% free cash flow returns are really attractive. In low-risk businesses, we generated free cash flow return significantly higher than that for 15 years. And we're generating higher free cash flow returns than that today. And we've basically given an indication of what we think our cash will be next year, and that's a pretty strong free cash flow return, yes. And ultimately, we -- that's -- we're counting the pension contributions, but that's like reducing debt to us, and ultimately, that ends. And in fact, as you know, because we've got the tax benefits. Essentially, the tax benefits offset the after-tax cost of the unfunded pension liabilities. So on a sustainable basis, we're generating a very, very strong free cash flow return. And what we see is a very stable business with great investment opportunities. So it was your words that it was fairly attractive. I'd say it was attractive.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Connelly from CLSA.", "Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "I'll leave the operating questions aside. Just Steve, one question on the pension contribution. There's a lot of excess contribution and a lot of moving parts. Is this going to increase reported EPS? I've asked this question earlier.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "No, our pension expense is relatively stable. I think we've said it's $20 million to $25 million. So the effective cash, I think as you said, was just on an accounting basis, is not a huge impact.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Daniel Downes from B.C. Holdings.", "Daniel Downes", "The M&A question that was posed before, I know you mentioned you're open to deals of all size. But you guys have really made a name with shareholders in creating tremendous value out of sizable deals for this -- for the -- versus the size of the existing enterprise. And just curious, I mean, to what extent is that, now that you're a much bigger company now, your balance sheet's in good shape, are those kind of opportunities existent at this size to make a big difference and that you can improve their operations and make -- generate shareholder value?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, if you'd look at RockTenn today, we have promised capabilities relative to what our capabilities were at the stage at which we've done each of the large acquisitions that you indicate, so I wouldn't see a reason why we couldn't continue to create significant value. But again, I have to go back to the point that we don't ever have -- we don't ever view ourselves as having been opportunistic in acquisitions. I think our success has been we have identified what we felt were missed price opportunities, that we went and then pursued. So as long as we are able to adhere to that acquisition strategy, I think we can replicate what we have done. Where we would go awry, I think, is if we transacted without that high degree of conviction, that we had a different and better view of value than the market.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "On consumer, Jim, do you have a view to the extent that backlogs have gone out so far, especially within bleached, whether there is a greater than normal, if you will, double booking or preordering has been done? Or do you think it's really reflecting finally a pickup at the consumer level in a good way in terms of demand and what it means for your products? That's question one. Question two, given that the backlogs are greater in bleached than they are for CRB, not trying to get into forward pricing and how effective you think you will be or not, why is the effective data, if I'm not mistaken, on the bleached pricing increase later out in the summer than the CRB index -- CRB price even though CRB has a somewhat lower backlog?", "James A. Rubright", "The answer to the second question is simply a function of when we announced having an effective date that gives your customers the notice that you think is appropriate in circumstances with respect to the particular price increase. So they simply stand on their own relative to the timing that we made the announcements. With respect to the SBS backlogs, at 8 weeks, there will always be some effect of people ordering farther out as they see the need to stretch out their orders. So there is some compounding effect, but it's still well relative. You still have a very strong order book, which we see based on strengthening demand of the limited portion of the overall SBS market that we're a participant in, which is the folding carton market, where, yes, the demand seems to be the driver behind those backlogs.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Wilde from Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes, just have a couple of follow-ons as well. One, Jim, I just wondered, any thoughts on why the China effect that a lot of us had worried about in the boxboard market hasn't shown up?", "James A. Rubright", "I don't know.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "It's something we've all talked about, all of this Chinese boxboard capacity that so many players over there have been building. And just at this point, it doesn't seem to be having any effect on these markets.", "James A. Rubright", "First of all, the U.S. is a pretty contained market itself. So the fact that you've got capacity in China doesn't really speak to the North American market that much. And if you just look at the cost curves of the global competitiveness of Asian capacity imported to the United States, it just doesn't look terribly attractive to me, and I think that's part of the explanation. The second one is there's very strong, essentially, barriers to entry of a foreign competitor coming into the United States because they've got to build the supply chain. And building that supply chain, I think, takes time and commitment. And those are factors that -- I don't know whether they are the factors that have resulted in the effect that you and I have seen, but those are things that we think are structurally part of our market and our relative competitiveness relative to the potential of competition from Asia.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. The other question I had is just you talked about moving the box business towards the Southern Container model. And I just -- I'm kind of curious, if you look at the best margin guy in the business, over time, it's been Packaging Corp., which also runs a lot of these smaller sheet plants. Do you intend to continue to run any small sheet plants or are you going to go strictly to kind of large box plants, kind of high throughput?", "James A. Rubright", "Well, Mark, I have to disagree with your premise that Packaging Corp. had the highest margins in the industry traditionally. In the year before RockTenn acquired Southern Container, Southern Container's EBITDA margins were 40% higher than Packaging Corp's. The margins were 26.4% a year before we acquired Southern Container. So that business model, in fact, was a very highly profitable margin with large, high throughput, very high-performing box plants. Now Southern did, as RockTenn did, also operate some profitable sheet plants, which can address customer segments that don't fit that model. So then the answer to the second question is, yes, we have a profitable sheet feeder business, both sheet feeders that we own and sheet feeders that we joint venture. We have a profitable sheet plant business that we will continue to operate. And we also have the largest capacity in preprint in North America, as you know. So all of those sectors contribute to our model, but the -- in effect, some of those are pretty profitable segments. But the box plant model itself is going to be a box plant model that operates on the basis of very high capacity, very well-capitalized plants. And we have -- you're seeing the results of that. We've taken 20% of the box plant capacity out in terms of number of plants and increased the sales and throughput of the system.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. That's the answer I was looking for, and I stand corrected because I do remember those 30% Southern Container margins. I was just never clear on how much of that was just the mill and how much of that was the converting business.", "James A. Rubright", "Okay. Sure.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Phil Gresh from JPMorgan, you may ask your question.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes, a couple of quick follow-ups. Just On the M&A front, wondering whether you might, at some point, have international aspirations. You've obviously participated in some international markets, but you're largely domestic, so wondering how you think about that today.", "James A. Rubright", "Well, we have defined our principal markets as North America, and we're a large converter in Canada, both in Consumer and in Corrugated Packaging. We have a significant participation in Mexico in corrugated. As you know, Mexico is growing -- our operations are growing at 5% plus, and we need additional capacity in Mexico. We're a large exporter to Central America. It would be an attractive place for us to go. We like South America. We really haven't found the right opportunity in South America. I think we've indicated that we don't see the likelihood of Asia for us. And Europe would be challenged to apply our business model, but I wouldn't rule out Europe as a market for us, given the pull from our customers.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just one final question on cash taxes. Obviously, you had a lot of moving pieces in terms of credits and things like that. Just wondering if you could simplify it for us a little bit and share with us what kind of cash tax rate you're assuming for this year and next year in your free cash flow guidance.", "James A. Rubright", "Cash tax rates, close to 0 this year and in 2014. I think when you run through the NOLs and you're seeing better NOLs, you get out. And just I guess it's probably 16. And then we mentioned the cellulosic box. Credits can only offset 75% of your tax liabilities, so you will start to see some tax liability on a cash tax basis. And we do -- and then based on your state position, we do pay some state taxes, cash taxes now, but it's relatively small compared to the overall income picture.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So is it fair to say kind of low single-digit percent for -- all-in for the next 2 years?", "James A. Rubright", "Yes.", "Operator", "I have no further questions in queue.", "James A. Rubright", "Well, thank you, all very much for joining our call. We'll sign off.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MeadWestvaco Third Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Director of Investor Relations, Jason Thompson. Please go ahead.", "Jason Thompson", "Thanks, Carrie, and good morning, everyone. John Luke, Jim Buzzard and Mark Rajkowski are here to talk about our third quarter results as well as a strategic transaction we announced yesterday afternoon. The notification for this call was broadly disclosed and is being webcast at mwv.com where the slides are also available. Our result and commentary are presented on a continuing operations basis and are correct, as of today, but could include time-sensitive information and are subject to change. In addition, any statements that are forward looking are subject to known and unknown risks and are not guarantees of future performance.", "I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Luke.", "John A. Luke", "Thanks, Jason, and good morning. We have a number of positive developments to discuss with you this morning. We had higher sales and renewed earnings growth during the third quarter, including continued signs that our profitable growth strategy is working and our execution is improving, even as economic conditions soften around the world. We'll get to that in a moment, as I plan to moderate between commentary from both Jim and Mark on the quarter. But first, I'd like to offer a few comments about the agreement with Plum Creek that we announced yesterday afternoon, and then turn to Mark for some additional details on the transaction.", "The agreement we've signed with Plum Creek fulfills all of the strategic objectives we set for a transaction involving our forestland and real estate development business. As we reported in yesterday's press release, we're selling our U.S. forestland and creating a new partnership focused on real estate development in the Charleston, South Carolina region. The total implied value of the transaction is $1.5 billion. We'll receive consideration of approximately $1.1 billion when we closed the deal by the end of this year, and we're evaluating the best options for returning most of the value directly to shareholders.", "Plum Creek is the ideal partner for this unique transaction. Our landholdings fit well in their portfolio and we know that they share our commitment to sustainable development. This will enable us to build an ongoing strategic relationship around our Charleston development activities and long-term fiber supply agreements for our Covington paperboard mill in Virginia.", "When we announced our intention to evaluate options for this business, we laid out several important strategic objectives. And as I said, we have fulfilled them all. First, we've generated maximum value from these assets. The timing is right for the market, the partner is right for the company, the outcome is right for our shareholders. Second, we've preserved as much value as possible by keeping tax efficiency very much in mind. Compared to all of the available options, this transaction minimizes our exposure and immediately delivers significant value to our shareholders. Third, our shareholders will continue to participate in a very attractive upside potential of our well-located development properties in South Carolina, especially the Nexton and East Edisto projects. Ken Seeger and his team have already put the strategies in place for these developments and they will continue to lead the implementation with the backing of the MWV brand in the community. Plum Creek shares our confidence in both our team and development plans, and we look forward to working with them to further the significant opportunities that we have in Charleston.", "Looking ahead, MWV will be even more focused on our core Packaging and Specialty Chemicals businesses. This transaction represents another important step in our deliberate and strategic transformation placing an even greater focus on our participation in the large, growing global Packaging and Specialty Chemicals markets, where we continue to make very good progress", "I'll have a few more comments as part of our report on the third quarter, but first, I want to ask Mark to share some of the financial elements and other details of the Plum Creek transaction. Mark?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Thanks, John. Obviously, we're very excited about this deal. It's a great outcome for our company and for our shareholders. I'll begin by highlighting a few key items, including value creation, use of proceeds and timing.", "The $1.5 billion of implied value from this transaction is very attractive. And we've structured this deal to provide significant tax efficiencies and also to preserve substantial upside potential for our shareholders, as we execute our plans under our new real estate development partnership. This value is higher than the base case valuation we laid out for investors in Charleston a few years ago. Taking into consideration that we've already realized nearly a quarter billion dollars from land sales in the interim and that we're also retaining certain oil and gas rights in West Virginia and a majority of the upside potential in our Charleston development properties.", "As John noted, this transaction will deliver approximately $1.1 billion in consideration to MWV and importantly, preserves almost $150 million of value through tax efficient structures. Taking a closer look at what's included in the agreement, Plum Creek is paying $934 million for 501,000 acres of forestland and some mineral rights or $1,864 per acre. In addition to the U.S. forestland acquisition, Plum Creek will invest in the newly formed partnership comprised of MWV's approximately 109,000 acres of diversified development lands in the Charleston, South Carolina region. Plum Creek will acquire for $152 million in cash, an ownership interest in the partnership, placing an initial implied value of the partnership at approximately $530 million. This attractive valuation reflects the outstanding job Ken Seeger's team has done over the last 6 years to grow the value of these well positioned properties. However, we shared the view with Plum Creek that there is tremendous upside potential in the Charleston region, so we expect to create even more value through this partnership over time. Not included in the agreement are the oil and gas rights on the 191,000 acres located over the Marcellus Shale fairway in West Virginia.", "Given current market pricing for natural gas, valuations for these rights today are low by historical standards and, therefore, selling them now would not be in the best interest of our shareholders. We will continue to work with Bluescape to quantify the gas reserves and of course, we'll periodically evaluate the market for the appropriate opportunity to maximize shareholder value with this asset. We expect to close by the end of this year, at which time, we're estimating we'll have $950 million in net proceeds after taxes and fees. We plan to use about $210 million to pay down the balance on our term loan to ensure we maintain our investment grade rating.", "We'll also use approximately $75 million from the proceeds to fund a new real estate development partnership, which will largely cover the cash needs of the business, until it becomes cash flow positive in 2016. The remaining $665 million of proceeds will be returned to shareholders. With our board and advisors, we'll consider all of our options in optimizing returns for shareholders and we'll make a determination at closing, or sometime shortly thereafter. Furthermore, despite the loss of cash flow from the sale of rural and recreation lands, we expect to maintain the current quarterly dividend rate of $0.25 per share.", "That concludes our comments on the transaction and I'll now turn it back to John to kick off our discussion about the third quarter. John?", "John A. Luke", "Thanks, Mark, and thanks, again, for your leadership in enabling this important transaction. Again, we're pleased with this agreement. It accomplishes all of the objectives we set out at the beginning of this year and it enables us to further focus on accelerating our profitable growth strategy in Packaging and Specialty Chemicals.", "We made good progress in these areas during the third quarter, as well as with other initiatives we've had underway to improve our earnings performance. In terms of our commercial excellence and innovation efforts in both the developed and emerging markets we serve around the world, we're outperforming the broader food and beverage markets with the special value propositions of our high-quality paperboard and we're winning positions with the best positioned brand owners in each industry.", "We're gaining market share in medical plastics, skincare, fragrance and other beauty dispensing categories and we're continuing to accelerate the pace of change in the adherence packaging market for health care.", "We're generating higher prices for our corrugated solutions in Brazil and seeing gains with our new operations in India, despite reduced GDP expectations in both countries. In both of these markets, we're pursuing a steady move toward higher quality corrugated packaging for fresh produce, frozen meat and household goods. And we're continuing to excel in megatrend specialty chemicals markets, including our innovative solutions for automotive emission controls, road paving and energy exploration.", "In addition to this commercial momentum, we also improved our overall operating performance in the third quarter, which had not been up to our standards during the first half of the year. Our productivity improved significantly, and we consistently expanded the quality and capacity of our new paperboard machines in both Brazil and India. We also began the process of bringing our new biomass boiler at Covington online. This will have a positive impact on the bottom line during the fourth quarter. This is the strategic path we've laid out: differentiated participation in our markets, disciplined focus on execution and sound growth investments. Even with the challenging global economic conditions, we expect to further improve our performance in Packaging and Specialty Chemicals as well as close the transaction with Plum Creek as we move through the fourth quarter.", "Now I'd like to turn to Jim for a rundown of the performance in each of our segments. Jim?", "James A. Buzzard", "Thank you, John. Overall, our operational performance improved in the third quarter and contributed to better earnings, especially compared to the first half of this year. Even as macroeconomic conditions have negatively impacted overall demand in similar markets, we are continuing to outperform with our participation strategies and increasingly benefiting from the growth and productivity investments we've made through the downturn. We expect to build on this commercial and operational momentum through the end of the year and deliver meaningful profitable growth in the fourth quarter and into 2014.", "I'll provide a quick overview of each of our segments, with the reminder that detailed information about each business is contained in the slides that accompany this call. In Food & Beverage, we have overcome the operational issues from the second quarter and are running at expected levels with strong backlogs at this point in the fourth quarter. And while overall volumes and pricing were down in the quarter, sequential volume trends and price realizations are both positive.", "Looking at the 2 big markets we serve in this business, we are generally outperforming broader industry trends in both food and beverage with our unique paperboard value propositions and commercial excellent efforts. Our food volumes are up strongly year-over-year compared to a flattish market as we continue to win share with brand owners choosing to replace corrugated and coated recycled board with our innovative lightweight paperboard. And in beverage, our integrated system approach with the leading brand owners, has led to better than market performance in the Americas, Europe and Asia.", "In North America, we're essentially flat in a market that is down for both carbonated soft drinks and canned beer. In Europe, we grew 4% as the market bounced back from poor conditions earlier this year. And in Asia, we continued our strong growth as we partner with our customers to help shape the development of the multi-pack market. And more carton volumes are flowing through the packaging machines we placed with key customers over the past few years.", "Given our momentum in these targeted markets, we expect solid earnings improvement in the fourth quarter driven by volume gains, better pricing and improved manufacturing productivity. Including expected benefits from the new Covington boiler and our paper machine rebuild at Mahrt.", "In Home, Health & Beauty, we are continuing to win market share in the parts of the business we're emphasizing going forward, namely, our plastic pumps and dispensers. Total sales were basically flat in the quarter and earnings were impacted by high resin prices as well as transitory costs associated with the move from folding cartons to plastic dispensers in Brazil.", "Looking at the 3 primary markets we serve in this business, our beauty and personal care dispensing volumes were up more than 10% in the quarter. We're gaining market share in several categories, especially with our fragrance solutions in Europe, as we just launched another line extension of our popular Melodie spray collection.", "We've had very strong volume growth, over 20% in our preservative-free nasal pumps in health care. This is high margin business and we are midway through an expansion of our facility in Germany to serve the growing medical plastics market. We're also continuing to add new branded prescription drugs to our core adherence packaging business with large retailers.", "The home and garden market has been very tough this year with weather and other impacts on the category, and we were essentially flat during the seasonally weak third quarter. We were proud to see our customer Simple Green featured on the cover of Packaging Digest, with our new VersaPlast Trigger Sprayer, which is a key part of our growth strategy in North America.", "In the fourth quarter, we expect a modest profit versus last year's breakeven performance. Volume and pricing gains in targeted segments of the personal care, home and garden and health care markets will be partially offset by higher raw material costs, mainly resin, and transitory costs related to the exit of our Folding Carton business. Given our pipeline of brand launches, innovative new products and our broader emerging market focus, we are confident that performance will improve significantly in 2014.", "Turning to our Industrial Packaging business, we continued to ramp toward full production and commercialization of the growth investments, product enhancements and quality improvements we've made in our corrugated business, in both Brazil and India.", "While we are not yet fully optimized in Brazil, we began to see the expected sales in earnings improvement in the third quarter as the new machine reached target production rates for the first time in September. We expect to continue building on these rates in the fourth quarter and through 2014.", "Looking specifically at our business in each of these 2 geographies. In Brazil, overall economic growth continued at a slow pace and corrugated packaging demand was tepid in the quarter. We focused on protecting our margins, successfully raising prices to offset wage and material inflation. As expected, we lost some box volume due to these price increases, as well as from the sale of our Feira de Santana box plant. But we expect to win some of the business back as customers assimilate to higher prices and appreciate our quality and service compared with the competition. The paperboard markets are showing excellent receptivity for the lightweight container board from our new machine, and this is nicely offsetting the corrugated market softness.", "In India, we are ramping up the new paper machine and starting conversations with customers and box users to help lead the market toward adoption of higher-quality corrugated packaging. We see significant opportunity to help transition the market to value performance-based packaging, which our business is well suited to provide.", "In the fourth quarter, we expect a significant dollar-based earnings growth in the Industrial segment. On a local currency basis, we expect to more than double last year's profit in Brazil with modest corrugated volume growth and continued pricing gains, as well as productivity improvement at our expanded Tres Barras mill. Earnings in India are expected to be neutral to segment earnings as we continue to ramp up that business.", "In Specialty Chemicals, sales and earnings both increased compared to last year's record quarter. There were some one-off benefits that offset a competitive market for some of our standard pine chemicals products. These pressures are stabilized and our momentum in this business continues to be very strong. We benefited from the acquisition of the Resitec pine chemicals business in Brazil and continue to solidify and extend our positions in the automotive carbon, asphalt paving, energy exploration and adhesives markets. In particular, our warm mix asphalt additive, Evotherm, performed very well in the third quarter even as government spending on infrastructure has been declining around the world. Also, new vehicle sales in the U.S., a key driver of our carbon business, continued to strengthen and next year, are estimated to reach a level not seen since 2006.", "In the fourth quarter, we expect solid earnings growth in Specialty Chemicals. We expect the sequential pricing trends for our standard, pine chemicals products to stabilize or improve, but there will still be a very difficult comparison to last year.", "We also expect continued volume gains in asphalt, adhesives, oilfield and automotive markets as well as improved productivity. However, a recent production interruption of our Charleston facility will partially offset these gains by about $2 million to $3 million.", "I'm not going to talk much about Community Development and Land Management. The story there is, obviously, the transaction with Plum Creek. However, CDLM did have a very strong performance with land sales during the third quarter, which was a significant driver of the overall company's sales and earnings improvement.", "Now I'll turn over to Mark for his comments on the financial performance during the third quarter. Mark?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Thanks, Jim. I'll quickly cover our third quarter financial results and then provide our outlook for the fourth quarter.", "Despite continued macroeconomic challenges and emerging market volatility, we feel good about our sales progress, renewed earnings growth and the solid cash performance for the quarter. We expect to continue this trajectory through the current quarter and into 2014.", "Sales increased 3% in the quarter, largely due to the addition of Ruby Macons and Resitec businesses, higher land sales and improved pricing and mix, particularly in the Industrial business in Brazil. The higher pricing and lower overall consumption in Brazil had a negative impact on corrugated volumes, which we expected. Our total packaging volumes were also down during the quarter, with gains in retail food, aseptic packaging and personal care dispensers more than offset by the timing of some tobacco shipments and lower food service volumes as we continue to ramp up a new solution with a major customer. Unfavorable foreign exchange, primarily in Brazil, also reduced sales by about 1% during the quarter.", "Adjusted EBIT increased 25% to $179 million. Higher land sales and pension income accounted for a large portion of the year-over-year earnings growth in the quarter. However, much improved operational execution during the quarter, resulted in better manufacturing productivity at all our facilities. This, along with continued reductions in overhead costs, helped offset the impacts of higher input costs and wage inflation, as well as lower volume absorption during the quarter.", "We generated approximately $12 million in additional overhead savings during the third quarter, which brings our total for the year to $28 million and puts us in a position to deliver above our expected range of $25 million to $30 million of savings for 2013. These savings have also contributed to reducing SG&A as a percentage of sales by 60 basis points in the quarter.", "Cash flow from operations improved to $148 million in the third quarter. This brings our cash flow from operations to $260 million year-to-date, which is double the year ago amount of $127 million. We expect to finish the year with positive free cash flow, excluding the major capital investments of about $200 million.", "Our cash on hand has declined approximately $200 million since the beginning of the year largely reflecting the investments in our large capital projects, primarily the Covington biomass boiler, which successfully started up this month.", "We expect to be within our anticipated range for CapEx this year, roughly $500 million to $525 million, and our current view of 2014 CapEx remains $375 million to $400 million.", "Now I'll turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect significant earnings improvement versus the prior year in each of our manufacturing segments, largely driven by productivity gains and lower overhead costs. We also expect higher overall volume and improved price mix in our Targeted Packaging and Specialty Chemicals end markets. With the expected close of the Plum Creek transaction in the current year, we will report fourth quarter results from CDLM's forestry and rural land activities, as discontinued operations. As a result, we expect a small loss related to development activities in the fourth quarter.", "Looking to 2014. Our forecasted full year EBITDA for CDLM was approximately $90 million. The loss of CDLM's earnings impacts our ability to achieve a $1.2 billion EBITDA goal we set at the end of 2011. In addition, we've experienced significant unfavorable currency translations and sluggish growth in our markets since 2011. We expect these trends to continue through next year. As a result, we're adjusting our outlook for EBITDA performance in 2014 to a range of $950 million to $1 billion.", "Now I'll turn it back to John.", "John A. Luke", "Mark, thanks very much. We've covered a lot today, with major focus on the news about our forestland and real estate business. As we move toward closing the transaction at Plum Creek and continuing to improve the performance of our Packaging and Specialty Chemicals businesses, we're creating significant value for our shareholders.", "Our growth strategies are working and our operating performance has improved and stabilized. Good signs for a significant improvement in earnings and cash flow during the fourth quarter, solid momentum heading into next year.", "This concludes the remarks we had prepared for review with you this morning and we'd now be happy to answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go to the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So just starting there, I just wanted to delve into a little bit kind of what's left. Obviously, you talked about some of the costs you're going to be incurring in that business to achieve the future upside you see there. Can you talk about how you see that kind of monetization layering in, over time, given that you don't expect to be cash flow positive until 2016? Do you expect that, essentially, you're not going to kind of monetize anything until that point or are there kind of mile markers you might be able to achieve between now and then?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Phil, yes, let me take that one. We do expect to generate cash flows from a number of different transactions over the next couple of years. So we will be -- we expect to be selling some properties at good value but we'll also be continuing to make some investments in the development projects that we have, particularly in our one JV, that is more near in development, includes Nexton as well as a couple of number of other projects. So we're still in the, I would say, the earlier stages of the development process, but expect to be monetizing certain properties along the way.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got it, okay. And then on industrial, my question there is if I look at last year's bridge, you had about $6 million of headwinds from the projects. So if I think about this year's third quarter, as we lapped that $6 million in cost, I guess I would have expected the net productivity to kind of have, at least, that add back and then potentially, the kicking in of some of the savings. It sounds like you're kind of hitting the full run rate towards the end of the quarter but maybe could you just help me understand kind of what's driving that continued headwind relative to last year's comps?", "John A. Luke", "Jim, you want to take that up?", "James A. Buzzard", "Sure, Phil. We do have a variety of things going on. As you noted, we did reach the targeted production levels in September of this last quarter. So the team has made tremendous progress through the course of this year and we're optimistic, not only about having reached the targeted levels but the opportunity we see to go beyond those levels as we go forward. So really good results from the team. In terms of some of the things that impacted us during the quarter, we had a significant maintenance outage, which we didn't really outlook to you, but that represented probably $3 million to $3.5 million just in maintenance and services costs. In addition, we lost the absorption and other things from the downtime related to that, normal sort of maintenance. We're also taking advantage to fix some of the things that we've identified through the course of the ramp-up and put all those together and took the mill down to take care of that. We also had some FX that hit us and then, we have seen some cost pressure in areas like OCC and others. But the real key for us going forward is now that we've got to the target levels, now it's beating the optimization and we've got a great team down there. As I said, we have a lot of confidence in what that product is going to deliver for us. And so we're very optimistic as we look to Q4 in 2014 in Brazil.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Mark, last question just as, as with the guidance on 2014, how do you think about the productivity across the businesses that layer in to help you reach that target. Anyway you could quantify those far us?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Well, yes, Phil. I recall we did have some challenges that we had to work through the first half of this year. So there's going to be substantial snapback from that. Certainly, we're going to see significant benefits, as Jim just mentioned, now that we've achieved that targeted capacity in September. We're going to go from there, continue to ramp that up so there'll be substantial operating productivity that we'll see in Brazil. So -- and we've also got benefits from our investment in the Covington boiler. And importantly, we're continuing to make great progress on taking out overhead costs. So that's going to be a fairly substantial contributor to our next year's earnings growth.", "James A. Buzzard", "And the only thing I might add, Phil, is, I think, as we noted, we had a big rebuild at our Mahrt mill. Team did a great job coming up from that outage and we see some benefits with the new products coming out of there in 2014 as well. So as Mark said, good opportunity from both snapback, as well as our investments in ongoing operating excellence to drive productivity in '14.", "Operator", "And next we'll go to the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Mark Rajkowski, is it possible to give us some sense of what type of investment dollars are going to be required in the real estate development side over the next 2 or 3 years?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, as we -- as I outlooked in my comments, we are setting aside approximately $75 million of the proceeds from the transaction to fund what really will be the lion's share of cash required to continue the -- to execute on our development plan. So as we get through those first 2 years, where the development is a little bit heavier than the cash we're bringing in from the land sales, we expect to be fully self-funding by year 3.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So just so I'm clear about this, so you may be spending more than the $75 million because you're also -- you may be doing some land sales within one or both of the ventures, is that right?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Well, yes. I mean, it's -- I look at it as -- it's like a checkbook where you got cash inflows and cash outflows. But at the end of the day, we'll be net cash positive in the third year. So obviously, there's going to be -- we're going to be generating some proceeds from sales of properties and we're going to be spending development. It might be -- your math is correct. I mean, it will be more than $75 million, but that's partially offset by sales of properties.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. Next question is, down in Brazil, and Rigesa, I wonder if it\u2019s possible for you guys to give us a number that would just be Rigesa, and would be backing out Ruby Macons, just in terms of EBITDA and EBITDA margin down there?", "John A. Luke", "Mark, you've got that.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, Mark, we, looking at Rigesa alone for the quarter, EBIT was around 16% and EBITDA was 23%.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. All right. Well, that's good improvement then. And I noticed Ruby [ph] was up the other day with 35%, is that still a reasonable target for you guys?", "John A. Luke", "Mark, I think, as they clearly have a different mix of businesses than we have, certainly with their sack craft and some of the container -- carton board business. But clearly, we see upside to the numbers that Mark gave you and we certainly would aspire to be in the upper 20s to low 30s, for sure.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then, Jim, just the segment I continue to find the most disappointing is kind of Home, Health & Beauty. And I know that you've got some loss-making business in there. But when I look at it, you've just done $17 million year-to-date in EBIT, then if we back out the FX in the third quarter, only about $4 million and, if I just go back and I look at kind of Maybank plus Calmar plus Spray Plast, the Polytop, you\u2019ve put a lot of capital into that business, can you just help us understand how much of a drag these losing businesses are in performance right now, what the underlying business is doing?", "James A. Buzzard", "Sure, Mark. I mean, there's lots of moving parts that go into Q3 but if I look at just the Folding Carton businesses and both in terms of the losses as well as the transition costs that we talked about, that was probably $2 million to $3 million in the third quarter. In addition, we have seen the impact of a fairly dramatic increases in resin. As you know, our businesses are tied to contracts. Those contracts lag anywhere from 3 to 6 months. So we have that impact as a drag on us as well. And then I think as we look going forward and as I referenced, we've seen a lot of opportunity for good improvement in 2014. Our efforts in Brazil with the re-purposing and the growth we're seeing there in the plastics business, gives us a lot of confidence that we'll see dramatic improvement down in South America as well.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And my final question is just the fourth quarter comments, with the year-over-year comparison for the fourth quarter, would that include the $0.07 to $0.10, last year, that had, I think, about $23 million of real estate gains in it?", "John A. Luke", "Yes.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, Mark.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So the net, if you're saying you're going to lose a little bit in development in the fourth quarter, so just the drag there would be about $27 million to $28 million, is that correct?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "That's roughly right.", "Operator", "And next we'll go to the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I guess, you touched on it a little bit, but can you give us more -- a little bit more color and update on where you stand in terms of the natural gas opportunities. Have they started building the pipeline at all and is anything been proven yet?", "John A. Luke", "We've had some testing of a number of wells but -- and the quality has been very good. But the entire build out has slowed down a little bit because of the pressure from lower pricing. So that has taken a bit of a stall. But based upon the work done to date, we really -- we think we've got some nice assets there.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And in terms of the bridge for 2014, can you help us think about the paperboard price increases that were announced this year and how that might affect next year? Just from what you know, given the timing of the contract?", "James A. Buzzard", "Sure. Gail, as you know, we're in the throes of implementing those price increases and I think as we've talked, historically, our business is about 50% contract and 50% non-contract. So we have moved pricing on a non-contract business. We've seen sequential improvements as we came out of Q2 into Q3. We would expect as these contracts come due to move pricing on those. So we will see pricing improvement through Q4 and into 2014 as well.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. But I mean -- but is it fair to say kind of more than half would be reflecting '14 versus '13, just given timing?", "James A. Buzzard", "Sure. I think in terms of both, when the contracts come due and the fact we've moved these prices throughout 2013, I think your assumption is correct.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, and just 2 last quick ones. I thought there was a reference in the press release that there's some onetime gains that impacted the third quarter and chemicals. Could you discuss that and also maybe quantify the impact of the delayed shipments in tobacco, which I presume would benefit the fourth quarter?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, let me -- you want me to take the chemicals piece of that, Jim? Yes, we had some benefits from a business interruption insurance related to an explosion or fire that we had a number of quarters back. So that was roughly $2 million to $3 million and then, we had another $2 million plus for a legal settlement.", "James A. Buzzard", "And then, Gail, on the question of the tobacco shipments at the end of the quarter. As you know, we have a very strong position in the export market. It was simply timing where the vessel was not sailing until early in Q4 for some shipments to Asia. So we'll recognize those this quarter.", "Operator", "And next we'll go to the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Jim, just to clarify on your contracted versus non-contracted for paperboard, does that ratio vary substantially between food, beverage and tobacco, as you think about the very thin markets? And also what was the phase end, in terms of timing on a monthly basis, during the third quarter, because I would assume that they expected the pricing curve to be little bit more favorable than it was?", "James A. Buzzard", "In terms of the contracts, it varies by marketplace. So certainly, in a market like the tobacco market, we have a higher percentage that would be -- it would be under contract. In our food business, it\u2019ll be somewhat less than the 50%. But again, it's going to vary by market and the average though as I said stays at about 50% or so. And in terms of the timing through the quarter, I don't really have a feel for you, in terms of what percent came each month of the third quarter, but it -- it just continued to build on itself and we continue to move pricing, as I've said feel good as we come into Q4, with further implementation and, certainly, as contracts come due towards the end of this year, early next year for their opportunities.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay, and then on the Specialty Chemicals business, you talked about some weakness in pine chemicals and you said it was sort of stabilizing as you looked out at the fourth quarter. Can you just provide some more insight there as to what's going on?", "James A. Buzzard", "Sure. In the chemicals business, there's a variety of raw materials that impacts some of the more standard products. So we have seen, through the course of 2013, falling off of gum prices coming from Asia, so that's impacted the bottom end of our markets. That began to stabilize in Q3. And so we've seen less pressure. But I think the real story for that business is, we have great innovative products that provide a lot of value for our customers, we're participating in those megatrend markets we've talked about in terms of oil and gas exploration, growth in automobiles, infrastructure growth as well. So the markets are strong. We've got great products and we participate in a lot of the emerging markets. So we continue to see a lot of opportunity for that business to perform well going forward.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then, John, maybe one last one for you. So obviously you kind of reshaped the portfolio over the past few years, 2 years ago you announced the sale of the Office Products business and now essentially divesting land, how should we think about the residual business in terms of Specialty Chemicals that you sort of further align with packaging over time in terms of the timeline?", "John A. Luke", "I think for all of the reasons that Jim and Mark have indicated, Ghansham, we're very enthusiastic about the opportunities in Specialty Chemicals. We've got very attractive niche positions and we would look to expand those selectively as we go forward to have our shareholders benefit from the very attractive profitability that we see, that exists and will exist over time, and we see that as a very nice compliment to the strong global packaging business that we have.", "Operator", "And next we'll go to the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Even if I set aside the CDLM business, it seems that you just reduced the 2014 EBITDA target by about $110 million to $160 million, obviously a pretty -- a big move. How much of that order of magnitude would be Brazil versus maybe what you're seeing in Food & Beverage or Home, Health & Beauty, and presumably, Specialty Chemicals isn't a big source of the change, would that be true?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Mark, I think when you look at the original target of $1.2 billion, a big chunk of it, obviously, is CDLM. The big chunk of it was FX. I mean, we -- there was a significant hit we've taken across our businesses, particularly in Brazil and into a lesser extent in our European business, from FX. And I think the rest of that is a combination of things. The economy has been a little bit more sluggish than we'd like. Obviously, you want to grow your business faster, as fast as you can but with tougher end markets, it makes it a little bit more challenging. So it really -- when you look at Brazil in terms of where we're at on the ramp and what we expected on the local currency basis, we're pretty much in line. So a lot -- obviously, CDLM is the biggest chunk. FX impact isn't too far away in terms of order of magnitude and the rest is just a little bit of sluggishness in the overall economy.", "John A. Luke", "Yes. I think, I mean, Mark you've summed it up well. I think, Mark, you can be sure that we'll be looking very hard to meet or exceed the target, but with the focus that you and others have had on this important metric, we just wanted to make the adjustments in expectations on this call, following the CDLM announcement.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay. And so to recap it, it sounds like FX, excuse me, would have been about how much of the $110 million, $160 million, is that about $80 million or so, by your estimation?", "James A. Buzzard", "That's roughly right.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay. And so then, the balance of $30 million to $80 million additional would be largely volume driven?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "I would say, commercial-related volume, a little slower markets and it's hard to pin that on any one single item.", "Operator", "And next we'll go to the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.", "Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "So thank you, for spelling out the general plan for proceeds so that we don't have to guess. But your balance sheet is also still in pretty good shape. So is it safe to assume that for now, we're not going to see any more big M&A and that the reinvestment cycle, now that Brazil and Covington are done, is more or less complete?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, Mark, I think that's a fair statement. We've invested a fair amount in our business over the last 2 to 3 years. And both internal greenfield capital -- CapEx, as well as some bolt-on acquisitions. But I think while we'll continue to look for opportunities to create value, both through growing our business organically, and bolt-on acquisitions, the focus clearly in 2014 and beyond is to really leverage and optimize the investments that we've made.", "John A. Luke", "And I think, I would just add, I think Mark has said that well, we see significant opportunity to do just that in each of our markets.", "Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And just a follow-on to that, over the last couple of years, you've talked about wanting to have a dividend story that was a dividend growth story, is that still important to MeadWestvaco and its boardroom [ph]?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes. I mean, dividends follow earnings and cash flow. So we want to be in a position where we can consistently grow our earnings and cash flows, which supports the ability to provide more consistent returns, growing returns, to our shareholders.", "Operator", "And next we'll go to the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I want to piggyback on Mark's question. So would it be fair to say then, that the direction of the regular quarterly dividend would be more driven by what improvement you see in the operation on a going-forward basis? Or, and will be less affected by the proceeds you receive or might the proceeds that you'll be receiving allow you to raise the regular dividend?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "I think you really want to look at your fundamental underlying business in operations and cash flows. And that's really what we look at. We have a policy where we look to pay out 40% to 60% of our cash flow, after CapEx. And you want to be in a position where you can do that. Over the last couple of years because of the heavy capital spend on some of these projects you've really been above that rate. But certainly have felt that, that was a little bit artificial and the fundamental business still had the ability to support the level of dividend that we're paying. And as you saw in today's announcement, despite the loss of a pretty substantial chunk of EBITDA, in cash, we've got great confidence in our ability to continue to grow our core businesses and maintain that dividend. But we're not satisfied with that. We want to continue to grow earnings and cash flow so we can support increasing returns to our shareholders.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Thanks for that, Mark. Next question I had, you mentioned you expect significant improvement -- Home, Health & Beauty, and that's obviously, been a segment we've talked a lot about in our Q&A with you over the last few quarters and years. Is it possible to quantify, at this juncture, if you hold input costs flat, hold currency flat, what kind of improvement would be significant to you for '14 and, similar question, piggybacking I think on something that Phil had asked earlier, you have -- you're doing a great job on the cost reduction program. You're ahead of schedule. You have Mahrt coming back up. You're done with the ramp-up in Rigesa that continues, what do you think you have as a controllable improvement to earnings for next year versus '13. Could you quantify either of those?", "John A. Luke", "Before jumping to the details of your question, George, let me just say, at the outset, that, obviously, there have been a lot of questions about this and we understand and view them as justifiable. We have a new leader in place, as we've talked before, Pete Durette, whose providing excellent strategic leadership for that business and one of the things that we would intend to do early in 2014, is have an investor event where we can provide a much greater degree of transparency to that business that you raise questions about, what has been a drag in the past, but most importantly, give you a strong sense of the opportunities that Pete and his team see before us.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And in terms of trying to quantify anything at this juncture you would like to hold up until '14 then?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "I think what John said is absolutely the right approach. And we can give you a better view at that point in time.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "All right, my last question, I'll turn it over. Obviously, again, the timberland transaction is certainly a positive. Again, it's been something you've been working on for a while, but it's also been a business that, over the years, has been a shock absorber of sorts for the company relative -- whatever trend you might be seen in the manufacturing business. So now, that it's going to be gone and you're not going to have that level of earnings and cash flow, what changes should we see, if any, from the investment community in terms of how MeadWestvaco further makes its manufacturing businesses, its ongoing recurring businesses more effective, more urgently run and so on?", "John A. Luke", "George, I think, overall, we're operating with greater discipline. I think some of the wake ups we had earlier this year reinforced to us the imperative of operating productively and efficiently, and this is going to be also well served by execution of the market-based strategies we have, which are focused on much greater participation and more stable, more attractive markets over time.", "Operator", "And next we'll go to the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "You all discussed new capacity and then box board in China I think has largely already come online or at least that initial wave. Can you talk about if you\u2019ve seen any impacts from that new capacity in China that\u2019s come online on your export business and when do you think there may be any impact on the business in 2014?", "James A. Buzzard", "Alex, let me comment, at a high level. I think as we've talked on a pretty consistent basis, we've worked very hard, just building on my last response to George's question to build positions in much more stable specialized markets that can bring much greater return to our bottom line and in turn, to our shareholders. And particular, in the board side, we've focused on liquid packaging, tobacco, among others. We're clearly aware of what has been happening in China. Our positions have -- as we've shaped our positions, we've not been impacted in any way but it's uncertain what 2014 is going to hold as a lot of that capacity comes on, not only online but is brought to the marketplace. But our best defense is a strong offense, which is execution of the market strategies that we have in place.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then, on the CapEx spend of, I believe, $375 million to $400 million, $375 million to $400 million for '14, I believe, that would be above your maintenance capital for the business? If that's the case, can you just talk about where the growth capital would be targeted towards in '14?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, we have, as we mentioned in past quarters, made investments in Brazil, with the acquisition of Resitec, and India, with the acquisition of Ruby Macons, and the -- an important part of those business cases is the capacity expansion and improvements. And so that's -- that would be 2 examples of areas where we're investing for growth. We have opportunities in our Medical Plastics business. We've got great opportunities, as Jim pointed out in his comments, related to the growth that we're seeing in fragrance, and some of our other pumps and dispensers products. And a big part of our transformation around our -- the exit of the folding carton business is not just the exit through -- via sale in Europe, which is moving along. But also, the re-purposing of our folding carton operations and some investment in capital to do that, to really grow our pumps and dispensers business, beauty and personal care business in Brazil. So those are some examples of where we're very excited and focused in terms of growing our business.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And one just last quick one, you talked about some corrugated packaging in the U.S. moving to your lighter weight paperboard solutions, can you maybe put a little more color around what product lines are shifting and sort of what the runway is, going forward, for the conversions away from corrugated to your solutions?", "James A. Buzzard", "Sure, Alex. What we're seeing is our high strength paperboard out of Mahrt, so our CUK, really displacing corrugated applications in things like food and beverage. So some of the larger quantity glass packaging that has been in corrugated, over time, is moving to our product. We're also seeing it in some of the multi-pack for some of the food products as well. So we would expect where that value solution is playing to continue to make those changes. It's good for us and it's good for our customers as well.", "Operator", "And we'll go to the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.", "Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just a question on the costs savings, you've got this $75 million goal by the end of 2014. Just wondering what the key metrics that you're following around that. When I compare you to the rest of my coverage universe here, you\u2019re high on SG&A as a percentage of sales but that could be a function of my coverage universe, so maybe you could also align who would be best-in-class and then what the effect also is of the sale of the -- your timberlands business on SG&A?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, Paul, the -- so we're tough -- we are a tough compare because we do have a number of different businesses that have business models, which have -- require different SG&A structures. So what we have in Food & Beverage is very different from what we need in beauty personal care, healthcare different -- they're both different from what we need in Specialty Chemicals. What we're focused on is really getting as lean and as efficient in our overhead costs. And some of those costs, whether they're at corporate or in some of our businesses, as we take them out, part of it gets book capped or accounted for in SG&A. Some of that gets charged to cost of goods sold. So we're continuously looking at how we can be best-in-class, okay, relative to our peers and competitors in those different spaces that we participate in. And we're going to be relentless in our pursuit of that.", "Jason Thompson", "Okay, Carrie, can you please give the replay information out to everyone and we'll talk to you all next quarter. Thank you.", "John A. Luke", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay starting today at 12 noon and going through November 29 at 12 midnight.

My name is Crystal. I will be your conference operator for today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the RockTenn Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]", "As a reminder, slides are being presented today as part of the conference call. These slides can be accessed at www.rocktenn.com under the Investors page. Ladies and gentlemen, this call is being recorded today, November 5, 2013. [Operator Instructions]", "Your speakers for today's call are Mr. Steve Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Ward Dickson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Voorhees, you may begin your conference.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Thanks, Crystal. Thank you all for joining our call. This is Steve Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer. I'm joined this morning by Ward Dickson, Chief Financial Officer; Jim Porter, President of our Corrugated Packaging business; Mike Kiepura, President of our Consumer Packaging and Recycling businesses.", "This is the first quarterly earnings call since 2000 that I'm not sitting with Jim Rubright. So I think you are all aware, Jim retired from RockTenn last week. Jim guided RockTenn's exceptional business performance and financial results over the past 14 years. When he joined RockTenn, our sales were $1.3 billion, RockTenn's stock price was $14 per share and our equity market capitalization was $500 million. Today, RockTenn's sales are $9.5 billion, our stock price is $109 per share and our equity market capitalization is approximately $8 billion.", "During Jim's tenure as RockTenn's CEO, total shareholder return including dividends was 863% for a 17.4% compound annual rate of return. This is an exceptional result. Jim's going to be missed as a mentor, as a colleague and as a friend to us all, and we wish him the best.", "Before I turn to our review of the business for the quarter, I need to review our cautionary statements. During the course of the call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discuss. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent 10-Qs and our Fiscal 2012 10-K.", "Also, during the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation. The slide presentation is available on our website.", "I'm going to begin with the discussion of our operating results during the quarter. Then Ward Dickson will turn -- will discuss our input costs, balance sheet, pension and other financial measures. I'm going to discuss our capital allocation strategy and outlook. We will then be available for your questions.", "Our coworkers continued to make solid progress in improving all aspects of our business and delivered strong financial results during the quarter. We established a RockTenn record for quarterly adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted fourth quarter earnings of $2.66 per share increased by $1.27, 91% over last year. These results reflect strong operating performance, higher pricing and continued productivity improvements, partially offset by higher commodity cost.", "Our Corrugated Packaging segment EBITDA was up strongly over the last year. EBITDA margins in our Corrugated segment were 20%, an increase from 17.3% in the June quarter and 13.7% in the September quarter of last year. Included in our results are the following items: first, a pre-tax gain of $12 million related to recording additional value for spare parts at the containerboard mills acquired in the Smurfit-Stone acquisition; second, a $9 million gain net of start-up expenses related to a terminated steam supply contract at the Solvay Mill; and third, an $8 million gain related to a partial insurance settlement of property damage claims associated with the turbine generator failure at our Demopolis Mill in May of 2012.", "As background, the failed turbine generator was originally built in the 1950s with a capacity of 17 megawatts. The replacement turbine generator has capacity of 35 megawatts. The additional capacity improves the economics of the upcoming $68 million fluidized bed boiler project at Demopolis. We discussed this project on our July call. The project will provide an attractive return while addressing the Boiler MACT requirements at the mill.", "Our effective book tax rate of 30.6% was favorably impacted by various state and international tax items. Our effective book tax rate was 31% in the prior-year quarter.", "Our higher earnings drove record quarterly free cash flow available for dividends, pension contributions in excess of expense and debt reduction. Free cash flow totaled $277 million, or $3.78 per share in the quarter. This was $2.02 greater than the $1.76 per share in the prior-year quarter. Free cash flow of $11.16 per share in fiscal '13 was 55% higher than the $7.18 per share in fiscal '12. Net debt reduction was $176 million in the quarter and $567 million for the full year. Our leverage ratio of 1.95x at September 30 is below 2 for the first time since March of '11, the quarter immediately preceding the completion of the Smurfit-Stone acquisition.", "Turning to our Corrugated Packaging business. Industry box volumes, as reported by the Fiber Box Association on a per day basis, increased by 0.6% in the September quarter compared to the prior-year quarter, and 0.6% over the June quarter.", "Industry inventory levels increased to 2.4 million tons at the end of September, up from 2.2 million tons at the end of June and 2.1 million tons in September of last year. Industry operating rates for the quarter averaged 97% compared to 96% 1 year ago and 97% in the June quarter. Industry operating rates were 98.6% in July, 99.7% in August and 93.8% in September.", "RockTenn's inventory has increased by 38,000 tons in the quarter. This is in line with the 25,000- to 50,000-ton increase that we anticipated on our last investor call. We reacted to our customer demand during the quarter by reducing production by 60,000 tons, allowing us to better match our supply with our customer demand. 50,000 of the 60,000 tons of reduced production was taken in the month of September. Much of this reduction was necessary because of our higher productive capacity, resulting from productivity improvements in the containerboard mill system over the past 2 years.", "Industry shipments of containerboard to export markets declined by 9% from the prior-year quarter, and declined by 3% from the June quarter. RockTenn's export shipments increased 12% over the June quarter. Our shipments increased in Latin America, Europe and the Middle East. Our average export price declined by $11 per ton compared to the June quarter. Compared to the prior-year quarter, our export containerboard shipments declined by 3% and our average price increased by $83 per ton.", "In the September quarter, we averaged $50 -- $54 per ton of incremental pricing from the April containerboard price increase. RockTenn's FBA equivalent per day box shipments for the quarter increased by 0.5% over the prior year, in line with the industry increase of 0.6%.", "During the past 12 months, from October of '12 to September of '13, our FBA equivalent per day box shipments increased by 2.6% compared to the industry increase of 0.2%.", "Corrugated Packaging segment EBITDA for the September quarter was $349 million. This was $130 million higher than last year. Prices increased by $178 million over last year, domestic corrugated box and board prices increased by $106 per ton or $158 million.", "Export containerboard sales accounted for $21 million or $90 per ton. And pulp prices were lower by $19 per ton or $1 million compared to the prior-year quarter. Our volume variance over last year was a negative $11 million, primarily due to the production reductions we took in our mill system.", "Moving to input cost. Absent the impact of synergies and performance improvements, recovered fiber prices and wood prices would have increased by $34 million; chemical, energy and freight cost would have increased by approximately $33 million; and labor, SG&A and other expenses would have increased by $23 million, but for the $52 million in synergies and performance improvements, across our integrated corrugated box and mill system.", "Our natural gas conversion projects have continued to deliver the expected financial results. The new Solvay natural gas boiler started up in late September, and allowed us to terminate the long-standing contract with the third-party that supplied coal-fired steam to the mills.", "Since the completion of the Smurfit-Stone acquisition, we've completed 5 natural gas projects at Stevenson, West Point, Hopewell, Fernandina Beach and Solvay. Over the last 2.5 years, we have invested approximately $33 million in these 5 natural gas conversion projects, and we're capturing annual savings of approximately $47 million.", "At the end of September, RockTenn operated 91 corrugated container plants in North America. We've closed 20 container plants since we acquired Smurfit-Stone, and we are now operating 8 fewer plants than we operated in the same quarter 1 year ago. This is consistent with our strategy of operating larger, more efficient box plants.", "Our average volumes per plant during the September quarter were 7% higher than last year. Improved product quality, better operational performance and higher customer satisfaction continued to be the highest priorities for our box plant system.", "We reduced waste by 42 basis points compared to the prior-year quarter. We've continued to roll out our new box plant operating system. To-date, we've implemented the new operating system in 34 box plants and continue to expect to complete the rollout in fiscal '14.", "We will install new modern flexo folder gluers in 6 of our box plants during fiscal '14. We currently operate 6 of these new units in our box plants and have achieved significant productivity and quality increases at each location. The new flexos, manufactured by Mitsubishi, will replace between 2 and 4 existing flexos in each of the box plants where they will be installed.", "Moving to current corrugated market conditions. We are seeing some softness in both domestic and export corrugated and containerboard markets. Our recycled containerboard mill in Jacksonville, called Seminole, is our swing facility that we use as one of our primary levers in balancing our containerboard production with our end customer demand.", "On November 1, this was last Friday, we temporarily idled 1 of our 2 machines at the Seminole mill. The machine we idled is a 200,000-ton per year machine that produces medium. We continue to operate the second machine, which is capable of producing 400,000 tons per year of a combination of linerboard and medium.", "We are also reducing our current mill production to meet current customer demand at several of our other facilities, and we will increase production back to normal levels as our customer demand improves.", "We've scheduled major maintenance outages at our Florence and Fernandina Beach mills in the December quarter. With respect to the inventory levels, we intentionally increased inventory levels during the past year to better serve our customer base, to improve delivery times and to reduce additional transportation costs. We're at a good base inventory level now. We will still build inventories as we head into our maintenance outages, then consume those higher inventories during the outage cycles.", "Turning to our Consumer Packaging segment. SBS industry backlogs as of October 23 were 565,000 tons, up approximately 75% from the 326,000 tons at the end of December. Backlogs have remained in the 560,000- to 600,000-ton range since the beginning of July.", "RockTenn's SBS backlogs now stand at 6 weeks. PPW increased SBS pricing by $25 per ton during the quarter and $60 per ton during the last 2 quarters. We expect the contractual realization of these price increases will be complete by January -- by July of '14.", "CRB industry backlogs as of October 23 were 163,000 tons. This is up 26% from the 129,000 tons reported 1 year ago. RockTenn's CRB backlogs now stand at 4.5 weeks. PPW increased CRB pricing by $40 per ton during the quarter, and $75 per ton during the last 2 quarters. We also expect the contractual realization of these price increases to be complete by July of '14.", "Sales volumes of our converted products of folding cartons and interior packaging were 5.3 billion square feet during the quarter, up approximately 1.5% from last year. Sales increased by 1.3% over the prior year and would've been higher, but for the flow-through of lower paperboard prices over the past year.", "Our Consumer Packaging mills and converting facilities operated well during the quarter. We took no economic downtime at any of our mills. Our specialty paperboard and merchandising displays businesses operated and performed very well. Adjusted for last year's litigation settlement, total segment sales in the fourth quarter were up 4.7% as compared to last year.", "Our reported Consumer Packaging business segment income of $89 million in the September quarter increased by $13 million over the June quarter, and declined by $10 million compared to the prior-year quarter.", "Last year's segment income included a one-time item of $18 million, received in connection with the termination and settlement of a paperboard supply agreement. This year's September quarter included an $8 million gain related to the insurance settlement previously discussed.", "From a mill ton standpoint, recycled paperboard and pulp shipments were up in the quarter, as compared to last year. And SBS shipments were down 5,000 tons, which is in line with our production for the quarter.", "Our merchandising displays business achieved record sales and income in the September quarter. New business and promotional activities strengthened as the quarter progressed. We see continued growth opportunities in our merchandising displays business.", "Beginning in the December quarter, we will report the merchandising displays business as its own segment, separate from the Consumer Packaging segment. And to help with your modeling, we expect to file an 8-K sometime before the end of the December quarter, which will provide the realigned historical segment sales and segment income for our businesses.", "In fiscal '13, merchandising displays sales were approximately $675 million and operating income was $64 million. Comparing this year to last year's September quarter, pricing increases for SBS, URB and pulp grades were partially offset by slightly lower CRB and folding carton pricing. CRB, URB and SBS and market pulp prices increased sequentially as we implemented previous price increases through our converting system, and sold board tons at higher prices.", "Even though November and December historically represent the low point of demand for our Consumer Packaging board grades, we see our Consumer Packaging mill system in balance with our customer demand.", "Results in our Recycling segment reflect the facility reduction and operational improvements that we've made over the past 15 months. We've now closed 12 recycling facilities, as we continue to emphasize profitability and supply to our mills over volume. Segment income was over $7 million higher than last year. Recovered fiber prices were about $25 per ton higher than last year, and $8 per ton higher than the June quarter. Segment volumes were approximately 200,000 tons lower than last year, and about flat with the June quarter.", "The October postings for domestic OCC were flat with September. Export prices increased by up to $10 per ton, depending on grade. We expect continued price moderation during the December quarter.", "At the end of September, our run rate of achieved synergies and performance improvements was $525 million, $75 million higher than the rate we reported last quarter. We are achieving the full run rate of $550 million during this quarter and we're moving past that to focus on productivity and performance improvements across our entire business, whether or not the opportunities have been created by the acquisition. We don't plan to report on synergies and performance improvements going forward as we have in the recent past. We will report on our progress in improving the performance of our business over and above what you would expect, given market conditions and normal inflationary trends for commodities and labor costs.", "Now, I'm going to turn the call over to Ward, who will take you through input costs, our balance sheet, pension and other financial measures.", "Ward Dickson joined us as Chief Financial Officer in September from Cisco Systems, where he was Senior Vice President of Finance for their sales and customer service channels. Ward has extensive experience in domestic and international markets in both operational finance and corporate finance roles. He previously worked at General Electric, Scientific Atlanta and then, Cisco. I'm very pleased to have him on board. Ward?", "Ward H. Dickson", "Thank you, Steve. I'm pleased to join the RockTenn team. Now turning to input cost. Wood fiber cost increased slightly over $1 per ton, somewhat higher than our expectations entering the quarter. Weather patterns, especially in the southern states, were the primary driver of the increased cost.", "Recycled fiber cost increased about $6 per ton, across our mill system. Average natural gas prices were about $0.50 per MMBtu, lower than the June quarter. [indiscernible] month prices are approximately $3.44 per MMBtu, and a 12-month strip of approximately $3.57 per MMBtu compared to an average price of $3.58 in the September quarter.", "On the wood and fiber input side, we believe that wood prices will increase moderately, consistent with seasonal trends we typically experience in the December quarter. Recovered fiber markets will be seasonally soft and somewhat lower pricing in the December quarter.", "At the end of September, our net debt was over $2.8 billion and we reduced net debt by $176 million during the quarter. Our credit agreement EBITDA was $1.48 billion and our credit agreement debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.95x. We had over $1.7 billion in liquidity available to us for general corporate purposes. Our strong balance sheet and credit profile offer a significant flexibility to support our business strategy.", "Let me highlight some of the key items within the tables on Slide 14. Depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2014 are expected to be $590 million, approximately $38 million higher than fiscal 2013. D&A should be fairly even throughout the year. Non-allocated expenses of approximately $70 million are about $20 million lower than fiscal 2013, in large part due to a reduction in pension-related items allocated at the corporate level, as well as continuing reductions in corporate overhead cost. Interest expense of $90 million to $95 million is based on our current 50-50 fixed-to-floating interest rate mix.", "Our average cost of debt is approximately 3.4%, while our marginal cost of floating rate debt is between 1% and 1.5%. Our effective tax rate for the September quarter was 30.6%, comparable to the effective rate in the prior-year quarter and below the 35% to 37% we estimated for the quarter. This was lower than expected primarily due to the recognition of a benefit related to certain foreign deferred income taxes and a decrease in the valuation allowance associated with state tax credits and NOLs.", "We expect a book tax rate for the first quarter in fiscal 2014 to be between 35% and 37%. At September 30, we have recorded unused U.S. federal, state and Canadian net operating losses and tax credits that can be used to offset a total of $553 million in cash taxes.", "We expect to use most of the remaining $212 million tax benefit of our U.S. federal net operating losses primarily during fiscal 2014. We will use our remaining tax benefit of $233 million in cellulosic biofuel, Alternative Minimum Tax and other federal credits over the next 2 years, depending on our taxable income.", "We estimate our cash taxes at approximately $25 million in fiscal 2014 and a cash tax rate of approximately 10% in fiscal 2015 and 30% in fiscal 2016. After we have utilized all of our federal net operating losses, the cellulosic biofuel credits can be used to offset a maximum of 75% when the federal cash tax is due.", "We continue to expect that our 2014 capital expenditures will be in the range of $525 million to $550 million. We continue to focus on strong working capital management and expect no net change to our working capital dollar investment in fiscal 2014.", "At September 30, our pension plans were underfunded on a GAAP basis by $1 billion. The nearly $500 million reduction from the prior year to our pension liability was due in large part to the increase in discount rates, as well as continuing contributions into our plans.", "Our U.S. pension discount rate at September 30 was 5.19%, a 97-basis-point increase over the prior year. We expect to make total cash contributions of $239 million to our qualified and nonqualified pension plans in fiscal 2014, of which $224 million will be in excess of our estimated pension expense.", "Our modeling would indicate future cash contributions into our qualified pension plans in fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2017 of between $200 million and $255 million annually. Contributions will decline to approximately $130 million in fiscal 2018, after which, based on actuarial assumptions, we will be fully funded. Pension expense should also decline each year from fiscal 2014's level of $15 million.", "We estimate that the expenses related to deferred outage cost for the containerboard and bleach paperboard mills will be about $100 million for fiscal 2014, as outlined in the table on Page 14.", "Now I will turn it back over to Steve, who will address our capital allocation strategy and outlook.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Thanks, Ward. Now that our leverage ratio is below 2x, I want to review our priorities for the use of our free cash flow. As we've said for some time, our first priority is to invest in our business for competitive advantage and to lower our cost.", "In late October, we increased our annual dividend rate by $0.20 per share to $1.40 per share, an increase of 17%. We've set our dividend in the range of the median dividend yield of the S&P mid-cap 400 index and we intend to maintain a competitive dividend range.", "We're going to be operating our business with a targeted leverage ratio of 2x debt-to-EBITDA. We will operate above or below the 2x ratio depending on timing and current opportunities. We're going to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that make us a better business, as we have developed a core competency in successfully executing and integrating acquisitions to create shareholder value.", "Share buybacks will help provide the balance between the other uses in our 2x leverage ratio target. The RockTenn board has increased our available authorized share repurchases from 1.8 million shares to 5 million shares, providing us additional flexibility to buy back shares. I believe these capital allocation priorities provide a strong basis from which to continue to create shareholder value, while maintaining an investment-grade credit profile.", "Now going to turn to the outlook for the December quarter. Overall, we expect seasonal volume trends to affect our businesses in the December quarter, which is typically the softest volume quarter for our businesses. We do have a month's worth of data to look at. So in October, our box volumes increased on an absolute basis compared to September. In October, there's 23 shipping days; in September, there's 20 days. So on an equivalent shipping day basis, our October volumes declined by approximately 2.8%. The decline is due to softness in primary demand for boxes, as well as our box plant consolidation activity and our focus on profitability over volume.", "During the December quarter, we expect to see a normal seasonal increase in the portion of our containerboard shipments to lower value products and markets, including export markets.", "We expect a reduction in the sequential price per ton in our corrugated business by as much as $10 per ton. Given the actions we've taken to match our supply with our customer demand in our containerboard system, the momentum that we've had in capturing increases in productivity will be offset over the near-term by relatively higher cost due to lower production levels.", "Similar to corrugated boxes, folding carton volumes increased on an absolute basis compared to September and declined 2.5% on a per shipping day basis in October compared to September of this year.", "We've seen recent increases in promotional activity in our display business. We just followed up a record September in merchandising displays with another record month in October.", "For our commodity input cost in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter, we expect seasonal declines in recovered fiber cost to be more than offset by seasonal increases in wood fiber and energy cost. As compared to the prior year December quarter, we expect increases in recovered fiber, wood fiber and energy cost.", "For all of fiscal '14, we expect to continue to deliver attractive free cash flow returns to our shareholders. Given recent operating trends and the guidance that we've provided for other balance sheet and cash flow items, we expect free cash flow for fiscal '14 to be in the range of $12.50 to $13.50 per share. This is an increase of 12% to 21% over fiscal '13, provides an attractive return relative to our current stock price.", "This concludes our prepared remarks. Ward, Jim, Mike and I are now available to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from George Staphos, Merrill Lynch.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I'll ask a couple of questions, then go back in the queue. Steve, I guess, first question for you. Obviously, here we are, in November, there's a long way to go in terms of the upcoming fiscal year. But when we look at the free cash flow per share guidance, I think it's down a little bit from the range you had provided last quarter. What were the key factors, if I'm correct in that premise, in terms of the reduction in the forecast? The follow-on question I had, specific to Florence. I know you've been investing in the wood yard and the chip delivery system. Are you doing any other investment? I remember, it being about a $40 million figure for Florence. Are you doing any other investment at that mill?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "The wood yard is the primary investment, which is in the $40 million. We spend capital at each of our mills, but that's the big item. I think with the free cash flow guidance, I think it's just an update of our perception of market conditions, input cost and everything else that we look at. If I had to pick one factor, it would be probably the market conditions that were -- that we faced so far this year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Phil Gresh, JPMorgan.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "First question is just a bit of a follow-up there. I think you said sequentially, you're expecting a $10 per ton decrease in pricing. And I wanted to confirm, if that was more on the export front or on the domestic front? And if you could just kind of follow up with -- you've talked about the downtime you're taking, kind of above and beyond Seminole at this point. Could you kind of quantify what we're seeing there in terms of trends so far this quarter, in terms of the downtime?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Okay. Just with respect to the downtime in October, we took 15,000 tons in this other category, and we're not in a position to comment on how we're operating our mill system currently, but that's the answer to that question. I think on a sequential basis, the $10 -- if I had to pick one factor, it would be the export market. However, we do sell white top, as an example. We'll sell relatively less of that in the December quarter than other periods during the year. So that serves to -- as that mix. That's the reason I said products as well as markets.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub, Buckingham Research Group.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Steve, during Jim's tenure, you talked about tremendous growth, et cetera, and M&A had certainly been part of RockTenn's DNA. Do you expect -- and, obviously, you were part of that as well as the CFO. Do you expect that to continue to be a driving force to value creation at RockTenn?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I think we have capability to do acquisitions to add significant value. We're somewhat -- we need to look at the opportunities as they come up, and we've had, for as long as I've been here, a pretty straightforward test of -- if we're going to make an acquisition, does it make us a better business? And so I think we're going to be very disciplined looking at acquisitions. And as opportunities come up, if they make us a better business, then we're going to evaluate them and we're going to see if we can consummate a transaction.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chip Dillon of Vertical Research Partners.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Question is, I noticed that the pension liability went down quite a bit from the end of '12 to the end of '13, which obviously, I believe was a function of maybe, your performance in your investments, coupled with the higher interest rates. And I was just curious, it seemed like the pension contribution guidance you gave us looking out, I know the next few years are kind of set in stone because of government calculations. But is there room for that $130 million you're talking about beyond fiscal '17 to be lower? And is the amount in fiscal '16 to '17, for example, set in stone at this point?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Unfortunately, with respect to pension, nothing is set in stone. So it's just a function of a host of actuarial assumptions. But the drivers you've mentioned, Chip, are the discount rate and then the investment returns. I think we are in a position to where we're not accruing a significant service cost. And so we're really looking at effectively cashing out or -- of the unfunded liability. So the unfunded liability, the change in that on our funding obligations going forward are just a function of the series of assumptions that I think you and I have already discussed.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Scott Gaffner, Barclays.", "Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just wanted to look at the capital returns here for a minute. Two things: one, on the share repurchase authorization you moved from the 1.8 million shares up to 5 million. Can you talk about how you make that decision to go forward with repurchases, is there timing around this 5 million shares? And then also, when you talk about value accreting acquisition opportunities, predominantly North America-based today, how much do you look at international acquisition opportunities?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Okay. I think with respect to the share buybacks, we have that queued up after what we need to do to invest in our business. We are investing more capital this year than last year. Our expected capital expenditures of $525 million to $550 million are higher than the $440 million, we still generate significant cash flow. We will look at acquisitions and I think we want to maintain the 2x leverage ratio, so that we can execute on an acquisition as they come up. The share buybacks end up almost being a residual, but we'll make a judgment as we're looking at our cash flow generation. And in the moment, we will execute those from time to time as we think appropriate. I think with respect to acquisition opportunities, we are North American-focused. We do export about 1 million tons overseas. And I think about 2/3 of that is to Central and South America. And so, just if there were an opportunity, I think we would be looking more positively toward opportunities in that area, as compared to either Europe or Asia. But again, anything that we would do, we're going to ask ourselves: are we better off as a result of having made that acquisition? Meaning, it would have to have some fit with our existing businesses.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chris Manuel, Wells Fargo.", "Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "First, I just wanted to get a sense of -- just a clarification question relative with the $10 differential and export pricing. Just to be clear, you're not seeing any reduction in export prices, is that correct? Or is it just a function of mix within your business that you'll more have this quarter?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Jim?", "James B. Porter", "This is Jim Porter. So we're seeing somewhat of a combination. Principally, it is mix as we look at the products we make brown linerboard, corrugating medium and white top linerboard as our principal mix. And as we look at this go-forward quarter, we're seeing no change in the North American domestic markets. However, we are seeing somewhat of a mix shift for less volume in our total sales portfolio of white liner compared to brown liner. And that's -- when we do the math on that, that's where this $10 reduction comes from.", "Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "That's helpful. And Steve, as you've now had a little bit time in your new roles, any changes that you envision or ways that you may approach the business a little differently than in the past?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Well, today's the 5th. I think I started on the 1st, so I'm on Day 5. And I've worked here for a long time. I think Jim and I had what I would characterize as a very good, open, candid relationship. So I haven't been sitting around for a long time saying, \"Gee, just wait until I get the chance. And we're going to do a lot of changes.\" So I don't think there's -- there's not a big change agenda. We're going to keep on doing what we've been doing and I expect us to continue to be successful.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Philip Ng with Jefferies.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Your box shipments were tracking in line to a little stronger than the industry for most of the year. It seems like it's weakened a bit relative to the industry. Did you lose some market share during the quarter? Or is it more a function of your exposure to the export market? And then separately, you're taking about 100,000 tons of maintenance downtime during fiscal 1Q. Can you give us a little more color on some of the [indiscernible] economic downtimes you're taking?", "James B. Porter", "This is Jim Porter. Philip, so you ask, really, 2 questions. One is our inventory levels. And I think we shared on last quarter's call that we were going to increase our inventories between 25,000 and 50,000 tons, largely focused on trying to operate our supply chain to our box plant system and our external customers in a better place at levels lower -- the lower levels where we had been operating, we were finding more expediting and tension in the supply chain that we felt would be relieved and better serving our customers with a slightly higher level. So we did build inventories by approximately 35,000 tons. And at this point, we're really where we think we should be. You should see some normal vacillation about our current inventory numbers, building slightly when we go into heavy maintenance downtime periods and falling slightly when we come out of those periods. But I think you can see that where we are now, we're pleased with. Now when you look at the -- I believe your second question, which was relative to maintenance downtime. We've tried to do a better job of matching the planning cycle for our large mill outages to take our downtime in a more pro rata way across the quarter spread, principally to reduce the impact on our supply chain, both internal and external box plant customers. If we can even the amount of downtime we're taking quarter-to-quarter, it creates less change, and therefore, less impact on our customers. We're also moving some volume into the first quarter for us, which is a seasonally softer quarter. So you see a better match of overall supply and demand. So I hope that answers your question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Al Kabili, Macquarie.", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "And just, Steve, I wanted to follow up on -- you mentioned the competitive or the industry dynamics, I should say, are a little bit worse than you had originally anticipated, say, a quarter ago. And if we look at U.S. box shipments, they were kind of -- they're still kind of tracking flat, maybe modestly up in the quarter. So there doesn't seem to be too much deterioration as far as where volumes are tracking versus the prior quarter. So I just wanted to -- if you could just follow up on where you're seeing some of the downside versus your original assessment? If it's export market, if it's domestic and [indiscernible] any color you can provide there?", "James B. Porter", "This is Jim Porter again. So as we reflect on our view over the past couple of quarters, looking forward, I think, frankly, we were looking at the economic forecast of those that spend their careers doing that. And I think the overall GDP in nondurable goods forecast a number of months ago were a bit more bullish than what we're feeling now. I think all of the political and global economic impact has somewhat softened consumer confidence, is how I would interpret it. And we're seeing the purchase of nondurable food, beverage products by our large consumer products companies, slowing. I think you all read the outputs of the Kellogg's, the P&Gs and the others, and those are our customers. And so we're seeing just some softening, if you will, in the purchase of those products, which translates into our packaging. So it's generally just a softening of what I think was an overly bullish global domestic economic forecast.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "[indiscernible] Al, it might be a little bit early to at least project what's going on with respect to consumer products companies. I think we need to wait to see total box numbers come out in October. I think with respect to our business, our operating rates were very strong in July and August. And you just saw operating rates go down by, I think, close to 500 basis points in 1 month. And I think if you're going to look at one factor affecting the near-term environment, it would be that.", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Okay, that's helpful. Just a follow-up on that point, do you see -- in an addition with the slowing, do you see incrementally a more competitive dynamic in the industry with some of the capacity additions and creep that we're seeing, just to follow up on the dynamic that both you and Jim are referring to?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I think that's hard for us to comment on. I won't say -- we're focused more on the long-term, on sustaining a good business. And so, unfortunately, volume, you can measure like every day. And you look at it and say, you feel good or bad about volume. But volume is relatively down the list for what we focus on because we're trying to focus on improving our cost structure. If you go to one of our box plants, you have big banners of safety, quality, productivity and cost, and we're investing in the box plants. So we're very much focused on trying to do that and finding customers that fit with that philosophy. And we've been doing that very successfully for a year. Box volumes were up over 2% on a year-over-year basis. And we're going to continue to do that. And then the volumes are somewhat going to be the residual output of our execution of all of that -- or all of those strategies.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from George Staphos, Merrill Lynch.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Actually, my next question was a segue, I guess, on Al's question. To the extent that you can comment, had you seen up till today any change in pricing dynamic in recycled versus virgin in North America? Realizing, Jim, that overall domestic has been stable. Has there been any differential between recycled and virgin? And then my other question was, aside from just normal seasonality, you have more generation, et cetera, and that's why OCC prices maybe are flat to down in the fourth calendar quarter. Is there any other issue that you're seeing in terms of what's keeping OCC relatively stable or lower at the present time?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Yes, I think we haven't seen a differential, at least in North America, with respect to recycle and virgin prices. With respect to recovered fiber prices, we are in our annual period of the year where generation tends to outstrip demand. And so we would expect moderation in prices. And I think when we get out next year, it's going to be a function of a variety of things, which you would expect demand to go up somewhat, and we'll see how supply catches up with it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Phil Gresh, JPMorgan.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "My follow-up question is just regarding acquisition opportunities. If you can discuss how you think about the relative attractiveness of containerboard versus boxboard at this stage? What your pipeline looks like right now? And if an M&A opportunity were to come along, how high would you be willing to go with your leverage before thinking about issuing equity?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "There's a number of questions there. I think, I can't really differentiate without knowing the specific opportunity, whether containerboard would be rather than -- better than a boxboard. We have made 3 smaller acquisitions from Smurfit and they were on the converting side of containerboard. We've got a very talented management team in both Consumer Packaging and containerboard on corrugated business. I think we're capable of doing acquisitions. I just can't prioritize one over the other. I think the -- how high will it go on leverage before we issued equity is very situation-specific. I think our credit agreement covenant is 3.5x. So if we got to a point to where we're at call it, 2.75x to 3x, I think we'd be looking at probably needing to refinance our balance sheet. I think it would -- it really depends on the opportunity, but I think it would be -- that would be about at our comfort level to where we'd have to scratch our heads and say, \"Are we going to issue equity beyond that point?\" But again, it's pretty hard to say something absolute without looking at the specific situation.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got it. And Steve, how does the pipeline look right now? Would you say, M&A is a priority for you in the next 6 to 9 months?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I think we always look at acquisitions. So I think, there is a flow out there. I can't say it's either higher or lower than in my experience. I think there are transactions out there and we look at a lot of them. And back to, if we're a better business, then we try to execute on them. But I'd say deal -- there is deal flow and I can't say whether it's not a lot higher than it's been and it's not a lot lower than it's been.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chip Dillon, Vertical Research Partners.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Just one quick one. You mentioned you're going to break out the merchandise displays business and I think the last numbers we had were for fiscal '10. And it looks like since then, the business has about doubled with a margin staying 9% to 10%. Was there any reason that doubled other than just organic growth? I don't recall if you inherited something from the Smurfit-Stone acquisition? If you could break that growth down for us that would be great.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Okay. Sure. It is the Smurfit-Stone acquisition. But we moved, I think, 3 manufacturing plants over to display, 1 in Adams, Wisconsin, 1 in Chicago and 1 in Ohio [ph]. I'm glad you asked because out of all the things that went on in the integration, the integration of the display business worked as well as any aspect of the integration that we had at RockTenn.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Anthony Pettinari, Citi.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I had a follow-up question on OCC costs. I was wondering if you could give any color on what you're seeing around Solvay. And when you think about that OCC basket in the Northeast, would you expect fiber cost to be elevated moving forward, given you've had a competitor that's brought on a large mill? Or do you think you'll get a little bit of relief there? I'm wondering if you could just comment on that [indiscernible].", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Yes. We thought with the new mill going there that there'd be some upward pressure on prices. It hasn't been as much as we would've thought because prices in other areas of the country have been low enough to where people can absorb the freight cost and deliver to sell them.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up, on Hopewell, I think you have a modernization project scheduled there for April of next year. Can you remind us what the potential net capacity out of that project could be? And then understanding that capacity coming on as sort of dependent on market conditions, when you would make the decision whether or not to utilize that extra capacity?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Yes, just the volume number is 120,000 tons. And I think we said on the last call, we'll just look at what market conditions are. The project had some value, even if we operate at the lower rate, because it reduces the overall cost structure of the mill.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Alex Ovshey, Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Steve and Ward, on your fiscal 2014 free cash flow per share guidance, can you comment on whether you're including any benefits from share buyback? And what you guys are factoring in for pulp prices?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Just that we haven't factored in a number in that guidance for share buyback. I think with respect to pulp prices, it's not a huge impact on us, so I just can't answer that question.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, Steve. And then you took 60,000 tons of downtime in the fiscal fourth quarter. Would you be able to give us some sense of how to think about the cost of the downtime on your system?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "It's a tough one because we go up and down on capacity, give me just a minute. Yes, I think if you had to have a range of a number, it would be $200 to $300 per ton. But I'd just caution you that it's very difficult to estimate exactly what the cost is.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful, Steve. And maybe just one last question for me on the volume outlook for corrugated. You gave the sequential change in your box shipments in October versus September on a per day basis. Would you be able to give us the year-over-year change for your box shipments in October, relative to last year's October? And then, you talked about some incremental promotional activity happening in the displays business and that [ph] doing well. As you talk to your customer base, I mean, is there any sense that we may see a pickup in box shipments over the next 12 months? Or are we sort of in for more of the same where it's kind of the flattish to slightly positive trend for the industry?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I think as far as outlook for shipments, it's -- I don't think we have any better crystal ball than anybody else. We pretty much make boxes based on orders that we get from our customers. And I think going out, there's a series of macroeconomic factors that just affect things. But again, your crystal ball is probably going to be as good or better than mine. I think with respect to the October box shipments, I think we're down around 5% year-over-year, the number of shipping days in October comparable year-over-year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steve Chercover, D.A. Davidson.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "This is just a simple question. Forgive me if I should know this. But the Seminole mill, is that a recycled fiber facility? Or is it -- does it also have virgin lines?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "It's 100% recycled.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Great. I guess that's why it's a swing mill.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "That's exactly why it's a swing mill.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Connelly, CLSA.", "Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "Steve, 2 things: is it safe to assume that the box plant rationalization process is pretty well over? And second, with all that you've learned in the containerboard and corrugated rationalization and optimization that you've done, is there something similar that you might be able to do with your consumer business beyond everybody just focusing on price to get those margins up?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Just I think with respect to the box plant rationalization, I think it is pretty well over. I think the business that we operate in, there's swings in demand and supply and we'll react to those over time. But just generally, if there's something we need to do, we will do it as rapidly as we can. I think just with respect to the box plant system, we are turning very much focused on improving the quality of each one of our operations. And that includes some investment in the converting side of the box plants that I mentioned on the call. I think with respect to consumer, I'm not sure I can -- Mike, do you want to comment on that?", "Michael E. Kiepura", "Sure. I'm happy to. I would say that prior to the Smurfit-Stone acquisition and the consolidation, on the container -- corrugated container side, we had gone through that folding carton side. Since the Gulf States acquisition 8 years ago now, we have closed 7 or 8 plants and run 20 folding carton plants. So we have largely done that. And then on our Recycling business, a little over 2 years since the Smurfit-Stone acquisition, we've closed 12 recycling plants. So we have applied that same consolidation strategy of fewer, bigger, more cost-effective plants across our businesses.", "Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "Okay. So we'll focus mostly on price.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Adam Josephson, KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Steve, why the decision to temporarily shut a machine at Seminole as opposed to a more drastic step such as permanently closing the mill? I understand it was 1 particularly bad month, but what conditions would cause you to close the mill as opposed to just temporarily taking down a machine?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I think it's hard for us to comment on future decisions. I think just the temporary plan was pretty straightforward decision, given the trends that we see in customer demand relative to our productive capacity. I just don't want to speculate on hypotheticals.", "Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Sure. Understood. And one other one on buybacks. At what pace do you plan to repurchase shares over the next couple of years? I know Jim said on the last call that he considered your shares attractive and the stock was higher then than it is today.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I think we're going to look at it on almost where we are at the time. I think we're trying to balance what we can do inside the business, with respect to acquisition opportunities. And we've only turned the -- this is our first quarter at 2. So I think we'll just see how time progresses, how actively we have -- we execute on the buybacks. The buybacks are a good alternative for us because where investing in yourselves is a good alternative. I think if we can invest and make ourselves even better, that ends up being a better alternative. And we haven't run out of runway to improve yet.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Scott Gaffner, Barclays.", "Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just one quick follow-up on that. If you had 1.8 million shares authorized, that was about 2.5% of the shares outstanding. So you've almost doubled that. So I think that would suggest that maybe something is more imminent. I mean, is there something we should read into this? Or is there any other reason why you would take the authorization up from 1.8 million to 5 million?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Yes. I think you look at the authorization in the context for the outlook for fiscal year '14, we expect to generate very strong cash flow. We're at 2x. And you can do your own model for what you project that will be at end of the year. And if -- pending other opportunities coming up, then our leverage would go down and the prospect of us buying back 1.8 million or more shares, given that scenario, would say, well, maybe you'd want to do that. So I think our outlook for the business and the cash flow generation would make 5 million an appropriate authorization to consider. Whether we do that or not, I'd just reiterate what I said before, depends on facts and circumstances.", "Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Understood. Just an operational question. You took your inventories up a little bit this year in order to save some transportation cost. Can you talk about what sort of savings you might realize on transportation cost? And then the second question is sort of a follow-on with that, is that -- with the box plant operating system being in place and being put into more facilities, are you able to respond quicker than you have historically to changes in demand conditions in order to balance supply-demand and maybe gather information and move that up the supply chain?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Yes. I think the answer is yes. We do have better information. We have invested in our box system and inventories. And I think we come from a construct of we're in the business to serve our customers. And on-time delivery is probably the most important thing to do. And so if the concept of us increasing inventories is to have more roll stock at the box plants so we can respond to their orders, is just -- all of it lines up. And at least with interest rates, as low as they are -- it's a relatively inexpensive form of investment to increase customer satisfaction. I think with respect to the transportation cost, I don't have that -- I just don't have that number at my fingertips.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chris Manuel, Wells Fargo.", "Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just one quick follow-up. With respect to -- I think you gave some commentary earlier with respect to a few of the price increases for CRB and SBS, that there may take as long as July I think to get implemented if I heard you correctly. Can you maybe talk a little bit about dynamics there? Is it -- why maybe that [indiscernible].", "Michael E. Kiepura", "Well, the dynamics on the consumer side with the CRB and the SBS price increase is that the majority of our business is under contract with a consumer packaged goods company, particularly large consumer goods company. And those contracts vary all across the board. Typically, they're multiyear contracts with 6-month or 1-year openers to adjust for things such as changes in the board market. And I think unlike the corrugated business, the folding carton business doesn't have nearly as much of the short-term transactional, local business. It tends to be bigger segments, under contract for longer period of time. So it typically takes us 6 to 9 months to fully implement a change in board pricing to carry that and transition that through to the converting side.", "Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And then I guess, I did have one further follow-up, too. When you think -- I recognize October, demand off quite a bit, do you have any sense, I mean maybe this kind of has to bear out over the next few months to really see but any sense as to an impact of government shutdowns or things of that nature may have had that affect -- make this, say, a 1-month blip as opposed to more of an anomaly, as opposed to a fact pattern?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Yes. I don't think there's enough information out there to determine whether it's a fact pattern or not. The difference in shipping days, if we recharacterize the numbers as total volume within respect to September and October, we could say our volumes were up 10%. In fact, more than 10%. And so I think, just the -- I think you can be careful as to reading too much into a blip of data. We're just 1 participant in the market. So I think you have to combine that with a host of other data in order to come to a conclusion.", "Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Does your gut tell you that dialogue you've had with your different consumer products companies that there was an impact from potential government shutdowns?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "We're far -- we're relatively distant from, I think, that dynamic. So I kind of think it's hard to -- I think it's really hard for us to comment on that. Or in fact, hard for our customers to comment on it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Al Kabili, Macquarie.", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Just a quick follow-up for me. It's just on a cost inflation from labor, non-material cost inflation. Any sense for how we should be thinking about how that tracks up year-over-year in '14? And is there enough -- do you see enough from some of the productivity initiatives you outlined earlier in the call to offset that or is there a drag that we should be thinking about?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "The labor, it's -- I think we look at that as being $60 million, $70 million per year, would be the increase. And that would be salary increases and healthcare increases combined. There are some other cost increases, which are in there, which would be -- the biggest factors would be commodities. I think we've said what we can on the outlook for commodities. I'm glad you asked about the productivity improvements. I think we're -- I think we said we're going to stop reporting on synergies and performance improvements or what we've done in the past. I think we're anticipating that we would show performance improvements across our system in the range of $100 million to $150 million in fiscal '14 over fiscal '13. And that would outstrip the labor, whether it outstrips all of our commodity costs increases or not, I'll revert back to it depends on what the commodity costs are. But we still have significant runway to improve the performance of our existing assets.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from Alex Ovshey, Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I just had one quick follow-up, and I may have missed this. On the share buyback, have you bought back any stock thus for -- thus far in the quarter? And are there any restrictions in terms of being able to buy back stock here for the balance of the quarter?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "No, we haven't bought back stock, so far, this quarter. I think with the restrictions going forward, I don't think there are restrictions.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no other questions.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Okay, great.

My name is Kathy. I will be your operator for today's conference. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Rock-Tenn First Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, slides are being presented today as part of the conference call. These slides can be accessed at www.rocktenn.com under the investors page. Ladies and gentlemen, this call is being recorded today January 29, 2014. (Operator instructions)", "Your speakers for today's call are Mr. Steve Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Ward Dickson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ", "Mr. Voorhees, you may begin the conference.", "Steve Voorhees", "Thanks, Kathy. Welcome to everyone who's listening to our call. I'm Steve Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer. I'm joined in the office this morning by Ward Dickson, Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Porter, President of our Corrugated Packaging business.", "For those of you following the weather, we're having a memorable couple of days in Atlanta. I believe Mike Kiepura is calling in - President of our Consumer Packaging and Recycling businesses, is calling in from home. Are you there, Mike?", "Michael Kiepura", "I am, Steve.", "Steve Voorhees", "Okay, excellent. Okay. So, we'll start with our forward-looking statement. ", "During the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates, and beliefs related to future events.", "These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discuss. These risks and uncertainties are described in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent 10-K. We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call and have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation.", "I'm going to start with a discussion of our operating results, and then Ward will discuss our input cost, balance sheet, pension, and other financial matter \u2013 measures. I will complete our prepared remarks with comments on our outlook, and then Ward, Jim, Mike, and I will be available for your questions.", "The success of our team in executing our strategy drove our 23% increase in earnings per share. We generated over $250 million in free cash flow, and we used that cash to pay down debt, contribute to our pension plans, pay our dividend, make an acquisition, and buy back stock.", "And we did all of this while reducing our leverage ratio from 1.95 to 1.84x. We have a lot of energy around a well-balanced set of actions to satisfy our customers, reduce our cost, invest in our businesses, and deploy our cash flow, where we can have the greatest impact for our shareholders.", "Net sales increased by 3% over the prior-year quarter. Higher pricing more than offset reduced volume.", "Over the last 12 months, credit agreement EBITDA has increased by 27% to $1.5 billion. This is over $300 million higher than one year ago.", "Our free cash flow per share in the December quarter was positively impacted by higher pricing, and also by our taking the opportunity to accelerate the collection of a portion of our accounts receivable portfolio on very attractive terms. Ward is going to discuss this accounts receivable facility in more detail in his commentary.", "These favorable items were somewhat offset by lower corrugated volumes and the associated cost of producing at lower levels. The net result of these and other factors was that our free cash flow of $3.46 per share was 26% higher than one year ago. Free cash flow of $11.87 per share over the past 12 months is 49% higher than last year.", "Our leverage ratio of 1.84x is nearly a full turn below where it was just one year ago. We have the ability to provide our shareholders with strong current cash flow returns, and have significant flexibility to improve these returns by deploying this free cash flow to implement our strategy and/or returning this capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.", "The Corrugated Packaging and Display businesses showed significant improvement as compared to last year. Our Consumer Packaging business improved upon its already solid results. Taxes and other items generated a $0.10 per share improvement, primarily due to lower interest expense, with the remainder due to a lower effective tax rate.", "Turning to our Corrugated Packaging business. Industry box volumes as reported by the Fiber Box Association on a per-day basis were flat on average in October and November. The December numbers won't be published until February 3.", "Industry containerboard mill operating rates averaged 92% for the quarter, as compared to 96% one year ago and 97% in the September quarter. Industry shipments of containerboard to export markets declined by 2% from the prior-year quarter.", "RockTenn's export shipments of 214,000 tons increased by 5% over the prior-year quarter. Our 273,000 tons of domestic sales of containerboard to third parties were 55,000 tons less than the prior-year quarter. Our average day box volumes of 304 million square feet declined by 3% compared to the prior-year quarter and 0.5% sequentially.", "We saw declines in demand for food, beverages, and household product categories. Most other sectors were stable.", "Our volumes were also affected by the closure of five more plants over the past year, raising the total over the past 2.5 years to 20. Finally, we have continued our commercial focus on profitability and customer value.", "While we have had some disruption to box shipments due to weather and other related items in July \u2013 in January, given a stable overall market environment, we expect our box volumes for the entire fiscal year to be approximately flat compared to last year. Our combined shipments of containerboard and corrugated boxes were 1.81 million tons during the quarter, down 3.6%. This compares to last year's shipments of 1.88 million tons.", "We reacted quickly to this reduction in demand, and drove a corresponding reduction in production during the quarter. Our operating rates averaged 89%, with aggregate downtime of approximately 250,000 tons.", "This compares to a 98% operating rate and 31,000 tons of downtime in the prior-year quarter. 93,000 tons of the 250,000 tons of downtime was for maintenance downtime, including annual major maintenance outages at our Fernandina Beach, Florence, and Hodge mills, each of which was completed on or ahead of our expectations. Fernandina Beach came up three days early, reflecting positively on our planning, engineering, and execution capabilities.", "The remaining 157,000 tons of downtime resulted from a combination of actions, including flowbacks across our mill system and the temporary idling of the paper machine at our Seminole mill. These actions allowed us to adjust to our customers' softer demand in the quarter, while giving us flexibility to ramp back up to meet the strengthening in demand that we saw in the second half of December.", "Turning to the current quarter, in January we have had interruptions to containerboard mill production due to weather and the related factors of approximately 25,000 tons. On January 21, we brought back up the idled machine at Seminole.", "Based on our expectations of corrugated segment shipments in the March quarter at a level comparable to last year, we expect to run full for the balance of the quarter. This will allow us to accommodate 84,000 tons of major maintenance outages, primarily at West Point and Panama City, and build a modest amount of inventory to support our business for the second half of the fiscal year.", "Corrugated segment sales of $1.65 billion were up 3.9% over last year's December quarter, with higher prices more than offsetting reduced volumes. EBITDA margins increased from 15.4% to 16.3%.", "Corrugated Packaging segment EBITDA for the December quarter was $269 million, 10% higher than last year. Prices increased by $119 million, or $65 per ton over last year.", "Sequentially, containerboard prices increased by $9 per ton, reflecting better markets and mix than we had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. Commodities and freight cost increased by $43 million.", "Recycled fiber composite averages increased approximately $17 per ton over last year. Virgin fiber cost increased by about $1 per ton. Together, fiber cost increases account for $36 million of the $43 million increase in commodities and freight cost.", "Natural gas costs increased by $0.20 per MMBtu. Electricity cost increased by 1.2%. This resulted in higher energy costs of $3 million.", "Freight cost were unfavorable by approximately $3 million. Amortization of deferred outage cost increased by $6 million.", "The cost of the 250,000 tons of downtime, excluding the increase in amortization of deferred outage cost, was $22 million. This includes cash maintenance cost expensed in the quarter and the labor and other semi-fixed cost of economic downtime, including slowbacks.", "Turning to the productivity of our box plant system. Our average volumes per box plant during December were 2.8% higher than last year.", "We achieved a record low level of box plant [inaudible] in December. Corrugated productivity tied the division high during the quarter.", "Diecutter productivity achieved an all-time high in the month of December. All of these result from the hard work of our team across the RockTenn box plant system.", "This past weekend we began operating one of our new Flexall folded willers in our box plant in Richmond, Virginia. We'll start up another one in Humboldt, Tennessee in March. These are the first two of a total of six we will install during FY \u201814.", "Last week we started up a new die cutter in our box plant in Liberty, Missouri. This $7 million investment has a very attractive return based on improved quality and higher productivity.", "In our containerboard mill system we have several key capital projects underway, including the second phase of our Hopewell capital project scheduled as part of the month-long outage beginning in early April. The wood yard modernization project at Florence is underway, and scheduled for completion this summer.", "Last week we completed the sale of our only wholly-owned box plant in China for approximately $5 million. This was essentially book value. We continue to own an interest in a joint venturer box plant in China that is very successfully operated by our partner.", "Because the primary audience for our conference call is investors, I don't expect to regularly report on our safety results. However, safety is of utmost importance to our Company, and we invest a lot of time on safety initiatives designed to increase employee engagement and improve our safety performance.", "In the December quarter, we reported our best ever safety results for our Corrugated business. All considered, I'm very pleased with our Corrugated Packaging results this quarter, as our team demonstrated their ability to operate very successfully in a very fluid environment.", "Now to our Consumer Packaging segment. SBS industry backlogs as of January 15 were 504,000 tons. This was up approximately 36% from one year ago. RockTenn's SBS backlogs now stand at 3.5 weeks, in line with our expectations at this time of year.", "CRB industry backlogs as of January 15 were 120,000 tons, down by about 19,000 tons from one year ago. RockTenn's CRB backlogs now stand at four weeks. This is above our expectations for this time of year.", "The SBS and CRB price indices published in PPW have been flat since September of 2013. At this point it was implemented, the vast majority of the board price increases we have anticipated.", "The stable market environment contributed to strong financial performance in the quarter. Sales increased by 4%.", "EBITDA margins remain stable in the 17% range. Total Consumer Packaging segment shipments of 378,000 tons increased by 2.6% over last year. This includes the 1% increase in our shipments of converted products.", "Even though November and December historically represent the low months of demand for our consumer packaging board grades, there was no falloff in orders, and we took no economic downtime in the SBS and CRB grades in the quarter.", "Our Consumer Packaging business segment EBITDA of $80 million in the December quarter increased by $3 million over the prior-year quarter. Higher prices and volumes more than offset cost increases.", "Assuming that the market environment continues to be stable, we expect our results in Consumer Packaging for the remainder of the year to be in line with our prior-year results. Consistent with our long-held strategy of investing for competitive advantage, we are investing $11 million in the new printer and die cutter for our Nicholasville, Kentucky folding carton plant.", "This investment will generate an attractive return by increasing productivity, reducing waste, reducing maintenance and repair spending, and adding additional contribution margin.

If I heard you correctly I think you said \u2013 you thought box shipments would be flat for the segment for the full year. You were down 3% in the first quarter. I think you said flat in 2Q. If you are getting the flat in the full-year, are you looking for some sort of increase in the second half of the year around box shipments? And if so, why?", "Steve Voorhees ", "You heard that correctly. We do expect flat shipments. I think just continued execution of our strategy.

But there's no \u2013 I mean are you expecting \u2013 because you mentioned earlier you saw declines in the first quarter in food and beverage and household categories.

I think demand for boxes is \u2013 we look at it is very stable. It's a very significant product in our economy and we think the implementation of our \u2013 of what we're doing will result in the flat shipments for the entire fiscal year.", "Scott Gaffner \u2013 Barclays ", "Okay.

", "Two questions. The first one on pricing, Steve and Jim. Back to the question on mix, if I heard you correctly and correct me if I'm wrong, you said that your export shipments were actually up in the quarter. I think you said something to the effect of 5%. I think box \u2013 and let's call it domestic containerboard was broadly down you know 3%. ", "[Almost equal] [ph] I would expect that to be more negative for mix than positive. I realize you were describing the mix versus your expectations. But could you be a little bit more specific in terms of how that work together to give you a, I guess an almost $20-per-ton improvement in your mix versus your prior expectations?", "Steve Voorhees ", "Yes. I understand your questions. I think you don't have our prior expectation so it's hard to make the judgment.", "George Staphos \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch", "Sure.", "Steve Voorhees ", "The judgment. I think our overall shipments in corrugated and the corrugated segment were down 3.6%. Our box shipments were down less than that. In fact, there were down around 3% is actually little bit less than that. And so, the higher proportion of the domestic third-party and the export and the \u2013 resulted in the change of mix.", "George Staphos \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "Steve Voorhees ", "I'm sorry. I can't get more specific. But that's what it is. ", "George Staphos \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch", "I appreciate the additional clarity anyway. I guess the next question I'll ask is again on corrugated. Can you remind us on where you stand with the implementation of Kiwi[ph]? And how good you feel about how confident you feel in terms of the visibility you have into your numbers, your P&L, all of those things that you'd like to control and have line of sight to in your corrugated segment \u2013 in corrugated business of the box plant network?

The installation is going very well and I continue to be optimistic about the improved consistency and ability to have stability across the system and the capability to better forecast demand, our supply, on-time deliveries, in general, enhancing the overall efficiency of serving our customers. ", "But it \u2013 again as just one of many and we're seeing the traction in all of the areas of our business and a much higher level of engagement of our coworkers, and I think we're just seeing a much higher degree of execution within our business across many, many areas.", "George Staphos \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. ", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Good morning and congratulations. ", "Steve Voorhees ", "Good morning.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "A couple of questions. The first one is I wonder \u2013 either Steve or Jim \u2013 can you just talk about the amount of sort of incremental creep that you've generated across the system over the last 30 months? ", "Steve Voorhees ", "We're \u2013 because I can't even think in time, Mark.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Yes. I'm sorry. I was just \u2013 I was struck last year when I was down at Chesapeake that you know as of last \u2013 you could actually put about 8% incremental volume through that mill since you'd acquired it from Smurfit, and that hasn't been a mill that you've been talking about. You've been talking about the capital programs and a lot of other ones. So, I just \u2013 I wonder in total what this adds up to?", "Jim Porter ", "So, Mark, I would answer like this. We're very focused at improving the efficiencies in all of our mills and that means improving our uptime from a maintenance perspective, improving the execution of our scheduled outages and incrementally improving machine speeds and overall efficiency. So, it is really a daily quest at each one of our mills. ", "However, we're also keenly focused on matching our supply with our customers demand. And so, the concept of creep is yes there as long as there's creep in demand. If there's not creep in demand, you won't see us exceeding our productive capacity. So, that's really how I would look at the question. ", "Steve Voorhees ", "Yes. Okay, Mark. So, here's some numbers. In 2011 in the 10-K, we reported total containerboard capacity of 7.992 million tons and then the K we just filed at 7.85 million tons. ", "The difference \u2013 the math is Matane we took out, which was 176,000 tons. And the residual which you know would be \u2013 I don't have the number but you can calculate might be 40,000 tons would be the creep. ", "Now, we have a project at Hopewell, which is going to add on the order of 120,000 tons that will be operational this summer. I think we've been very consistent that while we will have the capacity, there's also cost savings that we operate at the same level. So, we continue to be looking at this kind of to match for our production to meet our customer demand. Hopefully, that's helpful. ", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Yes. I would have thought Steve, actually, just given what I've kind of actually heard that some of these other mill sites that incremental creep would have been greater then. ", "The other question I have is just in terms of kind of growth going forward, you've got the balance sheet back in good shape, you're operating well, and you know we came into the company, Steve, the stock was in the low to mid teens. You've created a lot of shareholder value by execution and by acquisitions. And I'd like to just get your thoughts on where you might acquire going forward. I think particularly in the containerboard business, you know we're all curious about how much more could you grow domestically and do you need to start to expand internationally if you want to grow?", "Steve Voorhees ", "I guess \u2013 you're on the issues as we're looking at them. Our balance sheet is in terrific shape. I think we can grow across any of our businesses. I think you run into [Inaudible] potentially domestically at some point. And we do export, as Jim said, around the world and I think there is the potential \u2013 yes, there would be that would expand internationally. ", "We're in that fortunate position of I think where we have an impetus to act to create shareholder value but we don't have a need to act rationally but we've bought back stocks this past quarter, we talked about buying back our stock as it means to \u2013 and make sure we have appropriate leverage on our business, which we said is about two times. But we're continuing to look at I think all of the opportunities and just judge them on their merits. ", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, that's helpful. Good luck in the coming quarter, Steve. ", "Steve Voorhees ", "Thanks, Mark.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs ", "Thank you. Good morning, guys. ", "Steve Voorhees ", "Hello. ", "Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs ", "Good morning, Steve. So, couple of questions for you. So, if we're talking flat demand for the year and seminar coming up, is the implication there that you're not assuming any further lack of order downtime for the balance of the year as you see it today? ", "", "Steve Voorhees ", "I think what we said was for the rest of this quarter, we have visibility into \u2013 we expect around full. I think beyond that time, they're assuming variables to coming on the outlook beyond, you know, primarily demand variables for boxes but also the export markets. We don't have visibility into business and beyond right now the month of March with respect to our plans to operate. ", "Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs ", "Got it, Steve, understood. Very fair and very helpful. And then the second thing if we just took their $22 million of sort of downtime costs and divided up with a number of tonnage that's you know on economic lack of order downtime. You know you need \u2013 you get to a number per ton. Is that you think a fair proxy to think about you know your lack of order downtime costs per ton on go-forward basis this time if you have to take it? ", "Steve Voorhees ", "There are so many variables. I think it's hard to say that would be a fair proxy. It is what we believe it was in December, based on the downtime that we took. ", "Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs ", "Yes. I think the reason that's so important is that's some pretty reasonable number. I mean I sort of think about what people tend to talk about in the industry. It's sort of north of $200 a ton and that number is well below that. So, I think that's interesting that's why I asked the question. So, okay. I \u2013 but it seems like in the quarter certainly was obviously reflective of what it was for you. ", "Steve Voorhees ", "Right. And just \u2013 I'll repeat. I was very pleased with the [inaudible] our entire business had to adjust to that. ", "Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs ", "Perfect. I'll turn it over. Thanks very much. ", "", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Philip Ng with Jefferies. Your line is open. ", "Philip Ng \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "Good morning, guys. Switching gears, I just had a question in your consumer business. If I heard you correctly, you're expecting EBIT to be flat for the rest of the year. With pricing flowing through them, I'm kind of surprised EBIT from the flat in demand seems to pick up a little bit here. ", "Steve Voorhees ", "Yes. Mike, can you take that one? ", "Michael Kiepura ", "Sure. My \u2013 I think it's a combination of \u2013 there is price recovery but that's also offsetting amount [ph] of the input costs on both energy and on the fiber side. So, in balance it would appear to be you know flat relative to last year. ", "Philip Ng \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "Okay. And Mike, you've \u2013 and then the commentary about pricing you guys fully have it flowing through. Is that $8 million Delta [ph] benefited from a bridge standpoint in the quarter good run rate going forward the rest of the year? Or is that a good way to think about it? It gives \u2013 it's different nuances in terms of timing and odds and stuff? ", "", "Michael Kiepura ", "There are certainly the nuances with the timing. But we would expect to get the benefit of the pricing that we have you know for the most part implemented at this part \u2013 at this point to continue to flow through at the balance of the year. ", "Philip Ng \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "Okay, okay. That's helpful. And then, just quickly on the containerboard segment, you're obviously expecting demand to pick up a little bit in the back half of the year. Is that mostly a function of your view of the broader market? Or just from a competitive landscape standpoint that when things aren't getting \u2013 things aren't as choppy as it was late in the year? ", "Steve Voorhees ", "I'll start and then Jim could add-on. There's a seasonal inquiry that you would expect in the June and September quarters. And then we're also positive on what we're doing in the box business. ", "Jim Porter ", "Yes, Steve. I think that really covers it. I think we have the seasonal improvement that is usually there in the second half of the year as we see demand for products escalating somewhat. Our execution were clear. It's improving. And we I guess have some optimism that the economy is on a slightly improving trend. ", "Philip Ng \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "Okay. And lastly, you know just gives you \u2013 on the free cash flow side you guys bumped it up and you brought back a good amount of stock during the quarter. How should we be thinking about the cadence of buybacks over the course of the year? Pretty balanced or is that going to be a little more backend loaded? ", "", "Steve Voorhees ", "Yes. The \u2013 it's \u2013 we're going to use the stock buybacks to manage our leverage ratio and we continue to look at opportunities across the business. And so, we don't have a specific outlook. It's really going to be balance sheet and opportunity driven. So I can'1t tell you whether it will be even or whether it'll be lumpy. I can't totally see at the end of the year how it turns out. But frankly, we've described our attitude toward that and we're going to take that attitude and it'll play out how it plays out. ", "Philip Ng \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "Okay. Thanks, guys. Good luck on the quarter. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Sir, your line is open. ", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Thank you. I like \u2013 I got disconnected for a few seconds. I hope this question wasn't already answered. But on the free cash flow guidance, you raised it by about $0.50 and at the same time you talked about the working capital shift, $50 million to $75 million. So basically, did the working capital go up by about $0.80? And then all of the other items was about a negative $0.30? Is that the right way to look at it? ", "Steve Voorhees", "That's right. Yes.

Given where you guys operated in the quarter, our looks at demand for the underlying consumer what's getting pulled out is showing some \u2013 is seemingly some modest acceleration, things getting better. ", "So, I guess my question at this point do you feel that you know you've have kind of got your own inventories and the customer inventories are closer to where there should be? And kind of to your point that you're anticipating some box growth the balance of the year. How would you maybe help us to think about that? ", "Steve Voorhees ", "Just \u2013 look, our inventories are aware we want them to be. We actually reduced inventory by \u2013 was it 12,000 tons?

With respect to our customers inventories, I just have to tell you I don't know how they stand. I don't have a very good feel for that. ", "Jim, do you have...", "Jim Porter ", "I'd have to say that they're somewhat in the middle range and maybe on the skinnier side that the middle, but beyond that I don't think we can really forecast them. I mean we often look at the industry data on the history of inventories and there have been some trending to lower average levels over time. But right now, I think the overall stock flow looks are pretty healthy across the \u2013 our industry. ", "Chris Manuel \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Okay, that's helpful. And then you know one last kind of follow up being \u2013 as you're thinking about looking at M&A opportunities today and balanced with what you're seeing with some of your return oriented projects, you know I think some of your return oriented projects that have been giving you high teens low 20s returns. Is there anything that is different with the \u2013 you know I think you talked about maintenance capital in the past being 350-ish. This other kind of $200 million you're spending that's \u2013 is there anything different with that today? Or how you would be evaluating M&A opportunities? ", "Steve Voorhees ", "I don't think that there is a material difference. I will say, as we invest in our plans and I highlighted investments in the folding carbon plant and die cutter and [inaudible] Missouri then we have our flexes going in both in Richmond. I think as we do that, and as we are successful, I think we have the opportunity to come even more successful is that what happens in the plants is when they look at a piece of equipment, there's \u2013 I think we get another increment of performance from higher engagement from all of the employees and that makes it easier to do the next one. And as we get more experienced, I think we can develop a good pattern there.

And does that restart have any \u2013 is there any issue in the marketplace that would affect that decision in terms of the success or lack thereof of some of the conversions especially the one in the South from newsprint to recycled containerboard? ", "Jim Porter ", "Okay. Well, that question I think has a couple of dimensions. One, our Seminole mills, we're just very proud of the progress that they've made and that team does one heck of a job of producing a very high-quality product. The cost structure has improved dramatically. And yet, they have been on the short end of the stick so to speak and have had to swing with us as we've matched much our supply with demand. But they do one heck of a job. And we will continue to look at that facility as to how we can help them drive costs out. But we will use that machine set to ensure that we're balancing supply with demand. ", "Now, as we shifted the second phase of your question as to the conversion, we're all aware of the capacity additions within the impact machine and the Atlantic packaging and newsprint machine. And I think they're trying to be successful at producing containerboard. I see some evidence of that. But we really don't run into a lot of head-to-head with them. ", "So, I can't comment on those success. I know they're working hard but they've got challenges, both in terms of capital and meeting the market quality expectations that our customers have. ", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Your line is open.", "Adam Josephson \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. ", "Steve Voorhees ", "Good morning, Adam.", "Jim Porter ", "Good morning, Adam.", "Adam Josephson \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Jim, how would you characterize export markets at the moment? And how do you compare them to three or six months ago? ", "", "Jim Porter ", "I think as we commented earlier, I see them firming really in all sectors of the world. China has been \u2013 China and Asia have frankly been very stable over the last six months or so, continue to be firm. The rest of the world had a bit of a softening over the last quarter. But have firmed and we're seeing strong demand in all regions. And along with that, there's some corresponding firming prices. ", "Adam Josephson \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Got it. Thanks for that. And Steve, I think you talked about lower food and beverage and household product demand in your corrugated business but no such declines in your CRB and SBS businesses. And I'm just trying to understand that seeming disconnect. ", "Steve Voorhees ", "Mike, do have a comment on the food and beverage and consumer...", "Michael Kiepura ", "I'd say on the consumer side typically food and beverage are really more food because we're really not a significant player on the beverage side. So of mix, 70 plus percent is on the food. And as you would expect that's pretty stable. And so, you know the industry trade association for the quarter over volumes were flat. We were up a couple of percent. So, we just think it's stable. I think it's a little more episodic with who your particular customers happen to be and for the quarter. And over a longer period of time, our base has been a little bit stronger than the overall market. ", "Adam Josephson \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Thanks a lot for that. I appreciate it. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.", "Steve Chercover \u2013 DA Davidson & Co.", "Thanks. Good morning. ", "Yes. I too was interested in the commentary on food and beverage, given my own behavior over the holidays. Are you seeing any offsetting I guess consumption? Is it substantial enough to \u2013 could you quantify was it coming online retail? ", "Steve Voorhees ", "You're talking about with respect to boxes for...", "Steve Chercover \u2013 DA Davidson & Co.", "Yes. I guess they call it the \"Amazon affect\". I mean is it tangible? ", "Steve Voorhees ", "You know we've tried to do that and really haven't come up with a \u2013 anything that I would describe is putting meaningful. I think we do see in the display business and made a comment about the impact of changes in the retail shopper trends. They are changing. ", "I think our customers are working to figure out how to market their products between online and in-store and just the way we experience it short-term as primary demand for displays is very strong. ", "I had somebody telling me about going to a store that if you have a headache, you can't order the cure online and expect to have an affect so you've got to go to the store that causes business of marketing that product or other markets like that having a promotional display can help by business. ", "Steve Chercover \u2013 DA Davidson & Co.", "I see. Yes. We're kind of late in the cycles. I lot of the questions have been asked. But for two of the three new mills or conversions that you referenced are basically in the you know Syracuse region, so to speak. So, are you saying that you really haven't felt much impact, either on your fiber costs or your customer base? ", "Jim Porter ", "I can't say the \u2013 this is Jim Porter. I can't we haven't felt any impact because we certainly have. But ourselves a New York mill produces an extraordinary product that is in very high demand by our box plants and independent customers within that region. It has not affected at all the demand for the product. And so, we remain just fine in that regard. ", "Fiber, as you all those countries some softening and demand all over North America, as we've seen some of the decline from Asia. So the ripple effect of fiber is such that it's somewhat normalized. But you know, clearly, we see signs of those facilities acquiring fiber and talking to \u2013 with customers. But our assets continue to be disciplined. ", "Steve Chercover \u2013 DA Davidson & Co.", "Terrific. Best wishes for '14. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Connelly. Your line is open. ", "Mark Connelly \u2013 CLSA Limited", "I've just got one. Respect to downtime, you know the industry mantra is slow back is better than shutting machines down. You obviously have more of a hybrid approach with the Seminole. Should we assume that that's still a dynamic process? And with \u2013 you know because remember the slow back thing came up in the 1990s. The industry is so different now. I wonder whether you still look at this dynamically and say, \u201cDo we shut the machine down? Or do a slow back across the system? Or is the difference just so overwhelming that we're just going to stay this way? ", "Steve Voorhees ", "Your comment on dynamic is spot on. I think every situation is different and I think we work hard to take a fresh look at every problem. Let's not assume the answer is the same as it was before. And so we went into this past situation recognizing we have to be very flexible and that was the answer of the \u2013 emerged. So, dynamic is per say, perhaps, description. ", "Mark Connelly \u2013 CLSA Limited", "Super. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator instructions) Mark Weintraub with Buckingham research. Your line is open.", "", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckinham Research Group", "Thank you. I just wanted to follow up a little bit on your comment that market conditions are feeling better and certainly you highlighted that in the export market. Was that also true in a domestic market? Because at the same time you're talking about how January has been difficult and I don't know if that was more about a our cost issue or whether or not because of the weather that was also affecting the demand side. If you could just clarify on that that'll be helpful. ", "Jim Porter ", "I think we're seeing \u2013 this is Jim Porter. Again, I think we're seeing firming domestic demand as well. As we indicated, we brought back up our Seminole machines on January 21st and we now have all of our assets running at capacity and that is needed in order for us to match our supply with demand. ", "Yes, we did comment that we've had a tough winter so far in January and we've taken some hits and a number of our facilities. And today, we're fortunately \u2013 all operating, except I understand that Annapolis [ph] snowing down this morning. They'd do some challenges. So, we continue to feel the brunt of this weather pressure and it has had at hit. ", "But back to your comment on demand, I think we see it as full and we'll match it with our system. ", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckinham Research Group", "Great. And just one other \u2013 you also mentioned that you would build a little inventory. I assume that that is a seasonal thing for maintenance that you'd be taking later in the year. Is that how to think about that? Or...", "Steve Voorhees ", "Well, as we indicated, we lowered inventory this past quarter by about 12,000 tons and we're now going into a shutdown season in which we have three of our mills plants to take approximately 83,000 tons of downtime in this quarter. The Panama City Florence and West Point Mills will be going down. And so we need to build a little bit of inventory to ensure we take care of our customers during the period. ", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckinham Research Group", "Okay. So this inventory \u2013 that's a small \u2013 we're talking small numbers in terms of inventory shift in behavior? ", "Steve Voorhees ", "We micromanage the inventories daily in order to be sure that we're taking care of our customers and matching our production capacity with demand. ", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckinham Research Group", "Terrific. Thanks very much. ", "Operator", "Thank you. And at this time, I'm showing no further questions. ", "Michael Kiepura ", "Okay. Thank you very much for taking the time to listen to our call and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Thanks. ", "Operator", "", "And this concludes today's conference.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the RockTenn Second Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]", "As a reminder, slides are being presented today as part of the conference call. These slides can be accessed at www.rocktenn.com under the Investors page.", "Ladies and gentlemen, this call is being recorded today, April 29, 2014. [Operator Instructions]", "Your speakers for today's call are Mr. Steve Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Ward Dickson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Voorhees, you may begin your conference.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Thanks, Shirley. Welcome to those of you who are listening in. This is Steve Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer. I'm joined this morning by Ward Dickson, Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Porter, President of our Paper Solutions Business. Mike Kiepura, President of our Packaging Solutions Business, was diagnosed with appendicitis over the weekend and consequently is not able to be with us today.", "During the course of the call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discussed. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent 10-K and also our 10-Q filed for the quarter ending December 31, 2013. We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We've provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the Appendix of the slide presentation. The slide presentation is available on our website.", "I'm going to start by discussing our operating results, then Ward will discuss our balance sheet, pension and other financial measures. I'll complete our prepared remarks with comments on our outlook, and then Ward, Jim and I will be available for your questions.", "We made progress across many areas of our business in the March quarter. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 13% over the prior year in the face of severe weather and associated impact on our operations during the quarter. Compared to our expectations coming into the quarter, the severe weather reduced income by $44 million on a pretax basis, or $0.38 per share after tax, due to a combination of lost production, unplanned overtime, increased energy cost, increased fiber cost and increased freight cost.", "We're achieving productivity improvements in our mills, corrugated box and folding carton plant operations. We continued to invest in our converting and mill operations to improve quality, reliability and productivity.", "Our Merchandising Displays business grew both sales and income by over 30% compared to the prior year quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter of 42.7% was higher than our expected range of 35% to 37%.", "On March 31, the New York state legislature passed a new law that reduced the corporate income tax rate to 0 for certain qualifying manufacturers, including RockTenn. While this is positive for us long term, this change also caused us to write off a previously negotiated Empire Zone tax credit associated with the Solvay mill that was previously recorded as a deferred state tax asset. The impact of this item during the quarter was a $10 million charge or $0.13 per share. And consistent with our past practice, we've not added this back to our calculation of adjusted net income of $1.27 per share.", "We generated very strong free cash flow of over $170 million in the March quarter. This is an increase of 40% on a per-share basis over last year. For the first 6 months of our fiscal year, we generated over $420 million in free cash flow. On March 3, we announced an agreement to acquire the Tacoma mill from Simpson for approximately $343 million. The complementary West Coast mill location is quite strategic for our Corrugated Packaging and Containerboard business and will create significant operating efficiencies for our system. We will be able to greatly improve the service to our corrugated box plants on the West Coast and our external customers on both the West and East Coasts. We are awaiting regulatory approval to complete this acquisition.", "Over the past 12 months, Credit Agreement EBITDA has increased by 27% to over $1.5 billion. This is $331 million higher than 1 year ago. Our Credit Agreement EBITDA margin increased by 300 basis points to 16.5%. Our free cash flow of $12.53 per share over the past 12 months is 56% higher than last year. Our leverage ratio of 1.75x is also nearly a full turn below where it was 1 year ago.", "We're providing our shareholders with strong, current cash flow returns. We have significant flexibility to improve these returns by deploying this cash flow to implement our operating strategy and also by returning this capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.", "Corrugated Packaging contributed an additional $0.21 per share of income compared to the prior year quarter as increased pricing more than offset the impact of increased cost and reduced volumes. Reductions in our interest and nonallocated costs contributed an additional $0.09 of income. And the variance in income taxes, including the New York state adjustment, reduced income by $0.17 per share.", "Turning to our Corrugated Packaging business. Industry containerboard mill operating rates averaged 95.2% for the quarter, flat with last year and higher than the March figure of 94.6%. Our containerboard mill's operating rate of 94% in the March quarter compares to 90% in the December quarter. Our containerboard mill's system downtime in the quarter was 87,000 tons. Of this, 73,000 tons was a result of scheduled maintenance outages at West Point and Panama City. The Seminole mill remained idle during the first 3 weeks of January until customer demand picked up. Seminole accounted for the majority of the remaining 14,000 tons of downtime during the quarter.", "Industry production of containerboard for export markets increased by more than 3% from the prior year and increased 10% on a sequential quarter basis. RockTenn's export shipments of 267,000 tons increased by 50,000 tons over the prior year -- prior year and sequential quarters. Percentages shipped to end markets remained consistent on a sequential basis at approximately 60% to Latin America, 20% to the Middle East and 10% each to Europe and Asia. Our 256,000 tons of domestic sales of containerboard were 63,000 tons less than the prior year quarter.", "In the second quarter, we built approximately 36,000 tons of containerboard inventories in anticipation of the expected 85,000 tons of maintenance downtime in the June quarter. We expect inventories will decline by 50,000 tons in the June quarter.", "We expect to complete our scheduled outage at Hopewell next week. The outage has included the installation of a sheet press, new paper machine drives and a new dryer section, which will significantly improve quality for our customers. This upgrade will also provide the opportunity to either increase our linerboard production by approximately 124,000 tons per year or produce a lesser amount of linerboard with reduced energy cost.", "Our Hopewell mill investments have positioned this mill to produce a significantly better quality virgin containerboard product for both our internal and external customers at lower cost. The mill's location in the mid-Atlantic region is a great fit for our system.", "At West Point, we successfully replaced a headbox, which helped us to greatly improve the moisture and basis weight profile of our sheet and overall quality for our customers. This investment also improves efficiency in cost from this paper machine. Also at West Point, in late March, we identified that black liquor had entered a condensate line. We addressed the situation over the next 9 days. The impact of this unscheduled downtime was a loss of 23,000 tons of production, which when combined with incremental cost, will reduce pretax income by approximately $10 million in the June quarter.", "Our Florence wood yard project remains on schedule for an August startup. The $49 million project will result in an annual benefit in excess of $10 million in fiscal year 2015 and grow over the following couple of years.", "Turning to the Corrugated Box business. Industry box volumes on a per-day basis, as reported by the Fiber Box Association, declined 1.6% in the March quarter and 3.3% in the month of March alone, both as compared to the prior year.", "In our box plant system, we're seeing the results of our investments and strong focus on operational improvements. Over the past 3 years, we've closed 21 plants to enable cost reduction and productivity improvements at our remaining box plants. Our waste is currently 4.6% less than fiscal '13 and 19% less than the levels we experienced in fiscal year '11.", "On-time delivery, corrugator, flexo folder gluer and die cutter productivity have all increased this year compared to fiscal year 2013, and each are significantly better than we ran in fiscal year '11. For example, our rotary die cutter productivity is now 14% better than fiscal year '11.", "As we complete the installation of our box plant technology platform in our U.S. plants in the June quarter, we will be positioned to implement and sustain additional operating improvements across our entire box plant system.", "During the March quarter, we successfully installed new EVOL flexo folder gluers in our Richmond, Virginia, and Humboldt, Tennessee, box plants, and a new DRO rotary die cutter in our Liberty, Missouri, box plant. Each of the 3 plants is operating more efficiently as a result of the new equipment. We will install an additional 4 EVOLs during this fiscal year.", "In fiscal 2015, we will continue with the modernization of our box plant system by installing EVOLs at the rate of about 1 per month.", "", "In the March quarter, our volumes of 18.2 billion square feet were 4.5% less on a per-day basis than 1 year ago. Average box pricing increased by $63 per ton compared to the prior year quarter. So far in April, we're seeing an increase in shipments in the range of 1% to 2% greater than March as we've experienced seasonal improvement in demand. The net result of the quarter was an increase in Corrugated Packaging segment sales of $1.65 billion, up 2.7% over last year's March quarter with overall prices increasing by $50 per ton and more than offsetting reduced volumes from our closed box plants.", "Corrugated Packaging segment EBITDA for the March quarter was $243 million, 13% higher than last year. EBITDA margins increased from 13.9% to 15.2%. The impact of the severe weather on Corrugated Packaging segment results was $35 million as compared to our expectations going into the quarter.", "Let's turn to our Consumer Packaging segment. SBS industry backlogs as of April 16 were 588,000 tons, approximately 93,000 tons more than 1 year ago. Industry SBS backlogs are at the highest level since January 2013. This is except for a very short period last summer. SBS markets are in good balance and April's publication again posted another increase of $15 per ton, accumulative total of $40 toward the full $50 realization. RockTenn's SBS backlogs now stand at 6 weeks.", "CRB industry backlogs as of April 16 were 119,000 tons, about 45,000 tons less than 1 year ago. RockTenn's CRB backlogs now stand at 3 weeks.", "Our CRB, SBS and URB mills ran at 94% during the quarter with no economic downtime taken at any of our 5 CRB mills or our Demopolis SBS mill.", "We took annual major maintenance -- we took our annual major maintenance outage at Demopolis during the month of March last year and took this year's mini outage in the month of April. The expected cost of the April Demopolis outage is approximately $0.05 per share.", "In our Consumer Packaging segment, total sales were up 4.5%, and segment EBITDA was flat with the prior year. We expect our results in Consumer Packaging for the full fiscal year to be in line to slightly above our prior year results. Demand for April remained stable for SBS and folding carton, while our CRB backlogs have softened slightly. We do not expect to take any economic downtime in the CRB segment.", "Our new printer and die cutter for our Nicholasville, Kentucky, folding carton plant will begin operation in June. This is an $11 million investment. We'll make comparable investments to our Knoxville, Tennessee, and Clinton, Iowa, folding carton plants over the course of the next year.", "These investments will generate attractive returns by increasing productivity; reducing waste; reducing maintenance and repair spending; and in the case of Knoxville and Clinton, provide the capability to meet customer growth requirements.", "Merchandising Displays achieved record sales of $213 million in the quarter as compared to $162 million last year. The MPG acquisitions contributed $20 million, of this $51 million in incremental revenue and was accretive to earnings in the quarter. We're on track to capture the synergies we expected from the acquisition, including the internalization of materials previously purchased from third parties, and more importantly, the benefit of our increased overall capability to serve customers.", "Segment EBITDA margins were approximately 10%. The promotional environment remains very healthy with consumer products companies finding more ways to differentiate their products in the store, including multi-vendor promotional displays and major redesigns of existing display programs. The additional costs associated with bringing new business into our system reduced margins in the quarter. We expect this to continue into the June quarter when we expect sales to increase. We expect income to remain relatively flat or possibly down slightly compared to last year.", "Pictured on the slide is RockTenn's McCormick Simply Asia display, which won the Creative Best of Show Award for best temporary display among all contest category entries at this year's annual competition sponsored by the Point-Of-Purchase Advertising International or POPAI. This is a tangible example of the capability of our very talented designers across our entire company.", "Recycling segment volumes were about 240,000 tons less than the prior year due primarily to our previous closures of 10 underperforming recycling plants since February of 2013. It's also due to the generally soft recycled fiber markets, including exports to China. Segment income was lower than our expectations, primarily due to the impact of severe weather and material processing and freight cost.", "During the quarter, we realized the benefit of price increases in our business of $102 million. Average selling prices in Corrugated Packaging were $50 a ton higher than last year. Average selling prices in Consumer Packaging were $35 per ton higher than the prior year with gains in SBS and CRB increasing by $64 per ton and $24 per ton, respectively. The net impact of volume changes was a positive $2 million. The inflational -- inflationary impact of commodities, freight and energy was $55 million higher than the previous year. The impact of the severe winter weather was $44 million as compared to our expectations at the outset of the quarter. This was the coldest winter in the last 20 years in many parts of the country. The average heating days index, as compared to last year and as published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, was about 14% higher on average in the key areas of the country in which we operate.", "NYMEX natural gas prices spiked in February by $1.15 per MMBtu to $5.56 per MMBtu and averaged $1.34 per MMBtu higher for the quarter than in the December quarter.", "There were many locations where local natural gas prices were significantly higher or gas was unavailable and our facilities had to switch to more expensive fuel oil. The extreme cold and snow levels also impacted production in our facilities and our ability to get product to our customers. We lost 57 days of production in our box plants during the quarter.", "The Morgan Stanley dry-van index, which measures incremental demand for dry-van truckload services compared to incremental supply, hit historic highs during the middle of March, reflecting the extreme scarcity of trucks.", "The $44 million of increased costs due to severe weather include $18 million of higher energy cost, lost volume of $18 million, higher wood and recycled fiber cost of $9 million, and increased labor, freight and maintenance costs of $7 million.", "The unusual operating environment over the past 2 quarters has masked the productivity improvements that we've made and expect to continue to make across our businesses.", "Our productivity improvements include pure cost reduction projects in areas such as procurement and logistics, capital projects that reduce cost and Lean Six Sigma projects. The majority of Lean Six Sigma projects improved operating efficiency, reliability and quality at our manufacturing locations.", "In aggregate, these productivity improvements have reduced our cost at an annual rate of approximately $120 million when compared to the prior year quarter.", "I will turn it over to Ward now, who will discuss various financial aspects of our business. Ward?", "Ward H. Dickson", "Thank you, Steve. During the quarter, we generated free cash flow of $171 million. And as expected, we sold the second tranche of accounts receivable into our accounts receivable sale program and received $66 million of incremental proceeds. We now have a net $131 million of total receivable advances under this program. I am not expecting any more significant advances under this program for the balance of calendar year 2014 due to the limitations in other financing agreements.", "Over the last 12 months, we have generated free cash flow of $12.53 per share and reduced net debt by $493 million. After repurchasing 560,000 shares in the December quarter, we did not repurchase shares in the March quarter. Our pro forma leverage, after the acquisition of the Tacoma mill, will be closer to 2x.", "At the end of March, our net debt was approximately $2.6 billion, our LTM Credit Agreement EBITDA was over $1.5 billion and our credit agreement debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.75x. We have more than $1.7 billion in liquidity available to us for general corporate purposes.", "Let me highlight some key assumptions for the third quarter and the remainder of the fiscal year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter of 42.7% was much higher than our normal range of 35% to 37%. On March 31, the New York state legislature passed a law reducing the income tax rate to 0% for certain qualifying manufacturers, which RockTenn is. This change required us to fully reserve against previously recorded net deferred tax assets. Although we will no longer expect to use these state tax credits, the applicable statutory tax rate for our New York operations will become zero. The impact of this item during the quarter was a $10 million charge, or $0.13 per share, and we have not added this back to our calculation of adjusted net income of $1.27 per share. Our effective tax rate, without the aforementioned New York state tax item, was 36.1%.", "At March 31, we have recorded unused U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating losses and tax credits that can be used to offset a total of $410 million in cash taxes. We expect to use the remaining U.S. federal net operating losses during fiscal 2014. We will use our remaining U.S. federal tax benefit of $234 million in cellulosic biofuel, alternative minimum tax and other federal credits during fiscal year 2015 and 2016. Based on current assumptions, we estimate our cash taxes at approximately $25 million to $30 million in fiscal 2014 and a cash tax rate of approximately mid-teens percent in fiscal 2015 and mid-20s percent in fiscal 2016.", "The June quarter is our largest pension contribution quarter. We will make cash contributions to our pension plans of $107 million this quarter or approximately $103 million more than expense. We expect our 2014 capital expenditures will be closer to $550 million. We estimate that the expenses related to outage costs for the containerboard and bleached -- paperboard mills will be about $103 million for fiscal 2014. We are planning on taking 91,000 tons of scheduled maintenance downtime during the June quarter.", "We expect that working capital and other balance sheet items will be a use of funds of approximately $25 million to $30 million in the June quarter, with no significant additional change in the September quarter.", "Now I will turn it back over to Steve, who will discuss the recent realignment of our business and the outlook.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Thanks, Ward. Two weeks ago, we realigned our organizational structure by creating 2 well-coordinated business units to serve our customers better and simplify the way we do business.", "Paper Solutions is led by Jim Porter. This includes our containerboard and paperboard mill operations as well as the sales of containerboard, paperboard and pulp to independent converters in export markets. Paper Solutions also includes our recycled fiber business.", "Mike Kiepura leads our Packaging Solutions business, which encompasses our corrugated box, folding cartons, partitions and merchandising displays businesses. This realignment simplifies our organization by bringing our mill operating expertise together, and separately, bringing our packaging design and operations expertise together. We're better structured to provide our customers with our complete offering of corrugated boxes, folding cartons, partitions and promotional displays.", "In several cases, our customers have requested and we've provided a single point of contact. In other cases, we'll maintain our current sales relationships but be better positioned to enable better communication across our organization for the benefit of our customers.", "Since the announcement was made, we've received very positive feedback from many of our customers. We haven't changed our external reporting segments as our current 4 reportable segments are highly relevant to how we assess and manage our various businesses.", "Turning to the outlook. We're seeing a pickup in volumes in April, and expect that our box volumes will be stronger in the quarter on a per-day basis as compared to the March quarter, although likely less than the prior year quarter. Our domestic containerboard and box business is holding firm. Export markets are improving. We expect we will export more tons in each of our last 2 fiscal quarters.", "Positive results from the improving sales environment will be offset somewhat by higher forecasted recycled fiber, freight and commodity costs and the effect of the unplanned downtime in early April at the West Point mill. We expect free cash flow for the June quarter to be in the range of the $2.34 per share we generated in the March quarter. For all of fiscal '14, our revised estimate of free cash flow is in the range of $11.75 to $12.25 per share. The reduction from our prior estimate is due to our actual results in the March quarter, our outlook for the business and our expected use of cash for working capital and capital investment during the balance of the year.", "Conclude our prepared comments by underlying our confidence in our ability to provide our shareholders with strong current cash flow returns and the ability to improve those returns by deploying our free cash flow to further develop our strategy and by returning this capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.", "Ward, Jim and I are now available to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Gaffner with Barclays.", "Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Steve, just had a question on the volume outlook. I think you said you saw some pickup in April. I thought I heard you say a sequential increase of 1% to 2% over March. But it looks like, in your closing remarks, you said volumes will be down in the quarter year-over-year. Can you talk about what's driving that? I thought maybe after we got through some of these weather issues, we'd see a pickup in volume. Is there some underlying demand issues that you're seeing in the marketplace?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Yes, Scott, I'm going to let Jim respond to that.", "James B. Porter", "Good morning, Scott. I think we're all aware of the significant weather that dramatically impacted the current quarter. And we certainly all hope that spring is here and we're moving into a little better period going forward. But when we compare our go-forward look with box volumes relative to prior year, there's several things that we consider. First of all, I believe you're all aware that we've closed 21 of our corrugated plants since the acquisition of Smurfit-Stone, trying to rightsize our portfolio of assets, improving quality, productivity and cost. And when we close plants, we don't capture all of that business in our new operations. We get most, but there is some shrinkage. Secondly, we've had 3 plant closures in the Northeast with our customers in that region. We've seen some contraction due to the highly competitive nature of that region, and that has been a hit. And then I think you're also aware of how we've been looking at our business from a cash flow/margin standpoint. We've taken a very analytical approach at our business. And we've, in some cases, walked away from contract renewals of some of our accounts that we really just were not able to serve profitably. So when you put all that together, we're very focused on margin and cash flow and satisfying our customers, more important than volume focus. And when you look at the cash flow generated from this approach, we believe that we've more than offset any volume hit by improved margins.", "Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And my second question was more around capital allocation. You mentioned you didn't buy back any shares in the quarter. I know you're working through the Simpson Tacoma acquisition, but I think you said even after the closure -- once you've acquired that business, you're still going to be a 2x net debt to EBITDA. I would think, with where the shares are today, it would be an opportune time to maybe go after some more of the share repurchase. Can you talk us through that, or are we going to have to wait until the acquisition closes, et cetera?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I'm going to amplify just -- Scott, I'm going to answer that question, before I get to that, I think just to quantify the volume impact in April, we're up 1.2%. If you compare it to the prior year month, we're running a little bit over 1% down versus the prior year. I just do that because I think our volumes year-over-year were down 4.5% year-over-year, and we're nowhere close to that. So it's slightly down versus the prior year. With respect to stock repurchases, I'm glad you mentioned the Simpson acquisition. We announced that on March 3. So we effectively were unable to buy back stock until we got to that point. And then our quiet period begins March 16, so we had a very short period of time. And I think the $343 million will bring us up to 2x. So I just look at -- are not buying back shares just being a quarter. And I think we'll continue to have the same view towards capital allocation, and we'll be using stock buybacks to get us to around 2x on a leverage basis.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Want to drill down a little bit more into the free cash flow outlook? The midpoint from the last conference call had been $13.50. And now it is $12, so it's about $1.50 change. And clearly, the weather had a very big impact in the first quarter alone. Your order of magnitude, $0.50, which would suggest that there's another $1 per share adjustment. And you referenced some of those drivers. Could you get a little more explicit as to what that dollar composition, how that would've been made up?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I'm not sure I can. I think just when you do look at the weather, we'll kind of reiterate when we look at the numbers, we're not a taxpayer. I think you figured that out implicitly in your question. But that $1 amount just impacts our bottom line. The residual of that is a function of raw materials costs. Gas is significantly higher than we had expected last year. Fiber costs have gone up somewhat, although we expect the virgin fiber cost may trend down a little bit sequentially. And then we've -- Ward identified about $25 million in working capital and other changes, and we've moved our CapEx up to the higher end of the range. So I think all of those factors contribute to the change.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Right. And it seems -- so that $25 million on working capital changes and, say, maybe another $15 million, $20 million on cap spend, so there -- is that about right? So about $40 million, $45 million of it is actually working capital and cap spend?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "That's fair.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay. That's what I was hoping to clarify. And then just lastly, bleached board, you referenced the pricing activity. Does most of this show up quickly? Or does sometimes this beached board pricing take a while to flow through in your system?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "It generally takes longer because the -- considering the contracts tend to be for the multiyear, and then we'll have more or less slow motion in having the contracts, which move with the index, although it just takes somewhat longer.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I guess, first question I had, switching gears a little bit, can you tell us how the Simpson acquisition is progressing? Are there any particular areas that this helps you with from a product standpoint, I want to say maybe white top would be one area, and what are the regulators most interested in? Or when do you think this, ultimately, will close?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "It's kind of hard for us to comment specifically on that. I think we're still in the preliminary phase of the HSR approval. We think this just helps our containerboard position on the West Coast. And there's significant economies on our system from having that product on the West Coast.", "James B. Porter", "Yes, George. Just building -- this is Jim Porter. We're really excited about this opportunity because, as you know, we've got a portfolio of corrugated converting assets out on the West Coast and have had to supply them from very long distances from our East Coast mill. So this acquisition is one that's very strategic for us. It will help us to supply our box plant systems and our box customers with a much more reliable supply chain as well as our other customers in that region. So it's an important acquisition for us.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. My second question, and I think you touched a little bit on this in terms of talking about what you've been doing with your converting network, especially in the Northeast. But there, obviously, have been -- there are reports in the trade press about somewhat more supply pressure and maybe some discounting in the Northeast and the West Coast. I don't know if you can comment specifically to that, but what challenges have arisen, if any, from those fundamentals? And how have you been dealing with it, including, I guess, perhaps, walking away from some business and/or shedding some converting operations?", "James B. Porter", "Well, certainly, the new capacity in North America has impacted us all. The new machines, machine conversion in Toronto, the new mill in Niagara Falls is a substantial increase in volume, particularly for that region of -- the SP Newsprint conversion also is new capacity. So round numbers, 1 million tons of new recycled capacity coming into the market is something that we feel. I won't speak to their specific behaviors as to how they're managing their decisions around customers. But suffice to say that it has impacted us, and we've responded by moving business around. And certainly, we're continuing to satisfy our customers with high-quality products and making decisions as to where we sell based upon the best fit for our supply chain and creating cash flow for our shareholders.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I just -- I had a question on the 2 new business units. If I understand correctly, you're going to have the 2 new business units, but you're also going to keep the 4 segments that you report financials on. And I'm just wondering, is there any possibility for overlap in the sense that, Jim, if I understand correctly, is in charge of all the mills. But he's also going to be in charge of his box plants as President of Corrugated. And Mike is in charge of all the converting facilities, but he's also in charge of the Consumer Packaging mills as the Consumer President. Is that correct? Or how do you think about those relationships?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Thanks for asking the question. I think Jim Porter's responsibility will be squarely on the -- all of our mills, which produce about 9 million tons -- our recycling business. And we have very strong customer relationships in the independent converter market, very significant for us. I think that would be his primary area of responsibility. Mike will be responsible -- is responsible for our packaging businesses, which include the box, the folding carton business, the display business and the partition business. And I'm excited about this because we're going to be able to take all those products and go to the customer based on, boy, the way the customer wants us to go to the customer with our full array of either packaging products or paperboard products. I think, working here, I think we have used the word silos somewhat between businesses, and I think this is going to break down the silos. I think there's -- a couple of related questions which come up, which are: \"Are Jim and Mike going to be able to work together to be able to sort that out?\" And I think that they have worked together. And I think we will look at the business on an integrated basis and review our proxy for next year, you will see that not only mine, but Mike, Jim's, Jeff Chalovich, Craig Gunckel's, and Tom Stigers' income objective will be for all of RockTenn to make sure that we're working together to try to maximize the outcome for the entire company. That's a long-winded answer to your question, but that's the answer.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "That's very, very helpful. And then maybe just switching gears to input costs. I think you referenced recycled fiber cost maybe coming up a bit, and I'm just wondering if you can talk about what you're seeing with those easy [ph] price trends, especially in the Northeast, where you have Solvay and competitors who have brought some capacity on.", "James B. Porter", "Yes, so this is Jim. So forward view on recovered fiber gets pretty tricky. What we've seen is clearly softening in Asia. And I think we've all learned that, that really is the major dynamic for driving recovered fiber prices. North American demand, relatively flat. The big pressure on North American fiber, though, comes from Asia. And as we've seen their economy soften, we've seen demand for recovered fiber soften and hence, price dropping. We would believe that that's going to reverse itself and that the Asian economy would strengthen, increasing demand for recovered fiber, and that would likely have some pressure on price. But as far as trying to forecast that accurately, I wouldn't go out on a limb on that one.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Philip Ng with Jefferies.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Some of the work you guys are doing in Hopewell sounds pretty promising in terms of taking your cost structure down. But if you assume demand is still pretty muted from this point on, you don't run full out, would you still be able to reduce your cost per ton from [ph] that standpoint?", "James B. Porter", "Absolutely -- this is Jim Porter. Absolutely. And that's -- the great thing about this investment is that we're making substantial improvement in these assets, and we're going to be able to deliver significantly better quality virgin containerboard to our customers. It has a great geographic location in the mid-Atlantic, so we're able to serve the full East half of north America with these products. And the investments we're making in press section drives, dryer section, et cetera, will improve our efficiencies, reduce the dryness and energy consumption per unit of paper and will significantly improve the cost structure of this mill, whether we take it in increased production or simply reduced energy because of the dryness improvement.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Got you. That's actually very helpful. And then based on your outlook on demand for containerboard, do you feel like your inventory's in pretty good shape at this point? Obviously, you guys are making some incremental downtime, but just in that demand backdrop, is there any more downtime that you would need to take, potentially, down the road?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "We feel very good about where our inventories are and where our system stands.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So on the competitive or increasing competitiveness in the Northeast, can you talk about if there's specific product lines or where this new capacity is able to better compete with you? I guess, what I'm implicitly asking is the quality, especially of the smaller converted capacity, I mean, how does it stack up with what you guys are offering? And where does it actually compete with you?", "James B. Porter", "So your question is the -- around the quality of the new capacity that's come on?", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes, especially the converted newsprint capacity. Is that effectively competing with you across your entire product offering? Or is there a subset that ultimately that can compete with it?", "James B. Porter", "No, we really wouldn't say that it's targeted at any particular end product packaging segment. It's -- simply, there's new volume, and so some of the corrugated converters in the Northeast are using that product. And so I would say that it's broad based. There are some product categories that require virgin craft because of the strength and moisture-resistant characteristics of that product. And so that would not be a focus of that new capacity. But beyond that, I wouldn't say that it's really focused on anything in particular.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, got it. And then on the April volume, how many days of April do you already have in the book and so far, and -- that volume number is based on?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "It would be based on information we would've had as of yesterday, which would be, I can't tell you whether it's Friday or Saturday. But it would be information that we would've had as of yesterday.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So almost the entire month then. Okay, I got you. And then just last question in terms of the weather-related...", "Steven C. Voorhees", "If you can get back in queue. I think we are trying to keep it to 2 questions per -- I'm happy to ask -- answer the question later, but I would like you to get back in queue.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Al Kabili with Macquarie.", "Daniel Moran - Macquarie Research", "This is Danny Moran on for Al. You guys mentioned some incremental inflationary headwinds on freight and recycled fiber. What are you thinking about for virgin fiber cost in the upcoming quarter? Do you expect a typical seasonal decrease in prices?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I think we'd look at somewhere between -- somewhere around a 1% to 1.5% decrease based on what we're looking at now in June compared to March quarter.", "Daniel Moran - Macquarie Research", "Okay, great. And then last one. Just looking at the segment income bridge on the presentation, you showed $2 million benefit from volumes. With volumes down 2.7% on the corrugated side and a $10 million unfavorable impact from weather, what were the positive drivers here that offset this?", "Ward H. Dickson", "It was primarily the revenue increase in the retail Merchandising Displays business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "A couple of questions for you. First, what are you seeing thus far in pricing demand levels or undermining supply demand fundamentals within the export markets? Are things remaining pretty firm there or softness? Or how would you describe that?", "James B. Porter", "We're seeing demand really strong, and I would say firming beyond that. And with that, we would see increasing prices over time.", "Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, then it's been firm. That's fair. CapEx for '15. It sounds like you've got quite a few of these new box plants and things working through the system. Would it be surprising to see CapEx kind of stay at this level for '15? Or do we go back to kind of more where you've been maybe 2013, 2012?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I think we're putting together our capital plans for next year. I think it's just premature for me to provide guidance on that. I did want to speak about the EVOLs because they're strategic to our container -- to our box plant business. But we'll provide, probably, another measure of guidance on the next call.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.", "James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "This is James Armstrong for Chip Dillon. Most of my questions have been answered. But I have -- of the 36% to 38% tax rate for the year, does that include or exclude the one-time New York tax charge?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "It includes it. In fact, that's why it's up. That's just is the explanation of why it's increased.", "James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Very good. And then if demand stays at April levels, do you see a significant risk that the Seminole mill may need to go back down for any extended period later in this year?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I think that's hard for us to speculate on. I mean, we will match our production to meet the demands of our customers.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc.", "Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Jim, you talked earlier about the impact of your box plant closures on the company's box shipments. At what point would you expect box shipments for the company to turn up on a year-on-year basis? And along those lines, how concerned are you about continuing to see market share?", "James B. Porter", "As I shared earlier, we're really focused on getting our asset portfolio rightsized, and we're getting pretty close to that. And so I can't say there might not be some small moves in the future, but we really like the assets we have at present. And I would say that we should begin to become more industry-average levels as we get towards the end of this year. But again, we look very analytically at our portfolio. We have great customers, and we want to satisfy them with perfect products on time, every time. But we're also focused on margin and cash flow. And so we'll be creating that portfolio of customers that we can supply well and make a margin.", "Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "And just one related question. Do you have a view of what normalized U.S. box demand growth is, should be, and based on what? And obviously, demand has been weaker than expected year-to-date. Obviously, there has been a weather impact. But longer term, what would you expect industry box shipments to be?", "James B. Porter", "That's a great question. I think the way we look at the corrugated marketplace, we see it as a nondurable goods manufacturing minus. And so as we look at trend lines out into the future, that would be the industry that I think we would think most closely correlates with our products.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Connelly with CLSA.", "Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "Steve, 2 things. When you bought Smurfit-Stone, you had some short-term people, expertise issues that slowed you down a little bit. As you think about the projects that you've got going on over the next couple of years, is that team fully in place, or do you still need to build? And the second question, I think I asked you last quarter about shifts we were hearing about from supermarkets in the timing of display activity. And I'm just curious whether you've had any different thoughts about that, given the performance this quarter, or if it's just weather and, et cetera?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Yes. I think we just -- on the -- your second question is just on displays, correct?", "Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "Yes. Yes, exactly.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I think primary demand for displays is very strong now. And I think it makes sense with the shifting shopping trends that when somebody goes into a store, that's an opportunity to promote your product. And we really haven't seen any change in that. I think with respect to our organization, our mill organization is strong. We're executing projects. I think Tom and Jim have done yeoman's work in strengthening the organization. On the container side, we also have significant improvement, but we would identify that we can do what we need to do. We'd like to have a little bit more depth on the bench and box plants than we have today. And that's a high focus for all of us.", "Operator", "We do have a follow-up question from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Two quick ones. First, with Hopewell, you've added a lot of optionality to the project, which looks like it'll pay off one way or another. Have you been doing any of that with Florence? I know the primary focus has been the woodyard. But will the project allow you over time to produce maybe a different sheet or produce more or lower cost over time? Any thoughts around that? And then with the EVOLs coming into the box network at a very steady pace, back before the acquisition, Smurfit had gone through a very large box plant transformation of sorts and had invested a fair amount, we thought, in EVOLs and upsizing their box plants. Did they just not do enough of it? Or are you finding more end markets and more opportunity to utilize EVOLs, hence, the investment?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Okay, just on -- with respect to Florence, the -- we call it the upstream, the pulping capacity and capability of Florence is -- will be a major strength of that location. I think as time passes, we're looking at the paper machines on a long-term basis. And that is something which is not an urgent need, but ends up being an opportunity for us longer term. With respect to the Smurfit's box plant transformation, I think they put in 6 EVOLs. Each EVOL, in round numbers, is about 0.5 billion square feet. So we're about a 75 billion-square-foot system and today, implemented about 3 billion square feet worth of EVOLs. We've seen an opportunity for us to invest in the converting capability, which I think other than the EVOLs, Smurfit did not focus on that as much as they did on the corrugators, which are in generally pretty good shape. So we're taking this opportunity to, I think, more fully implement the strategy we have to have low-invested box plants.", "Operator", "We do have a question from Joshua Zaret of Longbow Research.", "Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC", "Two questions. First, Steve, you said you had box plants on the West Coast. So I'd like to know, what is your exposure to the California ag market? And does the drought have any factor in your volume forecast for the year or even beyond that?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "We do serve the California agricultural market. And the impact is, I think, is more of a longer-term impact than immediate impact this year. So you can have -- might have some impact, but it's not a huge pack -- impact. The bigger issue is what happens longer term. Now there are certain commodities which are doing very strong. And I'll just point out that the strawberry season has been very strong. But I think just -- that's just that. So the short answer is, it's not a big impact on the outlook for this year, but it may have an impact in succeeding years.", "Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC", "Glad to hear that. Second question, people have been asking about, I guess, the more competitive environment in linerboard. I'd like to ask, have you seen any change in the amount of competitive bidding for the box business and maybe an increase in accounts changing hands relative to the last few quarters?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "No.", "Operator", "Our next question is a follow-up from Scott Gaffner with Barclays.", "Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Steve, just a follow-up on volumes. Did -- just a clarification. Do you have any economic downtime built into the June quarter? And then, second on your volume forecast for the full year. I think before, you said on the last quarter's call that you thought flat volumes for the year, obviously, we can't -- it'd be difficult to get to that number now. Can you just kind of give us a full year volume forecast at this point?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I'm just -- I'm not going to comment on whether we have plans to take economic downtime or not and just -- but it's, I think, with respect to our volumes, I think it wouldn't be surprising to have us around 1% to 2% below on the box system for the balance of the year.", "Operator", "Our final question is a follow-up from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Yes, so 2 follow-ups. First, Boiler MACT for 2016. As you sit today, do you have everything compliant, or is there more you need to do?", "James B. Porter", "This is Jim Porter. We have very good clarity on what we need to do from a Boiler MACT standpoint. And I guess, we're pleased to say that it's better than what we had originally looked at 1 or 2 years ago. And we'll be implementing those projects as needed. But it's fully scoped and all projects identified and...", "Steven C. Voorhees", "This has got probably the most significant project that we have, which is related to Boiler MACT is the project at Demopolis the biomass boiler, which we're really doing in lieu of complying with Boiler MACT with 2 very old turbine generators. That's a $60 million to $70 million investment, has very attractive returns on its own and has even more attractive returns if you back out the opportunity cost of what we would've had to invest in the turbine generators to comply with Boiler MACT. I think just in terms of a lump of capital, that's the most significant capital which is related to Boiler MACT.", "Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "If you look at requirements, not only your own, but as you've seen -- there's a lot quite [ph] across the industry that folks have to do, would you anticipate -- I mean, we've talked a lot about both in industry and on previous calls of things of extra capacity, and Jim, you laid out 1 million or so tons of capacity comes on stream. Do you anticipate there could be some capacity that ends up kind of slowly going away given the expense of keeping some of these things compliant, not only yourselves or with others throughout the industry? How do you think about that?", "James B. Porter", "I don't know that Boiler MACT alone is a driver for that. I think the ongoing capital costs and margins of the products, really, is the ultimate factor. But I wouldn't pin that on Boiler MACT.", "Operator", "We do have another follow-up question from Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just a few follow-ons. So on the volume, Steve and Jim, now you're saying minus 1% to 2% versus flat before. Can you pinpoint what's changed?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I think the biggest factor is we have another 3 months in the book to see just what the actual has been. I think we're not running our business to try and maximize volume. We're running our business to operate as efficiently as we can and serve our customers. So the volume is almost not a result of the implementation of our strategy. And I think that's what we're running now. And I'd just have to say that's probably the best indicator of what we're going to run over the next several months. But we'll see how we run in the next several months.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Very helpful, Steve. And then on the share buybacks. So in the context of your full year free cash flow guidance, can you help us with what we should expect the relevant range of share buyback may be?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "That's -- I think that has to get mixed into our overall opportunities and, I think, to put out a range would be just difficult for us to do. I think we do expect share buybacks to be a mechanism from which we'll make sure our shareholder returns stay -- we may use the word optimized as a result of making sure we've got the appropriate leverage on the business, which is our target leverage of 2x.", "Operator", "Thank you. And at this time, I'll turn the call back over to the speakers.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Okay. Thank you very much for your participation and interest, and we look forward to speaking with you in 3 months. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference.

Zaret - Longbow Research LLC", "F. Drake Johnstone - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the first quarter results conference call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Director of Investor Relations, Jason Thompson. Please go ahead.", "Jason Thompson", "Thanks, Rose, and good morning, everyone. John Luke, Bob Beckler and Mark Rajkowski are here to review our first quarter results, and we also have Bob Feeser here for Q&A as well.", "The notification for this call was broadly disclosed and is being webcast at mwv.com, where slides are also available. Our results and commentary are presented on a continuing operations basis and are correct as of today, but could include time-sensitive information that is subject to change. In addition, any statements that are forward-looking are subject to known and unknown risks and are not guarantees of future performance.", "I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Luke.", "John A. Luke", "Jason, thanks very much, and good morning to all of you. I'm pleased to report that we began the year well with first quarter results significantly better than last year. We had sales growth of 3% on a constant-currency basis. And we're in $0.23 per share on an adjusted basis compared to $0.09 per share during the same period last year, even with adverse weather-related impacts of $25 million during this quarter.", "As important, we increased profitability in each of our Packaging businesses. We're focused on ensuring that progress with our profitable growth strategy becomes even more evident in our bottom line performance, where we have targeted market-leading margins in each business. This includes expanding our commercial and innovation efforts to win in chosen global markets, capturing the value of our recent investments and getting more efficient and productive by reducing costs and improving manufacturing performance. I'm pleased to report that we delivered on each count in the first quarter, giving us confidence that we have the strategies in place to reach our immediate and longer-term performance goals. I'll touch on a few of the highlights for the first quarter that you'll hear more about as Bob Beckler and Mark Rajkowski share more detailed results.", "First, we're winning with our disciplined end market participation strategies, including market share gains, sales of innovative products and growth with top customers as they expand in key regions around the world. Our progress in these areas is evident in each of our businesses. It is particularly notable in the very positive results in Home, Health & Beauty. Under new leadership for this segment, adjusted EBITDA margins reached 14% in the first quarter due to expanded market participation with innovative high-margin products, a more productive manufacturing platform and a leaner cost structure. The progress in this business is sustainable, and you'll hear from Bob and Mark about how we expect to build on this performance to drive further improvement in this segment, as well as similar themes that led to margin expansion in Food & Beverage and industrial packaging compared to last year.", "Second, we're capitalizing on the recent investments in Brazil and in Covington, both of which had a meaningful positive impact on our results in the quarter and will help accelerate improvement this year. During the first quarter, we generated 24% EBITDA margins in Brazil, just shy of the range we've targeted for later in the year. The Tres Barras mill investment continues to drive margin improvement in the Industrial business, and we've also been effectively driving pricing increases for our innovative corrugated solutions and high-quality paperboard in Brazil.", "Looking at our other large capital investment, the biomass boiler in Covington, we generated towers throughout the quarter, which was at or above the capacity we expected, which led to an incremental $8 million of productivity in our Food & Beverage segment, very much on target with the returns planned for this project.", "Similar improvements were evident across our manufacturing system as we operated very well during the quarter, notwithstanding isolated disruptions from the severe storms in the southeastern United States.", "Third, we delivered on the expected elements of the margin improvement program we announced in January. We generated $9 million of savings in the quarter and completed actions that ensure we'll reach our goal of at least $75 million in savings this year. There's more we will accomplish as part of the cost discipline that's now ingrained across the company, as well as pending actions such as our decision to sell 2 small facilities in Europe. This decision is notable not for the size of the transactions, but for the determined focus that we have on improving margins by optimizing our mix of products and services.", "In all, we're encouraged by the continued progress across MWV and the momentum we've carried into the second quarter. We believe the impact of our strategy to win in global packaging markets, as well as in Specialty Chemicals is more evident now than it may have been in recent quarters when operating challenges masked our progress. For these reasons, we're confident we will deliver significantly improved earnings and cash flow for the full year.", "I'll now turn the call over to Bob Beckler for some additional commentary about our performance and outlook in each segment before Mark Rajkowski talks about the first quarter financials. Bob?", "Robert K. Beckler", "Thank you, John. The strong first quarter performance that John noted is a good indicator of the progress we are making, especially the margin expansion of each of the businesses. More to do to reach our goals, but we are confident given the progress we are making across the company with our market participation strategies, our manufacturing operations and our cost discipline. I'd now like to step through each of the segments with some brief highlights for the first quarter, as well as our outlook for further improvement in the second quarter and beyond.", "In Food & Beverage, earnings increased significantly on modestly higher sales. The negative $25 million weather impact that John mentioned at the outset was concentrated in this segment, largely resulting from higher fiber costs and availability issues at the mills, higher purchased energy costs, as well as interruptions to many of our customers' operations across the U.S. A more detailed breakdown is available in the slides that accompany this call.", "All in, EBITDA margin in the first quarter rose to 14%, up 180 basis points versus prior year. If not for the weather impact, EBITDA margin for Food & Beverage would have been another 300 basis points higher for the quarter.", "Despite the weather issues, solid operating performance, strong SBS and CNK board demand and our pricing and product mix strategies drove improved performance in Food & Beverage. Pricing was up by $22 million as the result of steady commercial efforts over the past year to price according to the value we deliver to customers. We continue to gain share with global brand owners and are making good inroads with innovative new products, such as Evertain and SmartFare, paperboard packaging products for snack foods and ready-to-eat meals, both of which will be launched this year.", "We are also benefiting from packaging machinery placements that have been a key part of our strategy to grow in global beverage markets, growing carton volumes when we secure these critical positions in our customers' bottling and fulfillment operations.", "In the first quarter, we had a particularly good win with machinery placement in Northern China, representing new geographic expansion, where our strategic customers are generating the majority of their growth.", "In the second quarter, we expect Food & Beverage profits to be significantly above last year's levels. Our paperboard order backlog should remain very strong, and we will continue to benefit from higher pricing across multiple product lines. Margins will also benefit from the ongoing productivity impact from our Covington biomass boiler, as well as lower outage expenses compared to last year.", "Turning to Home, Health & Beauty, sales in earnings were up strongly, and our 14% EBITDA margin increased by 350 basis points. This improvement is despite $3 million of unfavorable impact from our personal care folding carton businesses in Europe and Brazil, which we will be exiting fully in the second quarter as previously announced.", "As John mentioned, the solid progress in this segment is the result of our market participation strategies taking hold under new leadership, as well as improved operating performance and lower overhead costs.", "Across the range of our dispensing solutions for home cleaning, lawn and garden maintenance, health care, personal care and fragrance, we saw anywhere from 10% to 20% revenue growth compared to last year. We also had solid growth in our health care adherence solutions with the transition to our Shellpak Renew, and all paperboard package completed during the quarter.", "A great example of our progress in Home, Health & Beauty is in the fragrance market. We won a record number of new product launches over the past year, many of them with our innovative Melodie pump and new Emotions of Spray Collection. These launches have resulted in increased unit volume, up almost 25% compared to last year, which has contributed to our overall revenue and earnings improvement.", "We have positioned Home, Health & Beauty as a partner to major brand owners worldwide, and we are winning a sizable share of new product launches, not just in fragrance, but in all of our markets because of our increasing ability to deliver innovative solutions with a highly responsive global supply chain.", "In the second quarter, we expect Home, Health & Beauty earnings to be significantly higher than last year. We've seen strong demand continue into the second quarter and the drag on earnings from our European and Brazilian folding carton businesses will be substantially reduced as we complete the exit and focus on dispensing solutions.", "With our solidifying market positions globally, improved productivity and lower costs from our margin improvement activities, we are on a good path for a sustained, strong performance and improvement in this segment.", "In industrial packaging, dollar-based sales were down slightly, but earnings and margins increased significantly as we continued to ramp up the business following our major investments. Specifically in Brazil, sales were slightly down in dollars, but up 14% on a constant-currency basis, taking into consideration the devaluation of the Brazilian real.", "EBITDA margin during the first quarter grew to 24%, up 600 basis points year-on-year and just below the target of 25% to 30% that we expect to achieve by the end of this year.", "We continue to improve the performance of our expanded mill in Tres Barras, which has increased our supply of premium, quality kraft liner for internal use and external sales. The mill has achieved its design capacity, and we are making excellent progress optimizing costs, quality and output.", "In addition, the quality and value of our innovative corrugated packaging solutions have enabled us to increase pricing in order to offset significant inflation from rising fiber costs, labor and other input costs.", "In India, we continue to like the fundamentals of the corrugated packaging markets as the country continues to move toward modern retail and the middle class expands rapidly. Earnings in the short term have been a modest drag on overall segment profitability, but we see this as a long-term position ahead of the expected growth as we continue to optimize performance and capacity of the mill operation that we acquired about a year ago.", "Industrial segment profits are expected to improve strongly again in the second quarter versus last year. And beyond, with continued optimization of our investments in Brazil and India, increasing productivity and our commercial focus, we will continue to drive upward momentum for this segment.", "And finally, our Specialty Chemicals business continues to execute extremely well in driving growth and profitability in its key markets. Unfavorable market dynamics, specifically in the general pine chemicals sector, negatively impacted sales in the quarter, but were more than offset by growth and strong performance in our higher value applications for road paving, adhesives, oil drilling and activated carbon technologies. For the quarter, EBITDA margin remained very strong at 25%.", "In the second quarter, we expect segment profit in Specialty Chemicals to be modestly higher than the strong second quarter last year as we continue to leverage stronger positions in each of our high-end product lines.", "So to summarize, we are seeing solid improvement in Packaging and continued strong performance in Specialty Chemicals. We know that there's more work to be done, but clearly, we've established good momentum more broadly across the enterprise that we are confident can carry us toward our performance expectations.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Mark to discuss our financial results, including progress on the margin improvement actions we announced in January. Mark?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Thanks, Bob. As you've heard, we're off to a very good start in 2014. All of our business segments delivered earnings growth in the quarter, including substantial improvement in operating margins for each of our Packaging businesses.", "Building on the momentum we established in the fourth quarter of last year and through this first quarter, which is a seasonally slower period for many of our markets, we expect segment profit and cash flow to improve significantly in the second quarter and throughout this year. As John and Bob noted, our overall goal is to expand our margins and deliver market-leading profitability in each business.", "To accelerate our progress in achieving this goal, we announced specific actions in January to simplify organization design, refine our participation in some markets and resize our corporate cost relative to the revenue base following our Consumer & Office Products and forestland transactions.", "By the end of the first quarter, we had largely completed all of our actions, enabling us to achieve cost savings of $9 million. These savings were the primary driver of the 6% reduction in SG&A and resulted in 80 basis points of improvement to operating margin. The savings from this program will grow as we move through the year and reach at least $75 million in total savings by the end of 2014.", "Our improvement in the quarter, however, went far beyond our cost-reduction activities. We continue to build on a strong foundation of commercial success and significantly ramped up our operational execution to deliver solid, underlying financial performance for the quarter.", "Looking at sales revenue, we made tremendous progress on the pricing front, which was the largest driver of our currency-neutral sales growth of 3%. We continued to demonstrate the value of our differentiated innovative solutions with over $40 million of additional price and mix contribution in the quarter.", "During the quarter, we continued to build on our commercial successes with new share gains, led by the strong performance in Home, Health & Beauty, where sales volumes of our plastic pumps and dispensers grew 11% year-over-year.", "In the Food & Beverage segment, sales volumes were significantly impacted during the quarter by the extreme weather, which led to shipping and logistics challenges, as well as customers shutting down their operations during the storms. To give you some perspective, sales volumes were down 12% and 9% in January and February, respectively, but up 17% in March as the weather improved and our customers replenished their supply chains. Activity has continued near those levels so far in the second quarter.", "Adjusted EBIT increased 72% to $98 million, and EBIT margins increased 310 basis points to 7.4%. Adjusted gross margin represented the majority of the improvement, growing 240 basis points to 19% of sales, largely due to price and mix, as well as higher productivity as we've begun to realize the benefits from our renewed focus on manufacturing excellence to drive high-quality and highly efficient production and service.", "Our productivity efforts and increased operating leverage contributed $25 million to adjusted EBIT during the quarter, which includes the significant negative impact from weather. This reflects benefits from increased operating rates and lower cost per ton for our production at our Tres Barras mill in Brazil, as well as $8 million of benefits from the new biomass boiler at Covington.", "Finally, our cash on hand at the end of the quarter was approximately $330 million compared to just over $1 billion at year end. Approximately $525 million was used to return value to our shareholders, including the repurchase of shares and dividends. We also had to pay about $100 million of alternative minimum tax on the installment note from the forestland sale. We will recover this payment with AMT credits over the next 3 years.", "Our first quarter also includes the seasonal buildup of working capital for the busy spring and summer seasons for many of our businesses, including beverage, food service and home and garden. The build in working capital this year was exacerbated by the severe weather over the first 2 months of the quarter, which required us to produce and ship at near record levels in March to meet our -- to meet pent-up customer demand.", "We expect working capital to return to more normalized levels in the second quarter as operating conditions have improved. So we look ahead to further progress in the second quarter, we expect company earnings to be significantly higher than last year. Bob has detailed our outlook for each segment. Taken together, we expect higher earnings and cash flow as we enter the busier season for many of our businesses, benefiting from improved productivity, higher pricing and additional savings from our cost reduction programs.", "John, back to you.", "John A. Luke", "Mark, thanks very much. In conclusion, we're making progress, but our work is far from complete. We're executing on strategies that will drive higher earnings and cash flow from our businesses and greater returns to our shareholders. We look forward to reporting on continued success next quarter and for the balance of the year as we work to achieve market-leading margins in each of our businesses. We'd now be happy to answer any questions you might have and in addition to Bob Beckler and Mark Rajkowski, as Jason noted upfront, Bob Feeser is with us as well.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.", "Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "John, 2 things. You talked quite a bit about successes in value-based pricing. With respect to how much further you can go, where do you think you still have the biggest gaps in value-based pricing, whether is it specific customers\u2019 geographies or product categories? And then the second question, you've been winning for so long in Specialty Chemicals. I don't think anybody's target hasn't been beaten at this point. How clear are the opportunities to continue to grow that business and how dependent is it in, like, for saying -- for sake of China, is it really a function of a new market opening up for you?", "John A. Luke", "You've got a lot packed in there, Mark, and I will do my best and invite my colleagues to follow up because I think you've hit on key points we'd like to reinforce. First of all, we see significant upside across the board in terms of value-based pricing. Value-based pricing is really going to be a function of how well we engage through commercial excellence with our customers to continue to understand their discrete as well as broad-based needs, how well we meet them with quality and service and, importantly, how effectively we innovate our current -- improve our current offerings and bring new innovations to bear that help our customers grow in their markets. So whether it is a food marketplace, where we see significant potential, whether it's continuing innovation, growth in service supporting the beverage marketplace, which is growing nicely globally, and certainly, Home, Health & Beauty where, as we said, what you've just seen is the tip of the iceberg, we see significant potential and it's not only here, but it is global. So we look forward to -- I don't mean to say it's easy, but it -- we see significant upside potential, and it just reinforces the broader areas of the strategy that we're embarked on. With respect to Chemical, I think Bob Beckler highlighted a lot. But this is an excellent business. It's one where we see significant upside potential as we look at the global trends that are underway through here, again, through a combination of innovation and thoughtful investment to support expansion and participation in markets. We see significant upside potential both in terms of revenues, as well as underlying profitability. Mark, Bob?", "Robert K. Beckler", "Well, John, just picking up on Specialty Chemicals first, and then maybe an added comment on pricing. I think you said it well on Chemical. I don't think we should view that the business has popped out by any means, and we don't necessarily need a new breakthrough in that business to continue growing from the current base. The comments that I made in the prepared remarks were really to highlight that we continue to see tremendous upside in the higher-end premium part of that business that serves the specialized markets like asphalt, oilfield, adhesives and activated carbon markets. We still have a lot of capability there in terms of mix to shift from more of our general markets into the specialty markets there. Just coming back to the price question, we have pricing activity underway in all of our segments today. And I think what you saw in the first quarter was really largely carryover pricing from activities that occurred in 2013. So there's still more pricing benefit to come throughout the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America and Merrill Lynch.", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Previously, you had provided EBITDA guidance for this year, 1.025 to 1.075. Obviously, the weather hit things in the first quarter by about $25 million. Does that mean that we should be at 1 to 1.05 or are some of the other improving trends and performances enough that, in fact, you could potentially keep that range where it had been previously?", "John A. Luke", "Mark, I'll pass you over to Mark here to address your comments.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Mark, yes. Listen, we -- obviously, weather was not helpful this quarter. But as you saw, we recovered some of that in the quarter as a function of some of the outstanding work we've done in the commercial areas. Pricing really turning around our operating performance, starting to realize as we said we would the benefits from the investments that we've made in Brazil, in Covington. And with that, some real momentum that we're seeing in the underlying commercial markets, we still have good confidence in our ability to deliver on our full-year plan.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just sticking with the weather a little bit. I guess, the comps should be fairly easy, but last year, you had a pretty rough year with home and garden. I was just wondering, can you give any insight into maybe some of your most weather-exposed segments as you look at still kind of the colder [ph] spring in big parts of the country?", "John A. Luke", "Sure. Bob Beckler, you've been close to that.", "Robert K. Beckler", "Yes, I think from a Q1 results standpoint, most of the weather impact we would say was in the Food & Beverage segment for the reasons I outlined in my comments. There was minor impact across the other segments due to disruptions in logistics and customer activities and demand. And I think some of our customers would claim weather impacts to the consumer end in terms of consumer spending patterns during the first 2 months. But we saw a very strong bounce back in the month of March that encouraged us about the fundamentals of the markets that we were participating in, and that's continued forward into April. Specific to home and garden, weather is a -- it's a funny thing. It actually is the one thing that benefits us as we look forward because people will be out there buying more home and garden products, we believe, to repair the lawns and gardens that have been damaged by the foul weather this year.", "John A. Luke", "Yes, I think we'll see how the balance of the quarter goes. But all signs are based on early activity that we're seeing in the lawn and garden marketplace progress and momentum that, frankly, has been absent for the last few years.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then in terms of pricing, can you just remind us, you mentioned, obviously, a lot of what we saw in the first quarter was actions taken last year. Specifically in terms of the board markets, the activity that's currently being recognized in the market, when will we expect that flow through your results?", "John A. Luke", "Bob?", "Robert K. Beckler", "So, Gail, the actions that are widely published, we're certainly right there with them, and we really expect to see that start to flow through partially in the second quarter and certainly fully by the midyear point and onward through the year.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. But is there a major hang-up with contracted volume that you wouldn't start to see it until next year such as the resets that you saw going into '14?", "Robert K. Beckler", "Yes, there is some of that, which is why it will not be a step change as we go into Q2. There is contractual business that we have that we're benefiting from today as a result of the actions taken last year. So there is a bit of a lag that we'll continue to see and benefit that will carry forward into 2015.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And just one last question on Brazil. Can you just talk about what you're seeing in terms of the underlying market fundamentals given some of the challenges in the economy down there or some of it -- do you see a risk given some of the talk on energy? And how have you been dealing with that? I mean, have you been exporting more out of Brazil than maybe might have been in the initial plan? And if so, just how is that trending and how would you expect that to trend over the next few quarters?", "John A. Luke", "Bob, you're still up.", "Robert K. Beckler", "On Brazil, it's certainly been an interesting dynamic due to the factors, Gail, that you're pointing out well. I would say that we're executing quite well given the dynamic, and we always felt that we would have a lot of flexibility with our strategy. The investment that we made in the expansion of the Tres Barras mill, while ultimately intended to feed the growth and reintegration of our corrugated packaging business, it's something that we can manage with a lot of discipline over time so that we're creating the maximum value from the paperboard that we're producing, which I'll mention is going extremely well. We're very pleased with the quality and the level of differentiation that we're seeing with the paperboard in the markets. Your point around export is a good one. And actually, with the devaluation of the currency over the last year, that's aided the market dynamic in general. So we've been able to play that balance very nicely, I think, while keeping our religion about our market participation and keeping a good discipline around pricing as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.", "Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "It's actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. In Specialty Chemicals, did volume get any benefit from road repair work, given the increment weather in 1Q? Or do you expect any in 2Q?", "Robert K. Beckler", "Yes, great question. Very quick answer on that one. Q1 is seasonally low due to the colder weather, but we are seeing a strong pickup in orders heading into the Q2 as we would expect and maybe a little bit on the stronger side. Particularly good demand we're seeing in the Asian region in that business as we head into Q2.", "Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Great. And in Brazil, it seems like volumes underperformed the overall market during the quarter. What drove that? And also a competitor of yours recently reported mid-30% EBITDA margins there. Over the long term, is that achievable for Rigesa?", "Robert K. Beckler", "So on the volume side, it really goes back to the comments I made earlier to Gail's questions. We're really keeping a fundamental discipline going around pricing to offset inflation in Brazil, which, as you know, is escalating general inflation in the 6% to 7% range, and fiber costs in Brazil pressuring the industry as a whole are at historical highs. So the net balance has been, I would say, some volume pressure on the corrugated side of our business, but good movement of paperboard to offset the corrugated, so net-net on the quarter, a neutral position. Pricing was, obviously, necessary and a benefit to our performance in the quarter, and actions are still ongoing that will play through the remainder of the year. The profitability trajectory, we still see ourselves heading towards 30%. We'll be approaching that as we complete the year. We feel very good about how our strategy is playing out, and we think we'll be right up there in terms of the peer set in Brazil as we get into 2015.", "Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And just one last one. Are you expecting any lingering impact from weather on 2Q earnings at all?", "John A. Luke", "Yes, very modest, very modest on the buck [ph] side.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America and Merrill Lynch.", "John P. Babcock - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "This is actually John sitting in for George, sorry about that. Just have a quick question with regards to comments. I was just wondering, can you remind us on the return you're expecting from that project?", "John A. Luke", "Bob Feeser, you've been a part of all of that. Why don't you pick it up by commenting broadly on the trajectory and what we're seeing on the bottom line already?", "Robert A. Feeser", "John, this is Bob Feeser. We're still targeting mid-teens for that project in terms of returns, and we feel that we're on a very good pace and track to deliver that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.", "Unknown Analyst", "This is Usha Gunthapally [ph] on behalf of Alex. First question, are you seeing any increased competition for your paperboard in any of the markets from tonnage outside of North America?", "John A. Luke", "It's John. Let me comment broadly on -- if I understand the question fully. I think what we're seeing is that the positions we have targeted and are actively pursuing through our commercial strategies have minimized the competitive exposure we've had to capacity additions that have occurred or excess capacity that exists in certain markets. And I think one that we watch most closely over the last few years has been China, where there's been a significant increase in board production. But again, the specialized market positions we've worked to develop most notably in high-end tobacco and liquid packaging have insulated us. We don't take that insulation for granted. We work very hard through innovation and performance to protect it. So I think our strategy is serving us well.", "Unknown Analyst", "That's helpful color. And just for the Industrials business, what is the run rate sales or EBITDA you expect out of this business in 2014? You talked about margin, but I'm just curious, like around sales [ph] or EBITDA?", "John A. Luke", "Which segment? I'm sorry.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Industrial.", "John A. Luke", "Industrial, okay. Bob?", "Robert K. Beckler", "Mark, you commented...", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "We're at 24%. And as we said we expect to be and Bob just mentioned as well, we expect to be moving towards 30% by the end of this year.", "Unknown Analyst", "Got it. And one last one and I'll turn it over. So for Home, Health & Beauty segment, a nice margin improvement in the first quarter, is this a good run rate to use for rest of the year?", "John A. Luke", "I think we feel like it's certainly a good start to the year. But we still have some work to do in that segment. We believe there's still some upside to the profitability. So 14% EBITDA. That's a business that we would expect to reach the 17 range over time, and we're well on our way to reaching that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of James Armstrong with Vertical Research.", "James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "My first one is on the Home, Health & Beauty segment. With that segment doing significantly better especially in pricing, are you rethinking the size of your cost reduction programs in Home, Health & Beauty?", "John A. Luke", "Let me comment at the outset. I think we feel that our cost-reduction initiatives, importantly, our margin expansion initiatives, which include a healthy combination of cost reduction and pricing discipline, supported by actions in the marketplace, as well as innovation strategies, very much on target, and we're not, in any way, lessening our resolve there. And I think, as Bob Beckler has commented, we see we have a number of things to continue to do, and we see significant continuing upside potential in that business. And Bob?", "James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Very good. And then switching gears, we've heard a lot about transportation issues from multiple other companies given the rough winter. Could you help us quantify what the transportation impact in the quarter was? And are you seeing that improve at all?", "John A. Luke", "Bob Feeser, do you have a comment...", "Robert A. Feeser", "Yes. This is Bob Feeser. On that point, so we announced $25 million of weather-related impacts. Transportation was a smaller portion of that in our -- across our operations. We certainly did have some challenges with both rail and truck, primarily truck, in several of our operations. But we've actually seen some improvement as we moved into the second quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.", "Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just, I guess, a higher level question just to start on in Food & Beverage. Have you seen fundamental shift in buying behavior on the consumer side, which is responsible for the uptick that you're seeing right now after a couple of years of struggle?", "Robert K. Beckler", "This is Bob Beckler, Paul. I'll start the answer to that one, and invite others to join in. I think, I wouldn't say that there has been a step change, but I think we're making excellent progress in terms of how we think about our participation in those markets. We worked very hard over the last couple of years to sharpen our participation and deepen our insights into where to play in general in both Food & Beverage that I think have benefited us a lot, even when the market conditions have not always been so favorable. Having said that, there are some bright spots that we see, and just to name a few, on the bleached board side, generally, positive trend in cup and plate food service items, as paperboard is gaining some share against plastic and foam, would be one example. We participate in the liquid packaging markets with high-quality paperboard, and that's probably the fastest-growing application today for bleached paperboard. And on the beverage side, while there are some challenges in terms of the market fundamentals in North America around carbonated softdrinks, we're actually performing well in both carbonated softdrinks, and I would say especially, globally, on beer. So I think it's not a step change just to sum it up, but more of a continuation of the excellent progress that we're making, and really the focused commercial discipline that we have.", "John A. Luke", "Yes. I think Bob you've nailed that well, and I would just use this as an opportunity to say that I think our extended team has really, in each of these areas and around the globe, has really invested heavily in understanding the markets and the markets' dynamics very carefully and very well. So that the things, the ideas, the projects, the products we're bringing to market are targeted just that much more carefully to areas where we can achieve a volume and pricing improvement that we value.", "Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just on Home, Health & Beauty, I got the improvement of 350 basis points. What was the European beauty drag?", "John A. Luke", "The drag was between Europe and Brazil as we transitioned there with 150 basis points.", "Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, that's great. And you outlined lower tobacco sales down 10%. Is that a sign of a global contraction in cigarette consumption?", "John A. Luke", "No, I think there are some unusual circumstances here. Bob Feeser will comment on that.", "Robert A. Feeser", "Yes, I think it's more of a reflection of timing. So going into the fourth quarter of 2013, we had a number of customers that built some inventory, in particular, in Japan and in Korea, where there were some new tax regulation that was impacting in the fourth quarter. So some of what we saw in the first quarter was definitely timing-related and inventory readjustments in the first quarter. We continue to see actually very robust demand in the tobacco market, in particular, in the China tobacco market as we head into the second quarter. So our backlogs in that business are actually quite strong.", "Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So overall, I guess, the information you guys have got on in terms of tobacco business global growth, is that still positive sort of in the 2% to 3% growth range?", "Robert A. Feeser", "We probably would have it maybe a notch below that, maybe 1% to 3%, in that range. But again, where we're targeting to participate is really in the premium end of, in particular, of the China tobacco market, where there is still robust growth and we're well positioned to take advantage of that.", "Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And just last question. Any news on joint -- your JV's online development?", "John A. Luke", "Steady as you go, I think we're off to a very good start. And nothing significant to report at this stage of the game. But everything is going well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Zaret with Longbow Research.", "Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC", "A few questions, quickies. The $75 million cost reduction program, which you say is completed, can you tell us what the number of headcount reduction is and what the expected savings from that is?", "John A. Luke", "Bob?", "Robert K. Beckler", "Joshua, the headcount reduction is, as we reported in the first quarter, in the 500 range.", "John A. Luke", "That is the bulk of the savings coming from headcount.", "Robert K. Beckler", "That's right.", "Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC", "And that's like the 500 million or -- excuse me, 75. Okay, got that. Second question, you didn't say much about adherence packaging on this call. Can you tell us what's going on there and where it stands in terms of -- I guess, where it stands in priorities to the firm at this point?", "John A. Luke", "Well we're continuing to make progress on adherence. We've been at this now for several years. And it's one where we see really a tremendous amount of potential that still has yet to fully take hold for us. But we're still optimistic about the potential in that market. It's one that requires a real transformation in terms of how medications are dispensed. And we're at the forefront of that activity. But I think that's not going to be an overnight step-up in performance, but more of a slow and steady climb, and we're making progress.", "Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC", "Are the issues the FDA, is it the Wal-Mart, I mean, what is holding up the progress?", "John A. Luke", "Josh, I think, it's best to say that the regulatory environment is one that has afforded the change of the magnitude and pace that we and, frankly, I think others in the broader marketplace who would perhaps see the benefits from an adherence standpoint would like to see. So it's less retail. Wal-Mart has been a very good and effective partner for us in that business.", "Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Next question, you talked about fiber cost in Brazil escalating. Now you have one of the finest fiber bases in Brazil and so on. But -- so question is, how integrated are you to this mill and are your fiber costs going up? Is it a log and haul going up or are you protected on your fiber cost?", "John A. Luke", "Bob?", "Robert K. Beckler", "It's a great question, Joshua. On virgin fiber, we're in excellent shape. We really do have a nice position with our highly productive forestlands in Brazil. And with the expansion of the mill that we referenced, we've been able to take advantage more fully of that, that fiber base. But there is still a component of purchased fiber in our business. I would say we're probably less exposed to -- than others in the industry, and that's the recycle OCC fiber that I was referencing earlier that is up about 40% to 45% from what we were paying 1 year ago. And that is the fiber material that we used to produce the medium grade paperboard for our corrugated products.", "Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC", "Would it be fair to guess that maybe OCC is about 10% of your furnish down there?", "Robert K. Beckler", "Maybe a little more than that, considering our paper balance because the medium is largely OCC. So I would say more in the 15% to 20% range.", "Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Then I have to ask, what percentage, medium versus linerboard -- or, yes, what percentage medium versus linerboard?", "Robert K. Beckler", "It's about a 3:1 ratio.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Drake Johnstone with Davenport.", "F. Drake Johnstone - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division", "A question I have for you, based on your commentary, it looks like you'll move to positive cash from operations in the second quarter. It seems like your CapEx in the first quarter is trending lower than on a -- if we had -- multiply that times 4 based on your annual guidance of $350 million CapEx. So wonder if you had some thoughts on cash flow and free cash for the year. It looks like it's sort of back-end weighted. And also going into fiscal '15, can we see CapEx potentially down as low as $300 million?", "John A. Luke", "Mark, do you want to take that?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, I think our cash flow is back-end loaded. First quarter is very seasonal. It's a smaller quarter for us. We build working capital in the quarter to service our customers in the busy second, third quarter. We do expect to be positive in Q2 and for the full year. In terms of CapEx, we do spend a little bit more slowly in the first part of the year. It's a little bit heavier in the second half. We're still expecting to hit that roughly the $350 million. And as we get closer to -- through this year, we can give you more perspective in terms of how we're thinking about CapEx for '15.", "F. Drake Johnstone - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division", "And then my other question in your business in India, is that essentially a breakeven business this year or do you expect that to be mildly dilutive?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Essentially breakeven, slightly positive from an EBITDA perspective.", "Jason Thompson", "Thanks, Rose. I think that's our last question. Can you please give out the replay information?", "Operator", "Yes. Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be made available for replay after 12:00 p.m. Eastern today until May 30, 2014 at midnight. You may access the AT&T Executive Playback Service at any time by dialing 1 (800) 475-6701 and entering access code 323581. International participants may dial 1 (320) 365-3844.

At this time, we would like to welcome everyone to the RockTenn Third Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, slides are being presented today as part of the conference call. These slides can be accessed at www.rocktenn.com under the Investors page. Ladies and gentlemen, this call is being recorded today, July 30. [Operator Instructions]", "Your speakers for today's call are Mr. Steve Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Ward Dickson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Voorhees, you may begin your conference.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Thanks, Wendy. Welcome to those of you are listening to the call. This is Steve Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer. I'm joined this morning by Ward Dickson, Chief Financial Officer; Jim Porter, President of our Paper Solutions Business; and Mike Kiepura, President of our Packaging Solutions Business.", "During the course of the call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discuss during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent 10-K and the 10-Qs filed for the quarters ending December 31, 2013, and March 31, 2014.", "We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We've provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation. The slide presentation is available on our website.", "I'll start by discussing our operating results, and then Ward will discuss our balance sheet, pension and other financial measures. I'll complete our prepared remarks with comments on our outlook. Then Ward, Jim, Mike and I will be available for your questions.", "Our team delivered solid operating results in the June quarter. We're improving quality, service, reliability and productivity in our mills, as well as in our corrugated box, folding carton and other converting operations. These operating improvements are driving our improved financial results.", "Adjusted earnings were $1.97 per share, and free cash flow for the quarter was $206 million or $2.82 per share. Our free cash flow for the last 12 months was $12.39 per share. This is 35% higher than the prior year.", "Over the last 12 months, our credit agreement EBITDA has increased by 19% to $1.6 billion. This is over $250 million higher than 1 year ago.", "We completed the acquisition of the Tacoma mill on May 16. The mill is performing quite well and has set a new production record in May. Tacoma's internal and external sales of $44 million or 62,000 tons contributed $0.10 to adjusted earnings in the June quarter. We're ahead of schedule on the realization of our expected synergies from the acquisition. We expect the synergies from the acquisition to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million annually. We've been very pleased with the enthusiasm and performance of our coworkers at the Tacoma mill.", "Our Merchandising Displays business achieved organic sales and income growth of greater than 20% compared to the prior year quarter, due to a strong promotional environment and our service offering focused on value and innovation.", "In April, we created our paper solutions and packaging solutions business units to serve our customers better and simplify the way we do business. We're better structured to provide our customers with a set of packaging and promotional solutions that best fit their needs. In the 3 months since this new customer-facing structure was put in place, we've seen very good momentum. We've had several new business wins that likely would not have occurred without this new structure. This new structure is fostering better internal collaboration and customer focus.", "On Monday, we announced a 2-for-1 stock split that will increase our outstanding shares to approximately 143 million. The split will take effect on August 27. The fourth fiscal quarter adjusted EPS and full year cash flow guidance that I'll give later in this call reflects the stock split.", "We're delivering very strong current cash flow returns for our shareholders, have significant flexibility to improve these returns by deploying this cash flow to implement our operating strategy and by returning this capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.", "Sales for the quarter of $2,531,000,000 set an all-time record for our company. For the first time, our quarterly sales have exceeded $2.5 billion.", "$1.97 in adjusted EPS reflects a very good quarter. For comparative purposes, last year's June quarterly adjusted EPS of $2.16 included a $0.10 benefit from the successful renegotiation of our steam contract with Seminole mill, as well as a $0.17 per share benefit from an effective book tax rate of only 30% due to certain tax items recorded in the June quarter of last year.", "Our total company credit agreement EBITDA margin over the last 12 months is 16.8%, about 200 basis points higher than the 14.7% for the 12 months ending June of 2013. We recorded a $0.08 benefit this quarter related to the additional value from spare parts at our former Smurfit containerboard mills. We also recorded a $0.03 benefit due to a reduction in pension expense that reflected positive experience from our recently completed annual actuarial report.", "In total, for fiscal year '14, we expect our pension expense to be approximately $7 million lower than our previous estimates. April's black liquor intrusion at the West Point mill negatively impacted results in the quarter by approximately $0.08 per share.", "Our balance sheet continues to be in great shape. Our leverage ratio of 1.9x is consistent with our 2x target and also with the 1.9x to 2x range that I gave when I spoke publicly in early June.", "Turning to our Corrugated Packaging segment. Industry containerboard mill operating rates averaged 96.3% for the quarter, higher than the March quarter rate of 95.6% and slightly lower than last year's June quarter operating rate of 97%. Our containerboard mill operating rate for the quarter was 97%, higher than March quarter -- March quarter's rate of 94.1% and lower than the prior year number of 98.5%.", "Our containerboard mill system downtime in the quarter was 89,000 tons, primarily due to the scheduled maintenance and capital outages at Hopewell, Stevenson, La Tuque and Hodge. Industry production of containerboard for export markets increased by more than 4% from the prior year and increased 9.8% on a sequential quarter basis. RockTenn's export shipments of 284,000 tons increased by 17,000 tons or about 6% sequentially and 71,000 tons or about 33% over the prior year. We shipped approximately 55% of our export shipments to Latin America, 25% to the Middle East and 10% each to Europe and Asia. Export pricing was up on a sequential basis in both Europe and Latin America and flat in the Middle East and Asia. Our 311,000 tons of domestic sales containerboard were 55,000 tons more than the March quarter and flat with last year.", "Our third quarter containerboard inventories declined by approximately 12,000 tons. At the end of June, our containerboard inventory was about 4.5 weeks of consumption or about 0.5 week higher than we ran 2 years ago. We expect to continue to maintain these levels of inventory to support our business and our customer needs.", "In the corrugated box business, we continue to see the results of our strong focus on operational improvements in our box plant system. Over the past 3 years, we've closed 21 facilities, and our volume per plant has increased 8.9% from June of 2012.", "Our goal is to satisfy our customers every time. We're focused on improving quality as we increase productivity. We use customer satisfaction surveys in our business to monitor our success. Our latest survey results indicate improvement in many of our corrugated container metrics, including overall satisfaction and quality. As such, our customers are recognizing the improvements and investments that we're making.", "Two key metrics that we monitor are on-time delivery and quality. Both of these metrics year-to-date have improved over the prior year. In addition, capital investments and Lean Six Sigma efforts at our plants have improved our waste and product quality. Year-to-date, our average net waste has declined by 5% from last year's -- from last fiscal year's average. Our corrugator, flexo folder gluer and rotary die cutter productivity have increased year-to-date on average by 2%, 4% and 7%, respectively, all over last year's fiscal year average, reflecting the positive strides we're making in these areas.", "We've completed the scheduled installation of our box plant operating system in our U.S. plants in the June quarter. We're well positioned to implement and sustain additional operating improvements across our box plant system.", "During the June quarter, we successfully installed new EVOL flexo folder gluers in our Syracuse, New York, New Lenox, Illinois and Covington, Georgia box plants. Each of the 3 plants is operating more efficiently as a result of the new equipment, as well as producing higher-quality boxes. We will install an additional 2 EVOLs during this fiscal year, bringing the total number of installs in 2014 to 7. In fiscal 2015, we will continue the modernization of our box plant system by installing 10 EVOLs.", "Industry box volumes on a per day basis, as reported by the Fiber Box Association, increased 1% in the June quarter but declined 0.8% in the month of June alone, both as compared to the prior year. When I spoke publicly in early June, I said that we thought our June quarter box shipments would be up as compared to the March quarter but down as compared to last year. This proved to be correct as our domestic box shipments were up 3.4% on a per day basis versus the March quarter and down 2% against the prior year. Approximately 1/3 of the decline year-over-year is due to the fewer number of box plants that we're operating. The rest of the decline can be largely attributed to our focus on profitability over volume.", "The net result of the quarter was an increase in Corrugated Packaging segment sales to $1.77 billion, up 3.2% over last year's June quarter, with overall prices increasing by $13 per ton, more than offsetting reduced volumes from our closed box plants. Corrugated Packaging segment EBITDA margin for the June quarter was 17.4%, an improvement of 220 basis points over the March quarter. We expect for the September quarter that volumes will be flat to slightly down on a sequential basis and down approximately 2% to 3% compared to the prior year quarter. This is a continuation of recent trends, which have been the direct result of our commercial decisions, our plant closures and soft demand in specific end-use markets, including food, beverage and pizza markets.", "Turning to our Consumer Packaging segment. SBS industry backlogs as of July 16 were healthy at 578,000 tons. RockTenn's SBS backlogs now stand at 7 weeks. CRB industry backlogs as of July 16 were 124,000 tons, about 60,000 tons less than a year ago. RockTenn's CRB backlogs stand at approximately 3 weeks. We took no economic downtime at our CRB and SBS mills during the quarter.", "We took our mini maintenance outage at Demopolis in April. The cost of the April Demopolis outage was approximately $0.03 per share.", "In our Consumer Packaging segment, total sales were up 3.1%, and segment EBITDA was basically flat with the prior year. We expect our results in Consumer Packaging for the full year fiscal '14 to be in line to slightly above our prior year results. Demand for July remained strong for SBS and stable for both folding cartons and CRB.", "Our $11 million project to install a new printer and die cutter for our Nicholasville, Kentucky folding carton plant was completed in mid-May, on time and on budget. We've delivered exceptional results, including setting a new production record in the first full month of operation. We're making comparable investments in our Knoxville and Clinton folding carton plants over the course of the next year. These investments generate attractive returns by increasing productivity; reducing waste; reducing maintenance and repair spending; and in the case of Knoxville and Clinton, provide the capability to meet customer growth requirements.", "Merchandising Displays achieved record sales of $225 million in the quarter as compared to $166 million last year. The NPG acquisition contributed $17 million of the approximate $60 million in incremental revenue. Segment EBITDA margins of 11.3% were lower than what we would expect, as there's been incremental costs associated with onboarding the large volumes of new business into our system. The promotional environment continues to remain very healthy, with consumer products companies finding more ways to differentiate their products in store, including multi-vendor promotional displays and major redesigns of existing display programs.", "During the June quarter, we supported Pfizer's rollout of new Nexium 24HR over-the-counter heartburn medication. We worked with Pfizer's team for 2 years to design, develop, produce and distribute 160,000 temporary promotional displays to their U.S. retail network. We expect slightly lower sales and also to maintain margins in the Merchandising Displays business in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter.", "Our Recycling segment volumes were approximately 14% lower than last year, due primarily to the prior closures of 10 underperforming recycling plants since February 2013 and also due to the generally soft global recovered fiber markets.", "Segment income of $2.1 million was flat with last year. We expect to invest about $5 million in the Recycling business in fiscal year '15. The $5 million compares to $11 million in annual depreciation and the $11 million in capital expenditures we've averaged in the past 3 years.", "Ward will now discuss various financial aspects of our business. Ward?", "Ward H. Dickson", "Thank you, Steve. During the quarter, we realized the benefit of price increases in our business of $44 million as compared to the prior year. Average selling prices in the Corrugated Packaging segment were $13 per ton higher than last year. Average selling prices in Consumer Packaging were $51 per ton higher than the prior year, with gains in SBS and CRB increasing by $74 per ton and $16 per ton, respectively. The net impact of volume changes was a positive $1 million. The estimated inflationary impact of commodities was $33 million higher than the previous year, with lower recycled fiber costs and board costs only partially offsetting higher virgin fiber, energy and freight costs. Recycled fiber costs were approximately $11 per ton lower than last year's fiscal quarter and about $4 per ton lower than the March quarter, as the extremely wet weather during the winter and spring carried into the June quarter. Natural gas costs averaged almost $0.60 per MMBtu higher than last year.", "Other manufacturing and SG&A cost, which includes direct labor, repair and maintenance and indirect manufacturing costs, among other items, increased by $22 million. Quarterly productivity improvements of $21 million include cost reduction projects in areas such as procurement and logistics; as well as Six Sigma projects, the majority of which improved operating efficiency, reliability and quality at our manufacturing locations; and the impact of capital projects that reduced costs.", "Finally, the Tacoma mill and Retail Solution acquisitions contributed $10 million in segment income during the quarter.", "The $32 million in higher expense in other items category is comprised of the $13 million for the Seminole energy contracting gas savings, $9 million for the West Point black liquor intrusion, $2 million for increased outage amortization and other items, partially offset by the $9 million related to the additional value from spare parts at our former Smurfit containerboard mills.", "During the quarter, we generated free cash flow of $206 million. Over the last 12 months, we have generated free cash flow of $12.39 per share. Our biggest use of cash during the quarter was $341 million for the purchase of the Tacoma mill. We financed the acquisition under our accounts receivable securitization facility, which has an annual borrowing cost of less than 1%.", "We repurchased 206,000 shares in the June quarter at an average price of approximately $101. Cumulatively under our 5 million share repurchase authorization, we have repurchased 766,000 shares at an average price of approximately $96.", "At the end of June, our net debt was approximately $2.95 billion. Our LTM credit agreement EBITDA was over $1.6 billion, and our credit agreement debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.9x. We have more than $1.5 billion in liquidity available to us for general corporate purposes.", "Let me highlight some key assumptions for the fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate for the June quarter of 36.4% was in line with our expectations. We expect a tax rate for the fourth quarter of between 36% and 38%. At June 30, we have recorded unused U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating losses and tax credits that can be used to offset a total of $361 million in cash taxes. We expect to use our remaining U.S. federal net operating losses during the September quarter. We will use our remaining U.S. federal tax benefit of $235 million in cellulosic biofuel, Alternative Minimum Tax and other federal tax credits during fiscal year 2015 and 2016. Based on current assumptions, we estimate our cash taxes at approximately $10 million to $15 million in the fourth quarter and $20 million to $25 million for the full year. We estimate, based on our current earnings forecast and tax credit position, a cash tax rate of approximately mid-teens percent in fiscal 2015 and mid-20s percent in fiscal 2016.", "The September quarter is our lightest pension quarter, and we expect to make only $6 million in cash contributions this quarter. Last evening, the Senate removed the pension smoothing benefit from the House version of the highway funding bill. So any possible benefit from pension smoothing appears to be in question at this time.", "As an update to our CapEx guidance, we expect that our 2014 capital expenditures may be slightly higher than our $550 million guidance, perhaps as high as $575 million, reflecting the Tacoma acquisition and other items. Steve will talk about our forecast for 2015 capital expenditures in his closing remarks.", "We are not planning any major scheduled maintenance downtime during the September quarter.", "Now I will turn it back over to Steve, who will discuss our business and outlook.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Thanks, Ward. We're seeing a mix of business conditions across our operations. Within Consumer Packaging, we have good supply and demand balance in SBS. CRB markets are stable in light of the announced closure of the Fusion mill last week. Folding carton operations are stable. The corrugated box business continues to operate well with decent demand. Containerboard and box pricing is competitive and stable.", "In mid-July, we took steps to balance our production with our customer demand by taking economic downtime at 2 of our corrugating medium machines, one in Jacksonville, the other at West Point. The Jacksonville and West Point medium machines produce approximately 15,000 tons each per month of corrugating medium. We expect we will export more tons in the September quarter than the June quarter. We believe that wood costs will decline in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter and that recycled fiber costs will be flat or slightly up.", "With all that being said, we expect our September quarter adjusted EPS, after our 2-for-1 stock split, to be in the range of $1 to $1.10 per share. We expect to generate over $1.70 per share in free cash flow in the quarter, putting us at or slightly above $6 per share in free cash flow for the year. The $1.70 and $6 reflect the stock split.", "We're finalizing our CapEx plans for fiscal 2015 and expect capital expenditures next year of approximately $500 million. Two of our key projects are the Demopolis biomass boiler and the Stevenson pulp mill upgrade. The $68 million Demopolis project is underway, and the expected startup is January 2016. This project will enable us to install new renewable energy technology instead of spending $27 million on Boiler MACT compliance for 2 1950s vintage power boilers. When finished, the biomass boiler will be Boiler MACT compliant and will drive $10 million per year in savings in purchased electricity, fuel and reduced operating costs.", "We're investing approximately $46 million to upgrade the Stevenson pulp mill. When complete, we expect to generate after-tax returns in excess of 25% through reduced fiber and chemical usage and lower maintenance expenses, offset by slightly higher energy usage.", "Perry Capital published a letter last week discussing the opportunity to create master limited partnerships for virgin containerboard mills. We've been investing and are continuing to invest the time and resources necessary to evaluate this complex structure. Once we've reached a conclusion on the merits, we will communicate it as appropriate.", "I remain confident in our ability to provide our shareholders with strong current cash flow returns and our ability to improve those returns by deploying our free cash flow to further develop our strategy and by returning this capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.", "Ward, Jim, Mike and I are now available to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research Group.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Steve, question for you on the last comment on using cash. So far, you haven't been buying back stock particularly aggressively. But of course, you did just complete the Tacoma acquisition. Is that the main reason why share repurchase has been at a relatively slow rate? And assuming there isn't another acquisition that comes soon, would in all likelihood the rate of share repurchase accelerate?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I think your premise is correct. I think we have found opportunities to deploy capital to support our business. We're very happy with both the Tacoma and NPG acquisitions. Our target leverage is 2. We're very well within that range and I think it ends up being a balance of the opportunities we have versus share repurchase. I do have a preference for improving our business over share repurchase since I think it generates better long-term returns for our shareholders.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "And then one real quick follow-up, if I could. You'd indicated that in the September quarter, you're expecting box volumes to be down 2% to 3% for you year-over-year. Is -- do we begin to see a leveling off of that or where you can start to be performing more in line with the industry, if we go a quarter or 2 out in your expectation?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Yes. That would be our expectation.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "And can you provide a little bit more color on that? Or you want to just stick with that at this point?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I'd just as soon stick with that. I think we'll see the results, but I think that is our expectation, and we'll see as we report out how we do on that. But that -- our expectation is not to level off, and it would be a -- just a direct result of what we're doing in our box business. We're very comfortable with the execution we have on our box business. We've been working very hard to improve the capabilities. And we feel like we've been successful and I think we're going to continue to be successful.", "Operator", "The next question is from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "My 2 questions: First, maybe piggybacking on Mark's last topic. Can you comment as to what the reorganization on the commercial side in terms of paper solutions and packing solution -- packaging solutions should afford you in terms of volume growth? And kind of related to your point there, you're still seeing weakness in your box volumes for reasons you've discussed before, in the upcoming quarter, of down 2% to 3%. When should we start to see any meaningful benefit from the new commercial strategy affecting your volume? What would the volumes have been otherwise without this reorganization? And then I had a follow-on.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "George, Mike leads our packaging business. I'm going to let Mike respond to that question.", "Michael E. Kiepura", "Sure. George, I think the organization has only been in place since mid-April. But I would say in the first -- really now 3.5 months, been very encouraged by the greater cooperation among our various business segments, by the reception by our customer base to that different organization and bringing the full capabilities of the -- enterprise-wide capabilities of RockTenn to our customer base. So I'd say we've seen some early and significant wins in the marketplace that will take a few months to onboard as we transition that business on. So we're encouraged and think that in fiscal '15, we'll see positive year-over-year volume improvement.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. If I could ask a clarification and a follow-on. Mike, is it possible to gauge at this juncture what the current wins here? I think you mentioned 3 means from a volume standpoint. And then on CapEx, you mentioned that capital spending would be higher. We had assumed and you mentioned that a lot, it was Tacoma. You said, Steve, that there might be some other elements behind that. What are the other elements, if you can disclose in terms of the potential nudging up on the CapEx?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Just, George, to your question on the CapEx refers to our 14...", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Yes, correct.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "It's going to be Tacoma. And I think we've been successful in completing the projects on the converting side, probably a little bit faster than we thought. But if you had to pick one item, that would be Tacoma.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And on the wins?", "Michael E. Kiepura", "I think, George, it's really hard to say how we would have done if we hadn't changed the organization versus how we have because that's pretty hypothetical. But I would say that we've got very positive momentum building, and I think more than we would have had otherwise.", "Operator", "The next question is from Scott Gaffner with Barclays.", "Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I was hoping maybe we could discuss a little bit some of the recent shipment data -- some of the data points that you gave in your box shipments versus the industry, but also maybe box shipments versus corrugated shipments. Because if we look year-to-date, right, you mentioned box shipments down but the containerboard consumption numbers are actually up. And you've got this Merchandising Display business, which I assume consumes a large portion of your containerboard. Can you just sort of talk about your general thoughts on the overall health of the containerboard business, including these nontraditional box markets, and how you see that?", "James B. Porter", "This is Jim Porter. Just to clarify your question, you're asking how is the overall containerboard business performing in the global market relative to supply, demand, is that your question?", "Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Well, in the aggregate, there's obviously some nontraditional markets that consume some containerboard. And yet, we talk about box shipments a lot. I'm just wondering if you think that the overall health of the market is better than what's apparent in the box shipment numbers?", "James B. Porter", "I think globally, the containerboard and packaging business is really quite solid. We've got a global containerboard market -- round numbers, 150 million tons. And we have certain markets that are doing better than others certainly, as you would expect from the variety of the economic conditions in those countries. But North America box demand's relatively flat. Global production -- or production in North America for global consumption up 4%, 5%. So we generally have what I would say is a positive structure within the containerboard business. In our markets, we match our supply with our customer demand. Fortunately, we've got a big system and we've got a big portfolio of international customers, so we're able to take advantage of the markets of the world as they improve or flex accordingly. So we think it's a very healthy business, and we're continuing to be quite excited about it.", "Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then just looking at the converting operations for a minute. You continue to roll out the EVOL machine. You now have the box plant operating system in place. Can just talk a little bit about some of the qualitative benefits of having maybe the box plant operating system in place, as well as some of the quantitative benefits of having both of those initiatives going on?", "Michael E. Kiepura", "Well, from the EVOL standpoint and our focus on improving our operations, Steve mentioned in his talk about the improvement in terms of lower waste and better productivity on our corrugators, flexo folder gluers and rotary die cutters. And I think we'll continue to see those kind of improvements as we continue to invest in more EVOLs and other capital projects on the corrugated side of the business. So I think that continues to be very positive.", "Operator", "The next question is from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc.", "Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "One question on the additional containerboard capacity in North America. How would you -- Jim, how would you characterize the impact that it's having on your business specifically, in light of the downtime that Steve just talked about at 2 of the medium machines?", "James B. Porter", "Okay. Clearly, we're all aware that there's been the conversion of a couple of machines from alternative products into containerboard, and those conversions have had some success in penetrating our product. We really don't compete from a quality perspective with them so much. The new machine addition in the north, together with those conversions, adds about 1.2 million tons of capacity. Containerboard is really a global business, though. As I said earlier, it's 150 million ton market, and we would expect new capacity additions. And we have a strong portfolio of virgin containerboard products that are consumed all over the world. We sell into all of the channels of the marketplace. And so clearly, there has been an increase in capacity, but we have been very successful at competing and winning in the marketplace. Now as we think about the -- to your question about the 2 machines that we've said taken down, our mills are running very well right now and in a marketplace that's relatively stable and slightly up. Steve's indicated that we have no maintenance -- major maintenance downtime planned for Q4 and as you've seen us behaving historically, we match our supply with our customer demand. And so you'll continue see us managing our business in that fashion. So I think it's quite logical.", "Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Thanks, Jim. And just one, Steve, on Tacoma. So I know you talked about expecting synergies of about $10 million to $15 million annually. Obviously, the acquisition was $0.10 accretive in the quarter and you only had half a quarter of that business. So can you give us any sense of how accretive you expect that acquisition to be on an annualized basis in light of the synergies that you talked about earlier?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "We're very happy with the performance and the -- really, the first 1.5 months of operations. I'd hope we'd be able to continue that rate. I think that their production is very strong. They had no significant downtime. And so hopefully, we'll be able to sustain that, but I don't have a specific number to put out about how accretive it would be.", "Operator", "The next question is from Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank.", "Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "You guys addressed your inventory levels earlier on the call, and other producers have suggested that transport issues are leading them to keep inventories higher. I know you said legacy Smurfit levels needed to be higher. But I would assume that some consolidation of the box plants could lead to lower inventories. So I would just like to get your thoughts on this. And then also if you think the current inventory levels are actually the new normal.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I think for us, the 4.5 weeks, we're comfortable with that in the near term. I think over the -- we have been affected by transportation. I think our system is, I'd say, large system. We operate 12 containerboard mills. I think that's the number, because that's kind of -- 13. Jim's telling me it's 13. Of 90 box plants, we have 50 or so domestic customers. We have export customers. And we are, like I think many companies, looking at our supply chain and our network and trying to optimize that. Whether that ends up with higher or lower inventories, it's difficult to figure out for me exactly whether you'd end up higher or lower. The cost of inventory at today's interest rates is relatively small. And so if you can strategically place inventory in a place where it allows you to better serve your customers, you would do that. At the same time, inventory is a use of cash that you'd prefer not to have, unless it was absolutely necessary.", "Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And I guess my follow-up is the $9 million spare parts benefit in the Corrugated Packaging, is that something that you had allowed for in the guidance that you gave in June?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "No.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Steve, I wonder if you can comment just on the MLP line of questioning, if you can comment on how long you've had to look into that question and give us a sense of how long do you think it may take RockTenn to really figure out whether or not such a structure would be appropriate and sort of -- any preliminary obstacles that you see as you've started to look at such a structure for -- that may prevent the company from moving in that direction?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "No. We've had a couple of months to look at it, and it's just -- it's a very complex project. You have to look at it from -- multiple vantage points, may underestimate the number of vantage points you have to look at it. And I think it's potentially attractive enough to where we're going to spend the time looking at how we'd come out. I can't really predict how long it would take. I think the IRS would want to get a private letter ruling if we were to proceed in that direction and there's really not much more I can say or I think would be helpful to say.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Understand, Steve. Yes, and I appreciate you taking a shot at answering it. And then just on the SBS side, can you talk about why the backlogs are strong as they are? Because as I think about the end market exposures, they're not that different relative to some of the other paper packaging grades, like containerboard where it seems like the net profile is softer. So kind of what's so different around what's happening in the SBS market that it appears so much tighter than some of the other paper-based packaging markets?", "James B. Porter", "I think you're right. We -- this is Jim Porter. I think you're right. We are seeing a tightening condition in those grades and industry backlogs, our backlogs are up in the 6-, 7-week range. And so it's really a positive segment right now. I think there's been some conversion from traditional styrofoam products into paper-based products. And I think as the sustainability awareness of the global consumer continues to get traction, we'll continue to see that kind of migration. So that's just one dimension. I think we're also moving into a seasonally stronger period. And so it's a time when things are quite tight, and we're pleased with our execution in that business.", "Operator", "The next question is from Al Kabili with Macquarie.", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "I wanted -- the first question is on the Hopewell, how that's performing post the outage, and are you getting the increased productivity and output that you are expecting from that?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Jim?", "James B. Porter", "This is Jim Porter. We're really very excited with how the Hopewell project unfolded. A big project, a complex project, but I think our team did an outstanding job of executing all aspects of it. We're seeing significant improvements in quality. Our customers are giving us very positive feedback. We're able to make some lighter grades than we were historically. The machines are running faster and more productively. And so really, on all fronts, we're quite pleased with the performance of that project, and we will achieve the stated objectives, as we've communicated publicly.", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "And the follow-on is with this productivity and increased output and the market still, from a demand perspective, pretty flattish in terms of box demand. Any implications as you see the manufacturing footprint and any opportunities there for consolidation, et cetera?", "James B. Porter", "This is Jim Porter again. So you've seen us consistently behave in a way in which we are very much in touch with our large portfolio of international containerboard customers, both internally and externally. And we will always match our mill supply to meet that demand as it grows and as it flexes. So the -- as our assets change and get better, we will constantly make decisions relative to where we make our products to satisfy our customers.", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And currently, I mean, do you see a market -- an increased market for that output via export, et cetera? Or how are you kind of thinking about things right now with current trends?", "James B. Porter", "I think we, as I said earlier, are very focused on meeting emerging demand conditions, and we really won't try to forecast those, we all read the same things relative to the North American domestic economies. And a little bit of good news today, from my standpoint, is we saw a 4% GDP announcement. Globally, there's some improvements that we're seeing. And so as I said earlier, we will always operate our facilities in a way that tries to capture the value of the demand across the world.", "Operator", "The next question is from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.", "Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Most of my questions have been answered. Just a few kind of follow-ups, if you will. But one, I want to kind of drill a little bit into some of what you said regarding your box shipments. It sounded like your box shipments will continue to lag a little bit. I think you said, help me fill this in, but 2% to 3% maybe below industry for the next few quarters. I guess, my question is, is that the right numbers you gave, first? And then second, how much of this -- you talked a little bit about mix and related to some of the food, pizza, et cetera components. But how much of this is related to the heavy upgrades that you're doing and you've talked about those, bringing in the new EVOLs equipment and such. Is it some of it related to that? Is it some of it related just to mix? And if so, after you get past this next couple of quarters, can you kind of resume that market rate? Or can you recapture some of that? Any color there would be helpful, please.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Okay. So just -- I put out the 2% to 3% relative to our volumes versus last year. I don't have an underlying assumption for the industry. That's just what we're seeing now in our particular business. I'm not sure I would continue that for the next few quarters. We're -- so just the guidance we're giving was looking at 1 quarter out, we would see our volumes down 2% to 3% over the prior year. I think you\u2019re -- the installation of the new capital equipment is a -- I'd look at as being a volume-accreting investment. But the decline we're experiencing now is, I'd say, it's the cumulative effect of a series of actions we've taken on the plant closure side and the commercial side, I think, to get our business to where, I think, it ought to be. So I would see us transitioning to, call it flat or hopefully a volume-accreting performance, relative to where we are now. Of course, that's going to be based on our execution and how we perform in the marketplace.", "Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just a follow-up to an earlier question regarding Tacoma. If it did do $0.10 for the quarter -- for half the quarter, that's at a run rate of $0.80 on a full year basis. What's -- maybe there was no downtime in that number, so maybe it's $0.70, $0.75. Is there anything unusual with -- that you captured a bunch of synergies right away or early that makes that not the right run rate as something as -- on an annual basis, call it, $0.75 $0.80, something like that?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I don't think there's anything unusual on an operating basis, but it did perform exceptionally well. I think it's a characteristic of our business, when you have heavy manufacturing equipment performing well -- is appreciate it while you have it because things can't go much better than that and things can -- and just the unexpected can happen. But we're very pleased with the acquisition. We've incorporated our expectations into our guidance for the quarter, and I'd just repeat, couldn't be happier with the acquisitions and certainly the results we've had.", "Operator", "The next question is from Philip Ng with Jefferies.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Based on your outlook on demand for containerboard, can you help us get a better feel for how much more downtime you're expecting to take at those 2 machines that you've taken offline in July?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "No. We can't comment on our operations going forward.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay, that's fine. And then you flagged Fusion. One of your competitors is shutting down some capacity in the CRB side. Is that an opportunity for you to pick up some new business, because I think you have some overlapping capacity in that region?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Yes, it does.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Is it going to be pretty meaningful like a 1% lift on demand? Or...", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I don't want to speculate on what it would be. I mean, we do have the opportunity from the customers that were formerly served by that mill.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Got you. And just one question on the pension comment that I think, Ward, you made on some of the rulings that might be changing on pension smoothing. Can you help us understand what the impact could be for pension contribution over the next few years?", "Ward H. Dickson", "Yes. So if you look over the course of the next 3 years, our cash contributions were projected to be about -- average about $200 million a year. What we were hopeful with, with the House version of the bill, is that there could be a potential reduction of $75 million to $100 million in those contributions over the next 2 years. But it appears that in the Senate version of the bill that occurred last night that, that provision was removed. So it's just very uncertain at this point in time.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Those $200 million a good number? Or would be $200 million-plus something incremental on top of that?", "Ward H. Dickson", "No, $200 million is the number with the facts that we have today.", "Operator", "The next question is from Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets.", "Mark Wilde", "Steve, I have a couple of questions. One, you talked about a preference in terms of using cash to grow the business rather than repurchase stock. I wondered if you could just set some parameters around how you would prefer to grow the business, whether it's kind of filling in, in existing businesses domestically or growing offshore. Just some general guidelines. And then I have a follow-on.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I think all of our businesses have opportunities. I think in corrugated, we have the opportunities to grow domestically. I'd probably put a little bit higher priority if there were an opportunity that would support our export business. Our export business, we're establishing very good customer relationships, so I think there would be a natural growth in that area. In our consumer businesses, which I would put packaging opportunities there, I think we have the potential to expand product lines in that business and I think I would include the display business as part of that. We've been very happy with the NPG acquisition, and it has given us, I think, the opportunity to deepen our customer relationships. So those -- I think if you look at -- a question we'll get is fill in versus larger transactions and I think we're -- I tend to just look at what the opportunity for what it is, is rather than the size or particular attributes of it. And I think we have a platform to where we have potentially a lot of different opportunities. And I think we can naturally grow our business along the packaging and paper lines and be very successful. My feeling is that those opportunities are going to be tangible enough to where we'll be able to, I think, grow our business within the balance sheet that we have. And if we can't, I'm not so focused on that, that I'm not going to take advantage -- trying to just take advantage of an opportunity just to do it. It has to make economic sense. It has to make us a better business. And I don't know -- I want to communicate we're going to have proper leverage on the basis on -- proper leverage on the business, and we'll use stock repurchases to maintain a proper leverage on the business.", "Mark Wilde", "Okay. The other question I had, Steve, is just if you look at the 2 other large public competitors who've already reported this quarter, their margins are about 500 basis points above yours in the containerboard and corrugated business. And I just like to get your thoughts on how much you think you can kind of shrink that gap over time.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "That's a hard one to answer. I think we have significant opportunities to perform -- to improve the performance of the corrugated business. And I don't want to speculate on what our competitors are doing or how to fill the gap. I just want to get the most out of the business that we have. And I think we can improve the results that we have in the business, and I think we are improving the results.", "Mark Wilde", "Is there any reason to think that, that 500 basis point gap should continue, should persist over time?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "That's difficult for me to respond to because I don't have insight into their operations, I only have insight into our operations.", "Operator", "The next question is from Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "I just want to talk about the landscape of mills that are available because I'd be surprised, frankly, if you're evaluating any additional containerboard facilities. But can you discuss what might still be out there in terms of stand-alone mills? And is there half dozen or a dozen?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I don't want to speculate on specific mills or how many that would be out there. I will say from an opportunity standpoint, there seem to be opportunities out there. And I think I'd look at -- I expect we'll have opportunities to look at. Whether they make sense for us or not, I can't really conclude.", "Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "What I mean was it looks like Tacoma was a great acquisition for you, but I can't imagine that's the only asset that you looked at. So, well, let's assume for a moment that you're getting close to your optimal containerboard mill structure. Where are we likely to see growth from RockTenn going forward? You generated a lot of shareholder value by growing this company over the last 6 or 8 years. And if it's not containerboard, would it be bleached board or what's next?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "We're going to continue to look at a series of opportunities that fit with our business. So we're going to look at display opportunities. We'll look at opportunities on the paper and packaging side. And I think we'll grow naturally with the opportunity set, which is out there. We have -- continue to have very good opportunities to invest in our own business and we're going to continue to do that. And then to the extent we can accelerate growth through acquisition, we'll do that as well. I'll repeat, if we can't do that, I think we can grow shareholder value very nicely by buying back shares.", "Operator", "The next question is from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Steve, as we look at the displays business, that continues to show tremendous growth. And could you just talk a little bit about whether there's still some runway left organically? Have we peaked in terms of what the system that you have now can do in terms of its volumes? And if that's the case, would you -- are there still acquisition opportunities in that business that you could do to help you grow it, if you hit a wall organically?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "That's a great question. I'm glad you asked it. Our display business, we acquired it, I think, in 1994, before 1995, and it's $40 million in sales. And we grew it to $350 million in 2011, primarily organically. We made a couple of acquisitions, but they really weren't that significant. We did that organically, and we did it by focusing on the needs of primarily consumer products companies that are looking at promoting their product. And we've looked at the business as a merchandising business as compared to an outlet for us to sell our paperboard or corrugated. And we've been -- I think we've been very successful. We have -- we execute extremely well. The programs are exceptionally complex. And then with the Smurfit acquisition, we took, I guess, Adams in West Chester and Chicago, we have a display facility in Chicago, a corrugated box facility, and we moved them over into the display business and they've been very nice facilities for us to serve our consumer products companies' display needs. And that's taken us to a run rate of, I think, of -- it is about $800 million. As compared to some of our business, other businesses, which I think are somewhat constrained by the size of the manufacturing business, this business is not as constrained and is -- probably, its ability to grow is a function of the -- both the manufacturing facilities, but also the creativeness and innovation that we have in the display business. I think there are acquisitions, and I think we have a runway to grow. So I would not characterize us as having peaked out at that level. I would be hopeful that we'll be able to grow -- continue to grow the display business as we've done in the past.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "And -- which is a great rundown of how that's -- I appreciate that. Just in a very rough sense, what would you say your share is? I mean, obviously, it was 0 when you started in 1994. And I know the market has grown quite a bit. But are you like 1/4 of the market, 1/3 or smaller?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "That's a tough one because there's an organization called POPAI, which the last I looked, the total business was a $15 billion to $20 billion business. And there's so many different product categories. I really can't estimate the share that we have in the business.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Mark Connelly with CLSA.", "We'll move on to the next question. The next question is from George Staphos with Bank of America.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "My last question, guys. Certainly, the productivity gains that you're getting with the EVOL machines have been impressive. Could you comment at all, though, whether the continued introduction of the EVOLs might change the type of customer that you might need to take within the corrugated market? In other words, does it tend to bias you towards larger volume, larger-run customers? Or is that really not a consideration at all? It just makes you more effective no matter the customer base.", "Michael E. Kiepura", "Thanks, George. George, the EVOL is really a quite flexible piece of equipment. It certainly makes us more efficient on long-running business. But also some of the other -- the make-ready features and other aspects has made us much more effective with shorter run and smaller boxes as well. So typically, it has been replacing 2 and sometimes 3 other machines in our plants, so it's certainly is -- drives better cost profile, better quality. But it has a lot of flexibility, so it's not just geared to volume. It's really making our plants more flexible and nimble in being able to serve a broader range of customers.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Mike, I know this is a tough question to answer and it's looking back with a benefit of hindsight, which is never fair. But if we look back to the mid-2000s, obviously, Smurfit went through a very large recapitalization program that they initially focused really on their box plants. And there's still opportunities for RockTenn now as the owner of these assets to improve productivity. That's, I guess, ultimately a good news story because you have a further runway on this. But one could question, given the capitalization program that had been done, why are there still so many opportunities left to go?", "Michael E. Kiepura", "George, going back to the mid-2000s and a much bigger footprint of box plants, many more opportunities to invest and improve probably than there was capital to go around. I started my career over 30 years ago in the Smurfit organization. And recognizing how they allocated capital, they were always tight on capital. So I think with the numerous acquisitions they did in the '90s and in the early 2000s and the debt that they took on, I don't think there was amount of capital available to go to all the hungry mouths, so to speak, to feed. So I think at one point, they had over 150 box plants, and that takes a lot of capital in a capital-intensive business. So we brought the number of plants down. And we're investing back into those businesses, I think, at a rate to really develop a strong network of plants from a quality and ability to serve both the local, regional and national box markets.", "Operator", "The next question is from Max Salk with PPM America.", "Max Salk", "A quick question on the Fusion mill closure and what impact you see that having to CRB utilization rates, and if there's anything to draw from pricing there.", "James B. Porter", "This is Jim Porter. I think we're all aware that Fusion is about 6% of the market at about, what, 146,000 tons, and we have capacity within that region. And so -- and there will be an impact, but we in no way would want to comment on price. We see opportunities with customers in that region, and we will operate our business in a way that hopefully we can earn some of that.", "Operator", "Our final question today is from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.", "Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just a couple quick follow-ups. First, on working capital. What are your thoughts for the balance of this year? And from where you sit today, I know you've taken -- you said some inventory is up to levels you're comfortable at. But if we remain relatively static on the volume front, your thoughts next year as well.", "Ward H. Dickson", "Well, I'd talk about the third quarter working capital performance. In the quarter, it was actually better than the guidance that we gave. We said it was going to be a use of about $20 million in cash in the quarter, and it was significantly smaller than that. As we move into Q4, we actually think it's going to be a source. So we should have a reduction in working capital moving from Q3 to Q4. Although we talked about the inventory levels, we will also -- I think we'll have an increase in our days payable outstanding as we move into the fourth quarter. We're at around 44 days, between 44 and 45 days on a net working capital basis, and I think we're comfortable with that as we move into the fourth quarter.", "Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then one other kind of related question to a different topic. But the discussion around $10 a ton price decrease in medium, any -- it seemingly has not had any impact on anyone. But have you noticed any differences in your selling prices in those 2 regions relating to what was at Publisher's? Or is this something really that goes back to 6, 8 months ago as just sort of a book adjustment?", "James B. Porter", "We can't really comment on what was published in PPW. It's an index. But we have no comment on that topic. Our business is solid. We continue to see strong demand for our corrugated medium products, and we feel the market is strong for our customer base going forward.", "Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And then last somewhat related topic. The 2, I think Seminole and, something in my notes, West Point, where you had taken down the 2 machines, I think you said about 180,000 tons a year or directionally in that range, 15 a month. The thought process regarding just doing it as an indefinite idle or versus a permanent close, how do you balance that? And what would be the triggers that would make you go back and revisit, making it permanent?", "James B. Porter", "This is Jim Porter. I think as I shared earlier, we always are focused on our production capability versus our customer demand. And we sell our products into 3 channels: our domestic customers, our internal box plants and our international customers. And it's a big system, and we will always try to ensure that we've got the right production capability to meet customer needs. So it's an ongoing never-ending process of running our business day to day.", "Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just last clean-up question with regarding repurchase. Is there anything that prohibits you from being in the market today, repurchasing?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I think there's a couple day window after the press release, and it's ongoing beyond that. We really can't answer the question about whether we're prohibited or not.", "Operator", "I have no further questions.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Okay, perfect.

Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MeadWestvaco Corporation Second Quarter Results Conference Call.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Jason Thompson, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Jason Thompson", "Thanks, Connie. And good morning, everyone. John Luke, Bob Beckler, Mark Rajkowski are here to review our second quarter results. And we also have Bob Feeser here for Q&A as well.", "Notification for this call was broadly disclosed and is being webcast at mwv.com, where slides are also available. Our results and commentary are presented on a continuing operations basis and are correct as of today but could include time-sensitive information that is subject to change. In addition, any statements that are forward-looking are subject to known and unknown risks and are not guarantees of future performance.", "I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Luke.", "John A. Luke", "Jason, thanks very much. And good morning, everyone.", "We continued to make solid progress in the second quarter, generating profitable growth despite what continued to be challenging global economic conditions. Our results demonstrate that our strategy is working. We want all of our shareholders to understand our financial performance in a detailed level, as well as the strategy that's behind our progress, and we'll cover this as best as we can before turning to your questions.", "We have positioned MWV to outperform through participation in attractive end markets, supported by commercial and innovation capabilities that improve our overall mix and generate profitable revenue growth. At the same time, we're improving the efficiency of our operations and eliminating unnecessary costs. As a result of this continuing work to build and execute a differentiated strategy, we have delivered solid performance improvement in the first half of this year. And we're confident that we'll continue to make more progress in the quarters ahead.", "Our efforts are directly reflected in the 6% sales growth across the company in the second quarter, including revenue growth in our core packaging businesses that exceeded both global GDP and broader industry growth rates in many of our packaging markets. As we noted last quarter, we're intensely focused on ensuring that our top line growth is much more fully reflected in our bottom line performance through operational excellence and overhead cost reductions. The work we've done in these areas over the past year has put us on track to deliver more than $100 million of permanent annual savings and achieve market-leading margins in 2015. We nearly doubled earnings per share in the second quarter compared to last year, and we increased adjusted EBITDA by almost 30%. Through the first half of this year, we have increased our adjusted EBITDA to $448 million.", "Looking at our performance in the second quarter. There are several developments that punctuate our progress, and they include significant gains in EBITDA and EBITDA margins in Food & Beverage and Home, Health & Beauty compared to last year; pricing and operating productivity improvement in Brazil; record quarterly performance in Specialty Chemicals; and a strong contribution from our major capital investments and cost-reduction programs. I'll comment briefly on each of these.", "First, our significant gains in EBITDA and EBITDA margins. Bob Beckler will go into more detail on the drivers of our performance in each segment, but it's clear that our market participation strategies are working. We're better leveraging increased sales of our differentiated packaging solutions with strong operational performance.", "Second, in Brazil, we're producing more paperboard following our mill investments, and we've been successful at price increases in our corrugated markets despite the very tough economic conditions and continued uncertain outlook for the rest of the year in Brazil.", "Third, in Specialty Chemicals, we continue to demonstrate there is even more headroom for profitable revenue growth in this business both now and in the future. We expect to operate this business in a manner that increases the intrinsic value for all of our shareholders.", "And finally, solid contributions from our major capital investments and cost-reduction programs. These initiatives have always been part of our aim toward industry-leading margins, and we're seeing the positive impact on our quarterly performance. We saved $21 million in the second quarter and remain on track to achieve our goal of $75 million in savings for this year, with a run rate of $100 million or more.", "As I noted at the outset, we're very focused on generating profitable growth and improving our financial performance despite the current soft global economic conditions. Overall, customer sentiment and consumer spending, market demand have been marked by slow recoveries in Europe and the U.S. and uncertainty in many emerging markets, notably Brazil and India. We remain very positive about the longer-term outlook for these markets and are in particular very encouraged by the uptick in FDI in India in the wake of the recently concluded national elections. The growing middle classes in India, Brazil and other developing economies represent a powerful economic force, which we are especially well positioned to capitalize on.", "Our recent performance gives us confidence that we have the ability to continue on the vector we've established toward industry-leading growth and profitability. We'll work to build on our momentum from the first half of the year, as there's much more ground to cover. Everyone at MWV is aligned and determined to achieve our goals, and we're confident that the strategies we have in place will lead to earnings and cash flow growth this year and market-leading profitability in 2015.", "I'll now turn the call over to Bob Beckler for additional commentary about our performance and outlook in each segment before Mark Rajkowski talks about the second quarter financials. Bob?", "Robert A. Feeser", "Thank you, John.", "The story in each of our segments during the second quarter was about execution of our commercial and operational strategies. On the whole, we were very successful, and our performance demonstrates how our growth and productivity investments continue to accelerate progress toward our goal of industry-leading profitability. I would now like to step through each of the segments with some brief highlights for the second quarter, as well as our outlook for further improvement in the third quarter.", "In Food & Beverage, sales and earnings increased significantly. It was a very good quarter for this business compared to last year. Sales increased 5.5% in Q2. And EBITDA margin improved to better than 17%, an increase of over 400 basis points. The sales and margin growth was achieved broadly across the segment's markets with profitable market share gains, pricing and mix improvements relative to last year. Shipments were especially strong for our bleached, SBS paperboard grades for premium food packaging, food service applications such as cups and plates and tobacco packaging. Beverage packaging based on our unbleached CNK also grew with many of our key global and regional brand owners. Machinery placements achieved over the last few years continue to pull through solid volume growth for beverage cartons, especially in Asia Pacific. Even in North America, where consumer demand for soft drinks and beer has been more challenging, we have picked up some share by choosing the right partners and diversifying our customer base. As such, we have good momentum heading into the second half.", "Our manufacturing operations ran well in the second quarter, and we maintained solid backlogs for both bleached and unbleached coated paperboard. Wood costs, wood availability and rising logistics costs remain challenges, as we noted in the previous quarter, and I'll come back to that point in just a moment.", "In the third quarter, we expect Food & Beverage segment profit to be above last year's levels. Our order backlogs are expected to remain strong for most of our markets, especially so for bleached board. CNK demand is expected to hold steady, with strength in global beverage helping offset some weakness we are seeing in frozen food demand. We expect continued good operating performance in our mills, but as noted, wood and logistics inflation are higher than expected as we move into the second half. Given ongoing strong SBS demand and the need to offset these costs, we have announced a price increase for bleached board for the upcoming quarter.", "In Home, Health & Beauty, sales and earnings were again up strongly, and our EBITDA margin improved more than 400 basis points to 16.3%. This business has good momentum on the commercial side, with volume and pricing gains, and is operating well with an improved cost structure. Sales were up double digits for our dispensing solutions, especially fragrance pumps and hose-end sprayers for lawn and garden care. We also completed our transition to Shellpak Renew, a paperboard-based version of our popular adherence packaging solution for health care, and turned to positive profit in that line of business despite the transition costs. Initial impact from recently announced price increases across the Home, Health & Beauty business also contributed $2 million of improvement during the quarter, and the full benefit will carry forward during the second half of the year.", "In the third quarter, we expect Home, Health & Beauty earnings again to be higher than last year, though slightly below the second quarter level. This is a seasonally slower period for the segment following the springtime peak of the home and garden season and accounting for holidays in Europe. However, we still expect higher productivity from our operations and continued commercial gains in the third quarter.", "In industrial packaging, results were mixed this past quarter, with sales up but earnings down versus prior year, largely impacted by weak economic conditions in Brazil. The earnings comparison was also negatively affected by FX impact, a significant flood event in the region of our Tres Barras mill and several onetime benefits that occurred in Q2 of 2013. Excluding these items, totaling $5 million, earnings increased modestly versus prior year.", "This year, we have seen the economy in Brazil continue to soften, with GDP now forecasted to fall below 1% growth for the year. In particular, markets slowed sharply in June as Brazil consumers and manufacturers reduced activity during the World Cup soccer tournament. Things are expected to bounce back from this very low level, but it will still be against a relatively weak backdrop. Despite the present challenges, we continue to execute well on our Brazil strategy and on the controllables. In the corrugated packaging side of the business, while volume was unfavorable, we moved effectively to offset inflation with pricing actions in the second quarter, the full effect of which we will see in the third quarter. And in Tres Barras, the expanded kraftliner and medium-board mill continues to make good progress. Several factors led to higher operating costs in the quarter, including the flood previously noted as well as some aggressive trial work in the mill focused on further product and process improvements. Commercially, we were achieving excellent results with our new high-perform linerboard. This new range of kraftliners is exceptional in quality and gaining share in South America and other global markets. This success gives us the flexibility to run our mill operations to produce as much as possible and balance demand in the paperboard market with internal demand for our corrugated business.", "In India, where we are the highest-quality material supplier to the corrugated market, we are winning new business from our brand owners, who have specified products based on performance and our ability to deliver lower total cost of ownership. Sales in India increased by 12% in the quarter. This is still a developing market but one where we see good potential from the growing middle class and the recent shift toward pro-growth national economic policies. We are still optimizing the India investment, including a new paper machine in Morai, and as such, the business recorded a slight loss in the second quarter.", "Our overall outlook for the industrial packaging segment in the third quarter is for modestly higher profits compared to last year. Specifically in Brazil, we still envision being above 25% EBITDA margin by year end leveraging our expanded world-class mill assets. Despite the current economic uncertainty in Brazil, we remain confident in the foundation and the flexibility to maximize value in paperboard and corrugated packaging as economic conditions and consumer demand drive expected growth over time.", "And finally, our Specialty Chemicals business continues to operate very well and perform strongly and consistently in its key markets, reaching new records for sales and earnings during the second quarter while increasing EBITDA margin to 27%. We are achieving growth broadly in asphalt, oilfield and activated carbon by gaining share and improving mix with innovative product formulations. We see significant upside in each of these specialty markets and the opportunity to drive additional profitable growth over time. In activated carbon, for example, the business continues to grow in the global automotive sector by offering technologies to control evaporative fuel emissions.", "In the third quarter, we expect segment profitability in Specialty Chemicals to reach a similar level as reported last year, a quarter that benefited from $8 million of onetime legal and insurance settlements. We will also have a heavier outage schedule in this business during the third quarter compared to last year.", "So overall, our segments are performing well and continuing to make steady progress toward our goal of industry-leading margins for each business. Though total economic activity has remained weak globally, our differentiated strategy has enabled us to outperform on a relative basis and will provide additional opportunities for profitable growth. We are taking advantage of those commercial opportunities and leveraging our success with improved operations to deliver profitability that will ultimately be in line with our closest peers and competitors.", "And with that, I will turn the call over to Mark to discuss our financial results. Mark?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Thanks, Bob.", "We continued to improve our financial performance and underlying business model this quarter with solid commercial and operational execution across our businesses as well as continued bottom line benefits from our major capital investments and cost-reduction activities. The result was significant year-over-year EBITDA and EBITDA margin improvement. We're confident that these efforts will continue to drive strong year-over-year performance improvement over the second half of this year and, ultimately, industry-leading profitability for each of our businesses.", "We have a lot of momentum and expect to continue to deliver earnings growth in the third quarter despite some challenging economic headwinds in certain markets and rising fiber costs. A few of the highlights of our improved execution in the second quarter include increasing revenue by 6% through volume and price/mix improvement across each of our segments; substantial improvement in our operating margins on an adjusted basis, almost 400 basis points; in addition to our commercial and operational success, we delivered on our growth and productivity investments and on our cost-savings program. We also improved free cash flow, excluding items, to $37 million in the quarter from higher earnings and lower capital spending. I'll provide some details on the key drivers of our second quarter earnings improvement then discuss our overall outlook.", "Our strong financial performance started with 6% sales growth driven by execution of our commercial strategies, reflecting the positive momentum we began to build during the first quarter of this year. As you see in the slides, the year-over-year volume and price/mix contributions were significant at 4 and 3 percentage points, respectively. These benefits were partially offset by currency and business dispositions completed in the quarter, principally the European beauty and personal care folding carton business.", "We had notable top line growth in the Food & Beverage segment from gains we're making with our higher-value paperboard solutions and solid volume growth in the Home, Health & Beauty segment from continued commercial gains with our differentiated plastic pumps and dispensers. Drivers of revenue growth in the Industrial segment included higher pricing to offset inflation in Brazil, as well as higher paper sales in Brazil and India, partially offset by weaker underlying demand for corrugated boxes in Brazil. And the Specialty Chemicals business continues to make gains in targeted high-value pine chemical and activated carbon markets.", "Our second quarter 2014 adjusted enterprise EBITDA increased 26% to $257 million or 17.5% of sales, which is a 280 basis point improvement compared to the year-ago quarter. We generated outstanding leverage in the quarter from our intensified focus on operational excellence. We also saw contributions from our productivity investments and cost-savings program, which together added almost $40 million to adjusted EBITDA during the quarter on a net basis. Our adjusted gross margin in the quarter improved almost 400 basis points to 21.7%.", "Adjusted SG&A declined 30 basis points year-over-year to 10.6% of sales. Benefits from our cost-savings program in the quarter were $21 million, including a 20% reduction in corporate department costs, resulting in year-to-date savings of $30 million. Our SG&A cost savings in the quarter were offset by a $20 million year-over-year change in compensation-related accruals. The change is largely due to the reversal of incentive reserves last year related to the operational challenges that we had, where we reduced management's compensation based on performance. We'll realize additional cost savings in the back half of the year, and we remain on track to achieve our 2014 goal of at least $75 million in savings.", "In addition to continuing to reduce our overhead cost structure and progressing towards industry-leading margins, we're also evaluating a new methodology of allocating corporate costs to enable us to manage and report our segment financial results consistent with our peers. We plan to complete this work in the fourth quarter, at which point we'll finalize our approach and timing of recasting our segment reporting.", "Quickly turning to cash. Cash flow from continuing operations in the second quarter was $151 million versus $167 million last year. While net income was higher, working capital levels grew primarily due to higher receivables from a strong commercial performance late in the quarter. As we move through the back half of the year, we expect cash flow from operations to continue to improve on a sequential basis from both stronger earnings and lower working capital levels. Normalized free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow after CapEx, dividends and excluding cash restructuring, was $37 million.", "Our CapEx was lower compared to a relatively higher investment period last year. CapEx year-to-date is down almost $100 million, and our full year 2014 outlook remains around $350 million.", "Now turning to the outlook. As we look ahead to the third quarter and second half of the year, we will continue to execute well on the controllables, including volume growth and price/mix gains from our commercial strategies; strong operational productivity across our mills, plants and other facilities; and substantial cost savings in line with our plans. We expect these elements will continue to drive strong earnings growth in the second half of the year.", "We're also working to address several external factors that may impact the magnitude of our expected third quarter and second half performance. As John noted, the economic outlook in some of our markets remains uneven, particularly in Brazil where economic conditions are significantly weaker than we and others expected. Despite a weaker economic climate, higher-than-expected fiber costs and a $30 million adverse impact from weather in the first half of the year, we still expect to deliver between $1 billion and $1,025,000,000 of adjusted full year EBITDA, which represents year-over-year improvement of at least 25% and puts us squarely on a trajectory of industry-leading margins by 2015.", "John, back to you.", "John A. Luke", "Mark, thanks very much.", "Let me conclude our formal remarks by saying that the path to industry-leading margins is a clear one for us. We have to continue to execute on our commercial and operational strategies, increasing revenue through differentiated participation in growing markets and delivering benefits from our major investments and cost-reduction actions. We've done well through the first half of the year, and we expect to continue that momentum in the quarters ahead with the goal to significantly increase earnings and cash flow this year and achieve the industry-leading profitability that we and our shareholders expect.", "We'll now turn to you for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We have our first question from George Staphos.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I'll ask a couple 3 and then turn it over. The recasting of the financials with the reallocation of the corporate expense, if you had completed with your analysis in the third quarter, would it be fair that you'd be in a position to do the recasting by the fourth quarter? Or would be -- or would 2015 be a more realistic target? And then secondly, when we talk about achieving industry-leading margins across your segments, could you remind us about how you're going to, if you will, put your segments on a comparable basis relative to peers, and what adjustments we should make? And are you there for the whole of 2015, or are you hoping to get there at some point during 2015?", "John A. Luke", "George, let me begin, and I'll turn it right over to Mark to get to the specifics of the -- of your question. Clearly, we're committed to moving forward with the reallocation as rapidly as we can. And if we're ready sooner, we'll get out sooner. And obviously, we'll look to present that in a manner that is readily comparable from your standpoint. We would clearly look to drive those industry-leading margins as rapidly as we can in 2015. We have the capability to -- in place to drive those and that's what we will look to do, but certainly, we're committed to being there by the end of the year. Mark?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "John, you summarized it pretty well. We expect to be completed with the work in the fourth quarter, George. And then we'll -- at that point in time, we'll decide whether we want to recast then or wait until the first quarter of 2015. And the purpose of this is really to provide more transparency around how we stack up versus our peers and the competition on an apples-to-apples basis.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. So just a clarification and a follow-on: This will be on an allocated basis and it'll adjust also for pension income, so it'll be apples-to-apples as best that you can. Would that be correct? And...", "John A. Luke", "Absolutely, yes. George, yes, we're going to -- it'll be a much fuller allocation of corporate costs and excluding pension income.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And the follow-on, just in Industrial and specifically Brazil. Obviously, you can't control the macroeconomic conditions, but in aggregate, the performance has been disappointing relative to what your expectations would have been back in 2010, 2011. Are there any learnings from the investment that you made there, what you found? And anything that you would have done differently, and what you can do going forward to get the returns and margins up given the context of a tougher environment?", "John A. Luke", "George, thanks very much. And I'll turn this over to Bob Beckler to comment more fully. I think we've learned a tremendous amount, but most importantly, I think the team has done a very, very good job from beginning to end. Our expectations for ramping up performance were record setting in terms of our overall expectations. And we darn near met that. I think we ran into some complexity given the magnitude of the project. That's no excuse, but those are things that applied to our learning and certainly we will carry forward in all that we do. But I think we're most excited as we look forward, economic conditions notwithstanding, about the power of the investment that we've made. Bob?", "Robert K. Beckler", "Yes. And just to add to John's good comments: The fundamentals of the project are still very sound. And we really like our position strategically as the markets evolve. Yes, we didn't draw it up this way in terms of the Brazilian economy and the impact that, that is obviously having on the corrugated sector, but we're executing very well in this environment. We're taking pricing actions to offset inflation despite the tough conditions in the market. We're operating with discipline in terms of where we place our new paperboard across the business. So balancing between the internal demand for our corrugated packaging business with the external demand, which has been quite strong both in Brazil and for export markets. So while a tougher environment perhaps than we or anybody else might have anticipated at this stage, we feel good about how we're executing and the fundamental flexibility and competitive strength that our strategy gives us in Brazil.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly.", "Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "John, since the conference call started, I've gotten 5 different emails from clients asking if you're going to sell Specialty Chemicals, so maybe I could ask the question this way. In the past, you've said that you would be willing to sell that business if you could get enough value to make it fair and cover your tax hit. Presumably, lots of people have talked to you about this business. Has your view on your willingness to sell changed in any way?", "John A. Luke", "Mark, I'm not at all surprised that you've gotten those emails. I would have thought maybe you've gotten a few more...", "Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "The rest of them probably went to you.", "John A. Luke", "I'll check after the call. In all seriousness, we have and continue to actively evaluate all opportunities to create shareholder value. And given the interest and focus in and around Specialty Chemicals, you can be sure that we are continuing to actively evaluate the logic of such a potential. I think everyone knows that we have a very good track record of creating value for our shareholders by disposing of businesses that may not fit our strategy. As we've noted publicly, that amounts to some $4 billion over the -- roughly the past decade that's been returned to shareholders. We believe that there is significant upside value in the chemical business. And any transaction, should it occur, has to contemplate not only the structure but timing that would let us maximize fully the value intrinsic in that business.", "Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "John, one more question more specifically on your Food & Beverage business. Clearly, U.S. soft drink demand is not that great, but your numbers have been pretty good. Can you talk about how much of that is beer, which you did mention? And how much is coming in non-beverage markets like food and nonfood applications?", "John A. Luke", "We'd be happy to. And I will turn to Bob Beckler to comment more fully on that.", "Robert K. Beckler", "Great question. We're very pleased with how we're performing in beverage. The North American dynamics get a lot of the headlines, but in fact, it's a global business for us that is running strong in multiple theaters. So it's about a combination of things. It's the commercial focus that we have in those end markets. We're finding that responsiveness to the markets and changes in the markets is, more than ever, key to success. Our customers are changing over lines faster, looking for more differentiation, and we're responding to those changes with our global capabilities. We're also picking the right spots to participate. We have very good relationships with the large brand owners and are working very closely with them to help them be successful in their very competitive markets. I also mentioned in my prepared remarks the machinery strategy that we have in the business. This is not something new. This is something that has been longstanding in the business. It's an investment every year that we make to provide more flexibility, more capability, greater productivity for our customers; and helps pull through our innovative, high-quality packages for the long term. So it's a combination of things working well for us. The point you made in your question is true, that we're holding steady in the CNK part of our business largely in part, right now, to the great strength that we're seeing on the beverage side, which is helping offset a little bit of weakness that we're seeing in frozen food.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub.", "Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "And maybe just following up a little bit on the comments, John, you were making on the Specialty Chemicals. I think, in the past, you've indicated that half of the equation is finding a way to maximize the value of the Specialty Chemicals, et cetera, but that part of it too was also wanting your packaging business to -- gotten to the point where you want it to get for the timing to be right. First of all, is that a correct assessment? And if it is, the Specialty Chemicals business obviously is doing terrifically. Have you gotten the packaging business or how close are you to getting the packaging business to where you want it to be?", "John A. Luke", "That has been a consideration over time. And obviously, as we evaluate the business, Mark, it is appropriate to consider as well. The most important thing, though, is to ensure that we're creating value for our shareholders overall, and that's what we're looking to do: one, by evaluating, as you said, suggested -- the logic of a chemical business transaction; and secondly, actively working, with our focus on industry-leading margins and the overall participation strategy we have in packaging, to ensure that is right. And we don't see any undue restriction limiting our actions on either side. We feel very bullish about the opportunities that we've got in packaging.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson.", "Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "John, just an obligatory MLP question for you. How serious are you in considering putting your virgin paper mills into an MLP structure, if you could get a private letter ruling, which obviously you can't do today?", "John A. Luke", "Adam, happy for the question and another one that is coming. That is, it's not at all a surprise. Clearly, with the focus on MLPs, we are actively, as you would expect, evaluating to understand the mechanics of such a transaction given what could be a source of great value creation. As others in the industry have commented, we've read and as we've talked to advisers, these are complicated transactions and it would be premature for us to comment one way or another. The message we would like to leave today, though, is that we will actively evaluate the MLP concept and its fit for any portion of our business and then be prepared to come out and comment more fully what we've learned and what direction we would pursue.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "And the other thing I'd add. I think we've got a pretty good track record of always looking at creative ways to maximize shareholder value and we're open to new ideas.", "John A. Luke", "That's right. Complication doesn't -- complicated transactions don't scare us off. You've learned a lot.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Right. That's right.", "Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "And just one on SBS. Obviously, you announced a price increase recently, effective September 1. And none of your competitors has followed as yet. Can you just talk about how healthy you consider that market; and what the import threat, as you see it, is from Europe, Brazil and China, for that matter; and whether this increase, if it's successful, could attract more competition from those markets?", "John A. Luke", "Adam, be happy to, and I'll ask Bob Beckler and/or Bob Feeser to follow as well by adding additional color. First of all, we've announced because in the markets we participate in, we see demand to support that, but equally important is a determination on our part to ensure that we're appropriately covering what has been inflation, most notably on the wood fiber side of the business. Both of those factors are ones that drive our pricing decisions. And to your question about imports, we have not yet, in our -- the markets we serve, been in any way thwarted by import threat. Importantly from our standpoint, it's the logic that we're pursuing it to do the right thing for the business overall. Bob Feeser, comments to second that with?", "Robert A. Feeser", "Yes, yes. Adam, just to build on that. We've had good success with our pricing actions in the first half of the year, pricing up 6% both in SBS and in CNK. And the focus around the price increase, as John mentioned, is to recover the costs that we're seeing in the second half. So we're very much committed to maintaining our important model of covering cost inflation with price. It's still very early, but we fully intend to do everything we can to cover that cost inflation in the second half. And as John mentioned, in terms of import pressure, we're very well positioned with our differentiated substrates in our end markets. While it's always there as a potential, and we monitor it closely, we have not seen any significant impact from import and expect that to be the case going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I just want to check. Mark, you mentioned the EBITDA target and you used $1 billion to $1,025,000,000. Is that correct?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "That's correct.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Can you just remind me? Because I thought, last quarter, we were talking about a slightly higher number in light of the more recent cost-and-improvement program.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, we're executing very well on the controllables, Gail. I mean, you've seen that particularly in through the first half of this year and whether it's gaining share, driving price, a lot of productivity coming out of our mills. We're taking our costs. But I think it's important that we'd be transparent on the factors that are external that are impacting our business. And the economy has not gotten any better. In fact, in Brazil, it's gotten -- it's worsened. It's weakened. We're seeing a lot of pressure on our input cost, particularly around fiber. We're trying to absorb a $30 million impact that we saw through the first half of the year, on weather. And we're doing a good job of clawing back a chunk of that but those are big factors. We're continuing to drive as high as we can and -- but what we feel good about is even at the lowest levels, we're going to be up 25% year-over-year on EBITDA. And we're squarely on track to achieve those industry-leading margins that we expect to in 2015.", "John A. Luke", "Yes. And I think, Mark, you've said it well. Let me just reinforce, Gail, that all of us are very focused on the higher end of that range and we're not going to throw in the towel, by any stretch. We're going to continue to work on the remediation initiatives. Why? Because that's obviously our job but, secondly, because the business model we have in place is more than capable of meeting that level and more. But Mark has, I think, very carefully outlined some of the noncontrollable factors that we're facing and the range adjustment from a transparency standpoint as one we just wanted to get out there.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And just looking at Food & Beverage a little bit. Were there any -- and I apologize if you've cited [ph] and I just missed it. Were there any kind of one-off-sy operating issues? Because if I think about and looked back last year, you had a big issue at Covington with an outage, plus you've got the benefits of the boiler and pricing. And it just seems like profitability isn't seeing as much of a boost given the swing factors. Was there kind of any one-offs that might go away over the next couple of quarters?", "John A. Luke", "Gail, thanks. Let me ask Bob Feeser to comment on that.", "Robert A. Feeser", "Yes. Gail, really no onetime operational impacts in the quarter. In fact, all of our mills ran extremely well, most of them running above planned production levels for the quarter. So we feel very good about how the mills are positioned for operating going into the second half as well. The third quarter, while we do have some outages in the mills that are normally planned across the mills, it should be again a very strong operating quarter in the third quarter.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And finally, just a couple of questions on Brazil. I guess it's early days, only a couple weeks, but have you seen any sense of change since the end of the World Cup? And can you just give us some sort of sense of the internal consumption versus the external consumption in terms of board? How much are you selling on the market relative to what you're consuming at this point?", "John A. Luke", "Bob Beckler is freshly back from Brazil and poised to respond to those questions.", "Robert K. Beckler", "Well, it's certainly interesting times in Brazil. We've not seen anything like the month of June, I would say, in the last 5 years, where major customers across the country took both federal -- extra federal holidays but also, in some cases, forced vacations of as much as half of the month in order to respond to the slowing consumer demand that occurred over the Cup. Our customers are telling us, though, that they are beginning to see the rebound from that. July will not be a full rebound because, of course, the Cup stretched over that period. But as we get into August, our customers believe that they'll be back certainly to the pre-Cup levels of performance. Plus, the second half of the year tends to be seasonally better for the corrugated industry on the whole, and we're beginning to see that already in July.", "Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And board sales, internal, external?", "Robert K. Beckler", "Right. We don't exactly break out the split between internal and external, for market reasons, but I can say that we've really had good success with the growth of the paperboard business. We've grown 20% in total paperboard volume in the market over the last year. And we've also positioned ourselves with 20% market share in Brazil. So very good commercial progress on the paperboard side. That's given us, as we said before, tremendous flexibility to balance across the system and maximize value of the total business.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just a couple of questions. Would you be able to elaborate more on what is driving the wood fiber inflation?", "John A. Luke", "Bob Feeser, you're poised to cover that. I think there are a variety of factors, but you might hit a couple of the principal ones.", "Robert A. Feeser", "Yes. Alex, really a couple of things. Primarily in the southeastern part of the country, in part, weather in Texas. We continue to see wet weather that's making it more difficult for logging conditions in that part of the market. But I think the more important aspect is higher demand for wood within our wood baskets driven by pellet mills in the Southeast, again particularly in Texas, Alabama and in Georgia. We're seeing again higher demand against those wood baskets to really driving cost up, and we expect that to continue for the foreseeable future. So the outlook that we have talked about in terms of wood cost, that really is the principal driver, I would say.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's very helpful, Bob. And then just on the SBS side and looking at the backlogs there. They're well above where the CUK side is. I'm kind of thinking about the end markets that doesn't appear that they're so different. So can you just talk about what is driving such a higher backlog level in bleached board versus the CUK business?", "John A. Luke", "Bob?", "Robert A. Feeser", "Alex, yes, I would say a couple of items there. We continue to see nice demand growth in our food service business in particular. That business is coming through a strong cup season. And we've continued to see good demand through the summer months and continue to expect that in the second half. The other source of strength is also on our liquid packaging business: strong global growth in that business, in particular in Asia Pacific, as well. And that's been an important part of our SBS growth.", "Robert K. Beckler", "I will just add. This is Bob Beckler. I would just add, even more broadly, even the food side of that, that business has held up fairly well. The non-food service food side has been relatively stable. And we've seen really good performance across the specialty side of that business, the tobacco board and the commercial print applications that have very high quality demands.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi.", "Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "It's actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. Have you seen any market share shifts in the beauty or personal care markets in the U.S.? It seems a competitor reported weaker results in North America relative to yours.", "John A. Luke", "Bob, do you prefer to address that?", "Robert K. Beckler", "As we indicated in our comments, the commercial approach that we're taking across beauty and personal care, not just North America but globally, has been very successful for us. The thing that I can point to there without getting too much into share so much is that we've really been working hard to position our focus in the most attractive markets in particularly beauty and personal care. Our fragrance applications for sprays have been particularly strong for us in North America certainly but abroad as well. So we're very pleased with the commercial gains that we're making in the business. And we see that continuing as we look to the third quarter and well into the next year.", "Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Great. And can you sparse out what specific end markets in Specialty Chemicals are driving the strong growth there?", "Robert K. Beckler", "Sure. This is Bob Beckler, and I'll take that one as well. So broadly, Specialty Chemicals is doing very well in pushing more of the mix into the high-value specialty end of the business. So that would be oilfield, asphalt, ink resins, adhesives. And on the activated carbon side, as I mentioned before, very strong performance in the automotive sector. This is the strategy of the business. It's not something new. This is something that they're constantly doing to continue to push both mix and the profitability of that business up. And we've invested in that business because we see tremendous upside to continue growing in all of those markets that I mentioned, in most cases, double-digit potential growth every year in those businesses.", "Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Great. And just one last one. Do you see any change to your strategic initiatives for the company just in the context of high-end shareholder activism recently?", "John A. Luke", "Our strategic priorities remain very much the same. And we believe that those are the absolute best ways to generate the industry-leading margins we have targeted as well as the initiatives that have been advanced by a range of shareholders.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "One quick verification. You mentioned the EBITDA target, the $1 billion to $1.25 billion (sic) [$1.025 billion] . I just want to be sure: Is -- the pension element of that, which I -- I suppose to be about $120 million or so, that's actually noncash. Is that the way to think about that?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "That is correct.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Okay, just wanted to be sure. And then I guess, a question on the Specialty Chemicals business. I remember, when you all invited a number of us down to Charleston 3 years ago and we got a chance to visit that, there's this -- I came away with the impression that the margins at that time that were -- then looked very good but aren't as high as they are now might be a little bit above kind of a normal level given the money you would be spending on growing the business. And you've actually successfully grown the business with the markets you're in, and yet the margins have actually gone up. And so now that you're looking ahead and seeing more opportunities, and you pointed out activated carbons in automotive, within automotive, do you now think that you can grow the business without any real change in the margin, all things being equal?", "John A. Luke", "Chip, I'll ask Bob Beckler to comment much more fully on that, but I think your recollection is sound. And what we have seen, as Bob has alluded already, is a step change in performance that is supported by a sound investment in market development as well as continuing focus on innovation and participation strategies that really let us leverage the capabilities we have. And I think these margins are clearly sustainable margins. Bob?", "Robert K. Beckler", "No, that's right, Chip. 3 years is a long time ago. And a lot has transpired, I think, since that investor conference. And we've really exceeded expectations over that period and not in a spike way. It's really been sustained over the last 3 years with EBITDA margins annually above 27%, which is about the run rate that we're at now, and we see that continuing as we go forward. What's happening that's driving that is the mix shift and the growth in those specialty markets that I described that are highly differentiated, that respond perfectly to the kinds of products that we offer that are different in those end markets. In some cases, it doesn't take a lot of investment to capture that kind of value because it's mix shift that's occurring within existing assets, but in other cases, it's global growth that's occurring that we're moving to invest and position ourselves for to stay out in front with the capability to maximize the value of those opportunities.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Got you, and that's very helpful. And then just one last quick one, for Mark. I might have misheard you, but I think you said that -- and as part of getting to the $75 million in cost saves, that I think the first quarter was 18 and the second quarter was 12. So I guess it looks like the quarterly run rate is still quite below that, but I might have misheard those numbers. How should we see that flow through the -- correct me, for the first half? And how should we see the second half?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, Chip, it was $9 million in the first quarter, $21 million in the second quarter. And we're looking to ramp up in line with that second quarter level.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Right, right. Which would already get you to $84 million on an annualized rate. That's very clear.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde [ph].", "Unknown Attendee", "Bob, just a question, first, on Rigesa. It sounds like you're selling into the export market and you're selling into that kind of the domestic board market down there. Is there -- should we assume that there is a lift as you can integrate more of that into your own converting business and bring the export tonnage back onshore in Brazil over time?", "Robert K. Beckler", "That's exactly right, Mark [ph]. That's the balance of this business that we work every day to maximize the profitability of the corrugated platform. It was the whole basis for the strategic investment that we made in Brazil several years back that we continue to work. The other balance that we strike on the corrugated side, particularly in a tough market, is to maximize our margins. And so we keep a very disciplined focus on the inflation in Brazil and offsetting that with both price and premium mix opportunities. And we're not pressured to push more of the board into the corrugated business just for the sake of volume.", "Unknown Attendee", "Yes, I think you've -- from what I can tell, you've been pretty disciplined about price down there. Is there any way, Bob, to just help people think about sort of that transition over time kind of as you pull back export tons and increase integration on the sort of financial impact and the timing?", "Robert K. Beckler", "Well, without getting into the financials so much, the idea is that we have enough capacity with the expansion that we did in Brazil to ultimately double the size of our corrugated platform and, along with that, double the profitability of the business. We still have our sights set on 30% EBITDA for the integrated packaging platform. We still believe that's very achievable. A little bit of a timing issue around the economy in Brazil, but we're tracking well.", "Unknown Attendee", "Okay. And then just a couple of other questions, one on any further divestitures that you guys anticipate this year. I think part of what's been helping you in some of the margins has been kind of getting rid of businesses like those carton businesses in Europe. So anything else likely over the next 6 months?", "John A. Luke", "Mark, go ahead.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, Mark, we constantly look at our business mix and how it's performing in the marketplace and the relative business model and the ability of those businesses or product lines to generate increasing levels of economic profit. And the market is a dynamic place, and we continue to keep that squarely in focus. So we think we've got a lot of that behind us, but things can change and we have our eye on the ball.", "John A. Luke", "I think that's right. And markets are, as Mark indicated and everyone knows, dynamic, and we're certainly seeing that right now. But the lens through which we're continuing to evaluate this ultimately comes back to the continuation of the economic profit drive and discipline that we have here and across the company.", "Unknown Attendee", "Okay. And then just on the other side of that: Are you interested in just really trying to improve existing operations in packaging right now? Or could we see you consider acquisitions over the next 6 to 12 months; and if so, acquisitions of any size?", "John A. Luke", "Mark, let me answer it this way: that we clearly evaluate opportunities as they come along. We feel we've got a strong obligation to do that. But to the first part of your question and as our comments today, hopefully, on the call have reinforced, we see significant upside by focusing intently on the strategies we have in place, with the assets we have in place and with the markets that we're continually improving our participation within. Again, that said, we don't turn away from things that might represent opportunities, but our primary focus here and across the company is on executing the strategy we have right in front of us.", "Jason Thompson", "Connie, we are through our allotted time. Could you please give out the dial-in information?", "Operator", "Yes, I will.", "Jason Thompson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 12 p.m. today through August 30, 2014.

Please go ahead.", "Jason Thompson", "Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. John Luke, Bob Beckler and Mark Rajkowski are here to review our third quarter results. We also have Bob Feeser here for Q&A as well.", "The notification for this call was broadly disclosed and it is being webcast at mwv.com, where slides are also available. Our results and commentary are presented on a continuing operations basis and are correct as of today, but could include time-sensitive information that is subject to change. In addition, any statements that are forward-looking are subject to known and unknown risks and are not guarantees of future performance.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Luke.", "John A. Luke", "Jason, thanks very much, and good morning, everyone. We continue to make strong progress, executing on our strategies for profitable growth and margin improvement during the third quarter. Our result demonstrate that we\u2019re on track toward our goal of achieving industry-leading margins, which we define is our EBITDA margin on a fully allocated basis excluding pension income by the end of 2015.", "In the third quarter, we increased revenue and EBITDA. We (technical difficulty) our cost structure, doing so against the backdrop of an increasingly challenging global economic environment. Overall, we nearly doubled earnings per share during the quarter, continuing a trend of steady improvement throughout the year that demonstrates the value and the impact of our strategy.", "Despite slowing or stagnant economic growth, we have continued to differentiate our business through market knowledge, targeted participation and innovative high-quality solutions that help our customers win in today\u2019s very competitive global marketplace. As a result, we are outperforming broader trend in most of the markets we serve. And we have punctuated this commercial performance with margin levels in each business that places in the range of our top peers and competitors, including notable progress in each of our packaging segments.", "We also continue to generate record level performance in our Specialty Chemicals segment with gains in each of our key markets. Overall, we\u2019ve made solid progress on both the top and bottom line this year and we\u2019re confident that our determined, commercial and operational focus will extend our current momentum and result in long-term sustainable success.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Bob Beckler for additional commentary about our performance and our outlook. Bob?", "Robert K. Beckler", "Thank you, John. Throughout the year, in the third quarter, we continued to strengthen our performance with balanced commercial and operational execution in each of our business segments, along with continued improvement in efficiency and cost structure.", "As John underscored, we are focused on delivering leadership margins in each segment and we are well on track to achieve those goals. I\u2019ll briefly summarize the performance in each of the segment and provide some color behind the numbers.", "Beginning with the Food & Beverage segment. Third quarter sales increased 7% versus prior year, while EBITDA increased nearly 16% resulting in a margin improvement of 140 basis points for the quarter. This improvement was driven by continued share gains in many of our targeted markets, improved operating productivity and benefit from our capital investments over the past year.", "Packaging paperboard demand remained strong throughout the quarter, especially for food and tobacco application as we continue to win with our differentiated paperboard solution that provide our global customers with productivity and quality advantages.", "Food revenue increased 4%, as strong food service shipment more than offset weakness in packaged food and some deceleration we\u2019ve seen in liquid packaging markets. Tobacco volume was also strong, as we gained share globally with our quality paperboard that runs with high efficiency on our customers packing lines.", "In beverage, we grew revenue 3% driven by gains in North America, Asia and Latin America. No question, beverage markets are very dynamic around the world, but overall we continue to grow this business by targeting key brand owners who require the full suite of innovative packaging solutions, high performance machinery and flexibility to respond in a rapidly changing marketplace. As a result, we are gaining positions across the full sector ranging from the big brands to the medium and small accounts including the fast growing craft brew sector.", "On the operations side of Food & Beverage, we increased productivity with strong performance at our mills even with $15 million of higher wood cost compared to last year. In the Covington mill, the new biomass boiler has been a tremendous positive, making that large-scale SBS facility now 100% self-sufficient for electricity.", "As we look to the fourth quarter, which comes with the typical year-end seasonality, there are several specific challenges we will be managing. Continued weakness in packaged food and liquid packaging, ongoing wood cost inflation and negative impact from foreign currency exchange. Having said that, we still expect fourth quarter earnings in Food & Beverage to improve modestly versus prior year, driven by solid operational execution and commercial momentum across our diverse global markets.", "Turning to Home, Health & Beauty, quarterly earnings doubled compared to last year resulting in a 180 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin. Year-to-date, EBITDA margin for the segment is above 15%, which represents a 320 basis point improvement compared to 2013 and demonstrates the significant commercial and operational progress we have made.", "Revenue in the third quarter was up 4%, excluding sales from the folding carton businesses in Brazil and Europe that we exited the past year. Dispensing sales were up 6% driven by strong growth in fragrance, trigger sprayers for home cleaning and aerosol actuators for air care.", "In the quarter, we also increased sales in healthcare adherence applications. In this business, we have now completed the transition to our Shellpak Renew paperboard product line, extended our contract with a major retail customer and launched adherence solutions with several high profile branded pharmaceuticals.", "Our innovation pipeline in Home, Health & Beauty is strong, with multiple new product launches having an impact across the business this year. And we continue to make investment this quarter, completing the move to a larger facility in Milan to support new projects and additional growth over time.", "In the fourth quarter we expect segment earnings to be higher than last year, about the same order of magnitude as in the third quarter. The overall business slowed slightly towards the end of the year, as we build inventory for next year\u2019s lawn and garden season and accommodate customer slowdowns around the holidays. Also, we will have higher resin prices, which, due to timing, won\u2019t get pass through until the end of the quarter.", "In industrial packaging, sales grew 14% and earnings were up 63% resulting in 580 basis points of EBITDA margin improvement versus prior year. In Brazil, economic conditions remain weak and continue to pressure industrial production and consumption in the region. Despite the lingering challenges there, we achieved 2% volume growth in corrugated packaging and 36% year-on-year growth in kraftliner sales.", "In third quarter we set a new production record at our Tres Barras mill. And this combination of strong, operational and commercial execution resulted in a 30% EBITDA margin in the quarter, the high end of our targeted range for the year.", "In India, we increased sales by almost 30% during the quarter. Fourth quarter will mark two years since our initial acquisition of mill operations in India and we are continuing to make progress with our long-term strategy of building high-quality containerboard positions with the growing corrugated market in that region. This includes the ongoing ramp up of a new machine at one of our two mills in Gujarat state.", "Overall outlook for industrial packaging is for slightly better fourth quarter results than last year. In Brazil, we expect quarterly EBITDA margin will come in somewhat below the third quarter level, given the seasonality and the timing of our annual mill outage, but full year EBITDA should still be well in the targeted range for the year.", "Our Specialty Chemicals business continues to perform strongly. Third quarter sales grew 9% and earnings grew 5% with an EBITDA margin of 27%. This business continues to grow and gain share globally in its targeted specialty markets: oilfield chemicals, asphalt innovations and activated carbon with unique products supported by the deep applications expertise we bring to our customers in each market. In the fourth quarter, we expect segment profit for Specialty Chemicals to be modestly higher than last year.", "And finally, in our Community Development and Land Management business, activity is picking up across the major developments we have in the growing Charleston, South Carolina region. The two largest projects, Nexton and East Edisto, are well positioned to take advantage of a growing economy and new residential demand in the region. At Nexton, the initial retail and office development is nearly complete and we expect to sell lots to homebuilders by the end of the year, and as these data show, the timeline is right on track with a planned launch of the community in the spring of 2015.", "To summarize, the margin improvement we\u2019ve been steadily making is really a testament to good execution on the fundamentals for strategy. Focused participation in the global market, strong operational execution and cost discipline. We still have more work to do and now without challenges in global market. But we are confident in continuing our positive momentum to achieve the targeted leadership global margin, we envision across each segment.", "And with that, I will turn the call over to Mark to discuss our financial results.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Thanks, Bob. We had a strong quarter across all of our key financial measures with standout performance in a few areas that I\u2019ll highlight as they clearly demonstrate our strategy is working and our execution is on track. First, our 7% sales growth in the quarter reflects the benefit of our improved commercial capabilities centered on selling our higher value product offerings.", "We\u2019re very pleased with our continued ability to increase volume, largely to share gain, which accounted for over five points of our top line growth. In our differentiated higher value packaging and specialty chemicals solutions generated more profitable revenue as reflected in our overall price mix improvement in the quarter. We also generated excellent operating leverage in the quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $285 million, or nearly 20% of sales.", "Each of our packaging business is delivered double-digit EBITDA growth. Our margin expansion in the quarter was driven by better productivity in our facilities and excellent benefits from the capital investment we\u2019ve made in our mills, as well as lower SG&A resulting from our cost reduction activities.", "Adjusted gross margin improved 210 basis points to approximately 23% sales, and adjusted SG&A improved by 160 basis points to 9.5% of sales and declined over 8% on an absolute basis. We achieved another $26 million of savings associated with our margin improvement program in the quarter, bringing our total for the year-to-date of $56 million. With the remaining actions, we\u2019ve identified, we expect to exceed our $75 million target for 2014, and achieve our $125 million savings target by 2015.", "Finally, free cash flow on the quarter improved by approximately $70 million year-over-year, due to higher earnings and lower capital spending. We defined free cash flow as cash after CapEx and dividends. CapEx through the first nine months was $214 million, which is down from $337 million in the same period last year.", "The difference reflects lower project capital related to the Covington biomass boiler, which was commissioned in the fourth quarter of last year. Total CapEx for the year will be approximately $350 million. During the quarter, we also used $40 million of cash to repurchase shares in connection with our previously announced program, which we completed earlier this month.", "Just a quick update on the work we\u2019re undertaking to bring our corporate cost allocation methodology in line with peers. We expect to complete this work in the first quarter next year, and begin reporting segment result under the new allocation methodology at that time.", "Now turning to the outlook. In the fourth quarter, we expect to see continued significant earnings momentum year-over-year. As Bob noted, we expect year-over-year profit increases in each segment, as we continue to execute well commercially, and operationally, and effectively manage the controllables. However, the rate of our year-over-year improvement will moderate, compared to the first nine months of the year, due to the negative impacts, we\u2019re now seeing from weaker foreign currency, as well as some weakening demand conditions in Europe, and certain food packaging category.", "With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to John.", "John A. Luke", "Mark, thanks very much. We are and will remain under landing in our pursuit of profitable growth and best-in-class margins in each of our businesses, and we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll be successful. And that our strategy will enable us to continue to grow profitably and deliver value to our shareholders.", "We\u2019ll now be happy to turn the floor over to you and answer any questions that you might have of us this morning.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.", "Mark A. Weintraub \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Good morning. just one quick question on the cost improvement or cost reduction, I believe in the first quarter, you said you\u2019ve got $9 million; in the second quarter, you\u2019ve got $21 million. Do you have a number for the third quarter?", "Robert K. Beckler", "$26 million, Mark.", "Mark A. Weintraub \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "$26 million, okay, great. And then in terms of NetSpend and/or East Edisto, can you frame for us at all centers to what type of contribution is realistic, as we kind of look ahead for the next year, as some of these projects begin to ramp into commercial mode?", "Robert K. Beckler", "Hey, Mark. I think that contribution through most of next year will be really marginal. they\u2019re still finishing the development phase in NetSpend as well as East Edisto, which a community that we\u2019ve got underway there that will ramp up in the first part of 2015, but we certainly expect by 2016 that our partnerships there will be substantially cash flow positive with those cash flow streams growing in the years beyond that.", "Mark A. Weintraub \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay. Thank you.", "Robert K. Beckler", "Thanks Mark.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from CLSA. Please go ahead.", "Mark W. Connelly \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC", "John and Bob, you alluded to the changes in the beverage market. The big beverage customers on the soft drinks side are not seeing much growth in core products and there is fairly good reason to think that\u2019s probably going to continue for a while. Can you talk about how that\u2019s going to affect the balance in your CUK business and how much of your business currently is soft drink, beer and food particularly in the U.S. and how much the overseas trends can help offset that?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yeah. Mark, let me offer a couple of question or a couple of comments of the asset, then I\u2019ll turn to Bob. I think you\u2019ve heard on with your last point one of the key areas of opportunity, clearly there are domestic challenges in both the beer and the soft drink business. But I think we\u2019re seeing good creativity coming out of both as the promotions take place and in the beer side certainly as there is a very positive response to us going on in the craft sector.", "more broadly what we\u2019re saying is, there is continued growth in both areas on a global basis and given the positioning we have, and the investments that we\u2019re prepare to make to get support continuing growth around the world. We see good opportunity to continue to enjoy the benefits that come from growing the global beverage markets. Bob?", "Robert K. Beckler", "And just building on John\u2019s comment, we\u2019re managing a very flexible model around the CNK platform, I think very effectively. While the headlines are around carbonated soft drinks. We\u2019re actually doing quite well, holding our ground in CSD, if you consider there our multipack formats really serve the can market in that sector.", "In terms of your question around balance, we\u2019re roughly one-third soft drinks, two-thirds beer. And that model continues to flux and particularly flux globally, as we see tremendous opportunity for growth in the global and particularly developing markets. We\u2019re having some success with format shifts. to some extent, we\u2019re corrugated, but largely, we see opportunity in converting from plastic shrink, where we\u2019ve had examples, specific examples of that in Latin America, Asia-Pacific and even recently a case in North America.", "so still there is a lot of opportunity there despite the overwriting dynamics. And the other thing that we like just to finish off is the fact that it\u2019s a dynamic market that requires agility and responsiveness. And we feel like we\u2019re very well positioned globally to be able to operate in that dynamic and provide brand owners with the total support that they need, not just the pack, but innovations and design expertise and very flexible machinery options to suit their needs.", "Mark W. Connelly \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC", "", "That\u2019s helpful. And just changing gears for a second. If we look at your Specialty Chemicals business, it just keeps running and running and you found a lots of new places to go. If we do see a slow down in exploration and fracking, is that going to finally slow down the performance of that business?", "John A. Luke", "Bob?", "Robert K. Beckler", "I mean, it\u2019s a great question. We have not seen that at this stage Mark. The business is pretty diverse in terms of the end market applications that it serves, fracking is just one component of many in the oilfield sector that we\u2019re going after and making gains. We\u2019re actually continuing to take share in the market. And I would say at this stage, we\u2019ve not seen overall demand, tail-off given the cooling off of oil prices. Our perspective would be that you have to get down below $70 per barrel to really see any significant amount of drilling and production come off of the table.", "And even then if that were to happen which I think is probably a bit of the long shot \u2013 we\u2019ve got a very flexible operating model, which goes back to the way that we refine our products and flex our products across multiple specialty end markets. So we\u2019re very mindful of the dynamic that you\u2019re rightly pointing to, Mark, but we feel very good about our ability to grow in that sector for a long-time.", "Mark W. Connelly \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC", "Thank you very much.", "Robert K. Beckler", "Thanks Mark.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "George L. Staphos \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. Hi Rob and good morning. Thanks for the details. Nice job on the slide deck by the way. Again, I guess, my first question I wanted to piggyback on Mark\u2019s question. So to the extent that we\u2019re seeing over time increased share growth of the can and the packing mix for the beer in particular. Does that help you given your overall exposure to beer relative to soft drink or does glass pack and paperboard just as much as cans in non-North American markets.", "", "Robert K. Beckler", "Well, we\u2019re seeing opportunity in both, but I would say that can volume is the lead driver of the opportunity that we\u2019re seeing particularly in the developing markets if you think about the conversion from shrink. But we\u2019ve seen opportunity in bottles as well. Latin America being a good example where our customers are really working hard to improve the retail shop appearance of their products, both can and bottle, and multipack is a excellent solution to premiumize the brands.", "George L. Staphos \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Bob, just a quick on that. I mean as you premiumize, do you still see more use of paperboard with a returnable glass bottle or would you tend to see the paperboard pack work more and more with a one way glass package?", "Robert K. Beckler", "That\u2019s a great question. We\u2019re seeing a little bit of both and in fact we\u2019re actually doing returnable glass bottle in high-end corrugated packaging down in Latin America. We\u2019ve seen a pretty good uptick in that application over the past year, but I think ultimately the trend is more heavily directed towards one way.", "", "George L. Staphos \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thanks for that. I will ask two quick ones and turn it over. You had very nice progress in corporate spending that\u2019s obviously been something that the investment committee has been focused on for you for a number of years. Do you think that you could continue this type of year-on-year progress into the fourth quarter and the first half of 2015 as we saw in the third quarter? And then back to Home, Health & Beauty, given recent health concerns around the world, have you seen any kind of uptick in your dispensing for hand sanitization products and that sort of thing. Thanks guys.", "John A. Luke", "", "Yes, George, this is John. Let me just comment on the later part of the question and I will ask Bob or Mark to elaborate and then Mark can pick up your corporate class. I think the early signs would suggest that we are seeing a little bit of an uptick, but that\u2019s building on a base that was established as a much stronger base for that business a few years ago, the H1N1. Clearly, there were early signs of activity, how large it will get remains to be same. Bob, any\u2026?", "Robert K. Beckler", "Yes, I just would add to that. It was a pretty big deal for us with the H1N1 issue that that came out a few years ago. It\u2019s pretty early right now to say that there is going to be much of a shift, but we\u2019re definitely monitoring it. And we\u2019re very close with our customers on it particularly around hand cleaning and sanitizing application.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Yes, George. We\u2019ve made good progress through the first nine months. We expect that to continue into the fourth quarter and into 2015 and that continues to be an area of focus for us and we made a lot of progress but we\u2019ll more to do.", "George L. Staphos \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "", "I mean sequentially should we see any kind of retracement or you feel pretty good about the gap you\u2019ve opened up so far for the next couple of quarters?", "", "Robert K. Beckler", "Yes, no, I think you should expect those levels to be fairly consistent with what we just posted in Q3. I mean there is always...", "", "George L. Staphos \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Understood.", "Robert K. Beckler", "The odd accrual here or there, but that the fundamental structure \u2013 those changes are permanent.", "", "George L. Staphos \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Robert K. Beckler", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.", "Adam J. Josephson \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning everyone.", "John A. Luke", "Hi, Adam.", "Robert K. Beckler", "Good morning, Adam.", "Adam J. Josephson \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "John, just the obligatory MLP question for you and my apologies for asking, but can you provide us with any updated thoughts regarding putting some of your assets into such a structure?", "John A. Luke", "Adam, no apologies necessary. Let me make a couple of comments and I will ask Mark to follow-on. I think it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019re opened to any structure that would enhance shareholder value and that\u2019s certainly includes the MLP concept. It certainly one that has proven interesting and capture the attention of a good deal of the industry and certainly the investment community. And we\u2019re learning a lot from our own continuing assessment and from others who were speaking out publicly on it as well.", "All of that said, and as our investors would expect, we are attaching a priority focus right now to evaluating the value maximization alternatives for our chemical business as we\u2019ve talked back since September. And that\u2019s been our principle focus, but MLP certainly would be on the table. Mark?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "We spent more time learning about understanding the structure and while complex it is certainly very interesting and no question that we will be further assessing those benefits, the implications. But as you point out, our priority has been really \u2013 and we\u2019re very focused on assessing the strategic alternatives to maximizing the value of our specialty chemicals business. So that has been and will continue to remain our priority.", "Adam J. Josephson \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Thanks Mark and John. John, just one on chemicals. Can you provide us with any updated thoughts you have on maximizing the value of that business, I know you talked about that at a conference about a month and half ago, but any update would be appreciated?", "John A. Luke", "I think the update I would offer would be that we stated our intent back in September remain true to that commitment.", "Adam J. Josephson \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Okay. And Mark, forgive me if I missed this, but any change to your previously stated EBITDA guidance for this year of $1 billion to $1.25 billion?", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "I think as you heard on the call today, we\u2019ve got a lot of momentum. We\u2019re managing the controllables extremely well. We\u2019re going to continue to do that. I think it\u2019s important to have \u2013 put all that context as you\u2019ve, I\u2019m sure, read and heard and certainly, it\u2019s no difference for us the global economic environment has gotten more volatile, more uncertain. We are seeing some weakening of demand in Europe as well as in certain of our food packaging categories.", "And I think the other thing to keep in mind is that since our last call, we\u2019ve seen a substantial decline over 10% in the last several months in the value currencies in Europe and Brazil. But that said, we are continuing to manage very aggressively. We\u2019re looking to pull all the levers and we\u2019re intensely focused on delivering that $1 billion of EBITDA.", "Adam J. Josephson \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Thanks a lot Mark. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Bank of Montreal", "Good morning.", "John A. Luke", "Hi, Mark.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Bank of Montreal", "I wanted to talk first about the industrial packaging business. Anything that would keep you from kind of maintaining that 30% number down in Brazil going forward?", "John A. Luke", "I think we\u2019re very comfortable with the progress we\u2019re marking Mark. You know that business, as well as anyone on the call and I think we\u2019re very enthusiastic, clearly it\u2019s a bit more of a challenging environment, but I will ask Bob Beckler to comment on lot of the leverage that we\u2019re pulling down there to ensure that we continue to drive forward progress. Bob?", "Robert K. Beckler", "Mark, we not so subtly highlighted the fact that we hit the 30% EBITDA target in the third quarter, down in Brazil, which had been on the high end of our 25% to 30% range for the year. As I indicated in the outlook and probably won\u2019t be quite that in the fourth quarter. But the point there is that it\u2019s really encouraging with progress that we\u2019re making with the mill hitting its production target now with still opportunity to further optimize the mix and the cost of production with the expanded platform that we have there.", "And I would add with the corrugated market, it\u2019s performing very weakly, I would say in the given economy without much prospect at least this far. We can see under the future for much improvement. So our strategy is working and it\u2019s working well in a pretty difficult environment and it\u2019s just this combination of the power of the investment that we made down in Brazil. And the commercial strategy that we have that\u2019s very, very focused on the corrugated side, not to mention the great success that we\u2019re seeing in leveraging our new supply of kraftliner in the market.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Bank of Montreal", "Okay. And I just wanted to turn over to food and beverage and I think if you can give us a little more color on where you\u2019re picking up share and then also if we continue to see kind of paper board do well in food service. Is there any potential for you to re-start any of the idle capacity that you have. And I know you have at least one machine at Evadale, it\u2019s \u2013 that is idle and I can\u2019t recall whether you have idle capacity at Covington?", "Robert K. Beckler", "Great question, Mark. Bob Feeser, you want to comment on that?", "Robert A. Feeser", "Yeah. Hey, Mark. We are continuing to see as you mentioned good share gain in the food service market, certainly the shift from foam to paper board have been a positive and we\u2019re working closely with our major customers to drive that change. We\u2019re also seeing very good success broadly in SBS, across a number of food applications, frozen food in particular, where we continue to develop good business in that area.", "In regards to capacity you rightly point out that we do have a machine in Evadale that we had shut down from paper board capacity several years ago. We would not be planning on re-starting that machine to manufacture paper board in the near future.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Bank of Montreal", "Okay, that is great. And then just one final one, John, can we discuss the thoughts on kind of succession planning on where we\u2019re at there?", "Robert A. Feeser", "Well, Mark you\u2019ve asked that periodically. I think we have a board that is actively focused on succession planning and a good process is in place.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Bank of Montreal", "Okay, good enough. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.", "Chip A. Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "", "Yes, and good morning everyone. First question just a small one, but, I think you have mentioned the increase in profitability you would expect to see in home, health and beauty would be similar in the fourth quarter than as it was in the third, is that in a percentage term or in absolute dollars?", "John A. Luke", "It\u2019s \u2013 Chip, it\u2019s absolute dollars.", "Chip A. Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "", "Okay, that is helpful. Secondly, I know it\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019re probably into the process of the recasting of the Corporate expense. I know you still have quite a bit of work left ahead of you, but intuitively one would think that probably a lower proportion from looking at sales would go to chemicals, because I know you manage that business and it\u2019s more or less stand alone down in Charleston, where my guess is the other segments outside of Rigesa, of course, are managed closer to home in Richmond and is that fair to say that a greater proportion versus sales of that recasting will be borne by those operations in Richmond?", "John A. Luke", "Chip, we\u2019re still working through that. I mean your observations certainly are logical, but we don\u2019t want to get ahead of the curve here, we are still going through that work and, our focus is really going to be looking at the level of activity and support that we are providing to each of the segments and that is what is going to drive the answer.", "Chip A. Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "", "Okay. And I noticed this year that working capital, if you leave out cash and debt in the current accounts is a bit higher than last year. And I didn\u2019t know if that is sort of a new run rate that needed to support, maybe more products especially in home health and beauty or do you think that it may come down a bit low, what\u2019s we\u2019ve seen in the past?", "John A. Luke", "Yes, Chip there is some of that is certainly influenced by the growth, both in terms of receivables and inventories, a little bit of that is timing on some of the sales, but we\u2019re always looking at driving as much efficiency in our supply chain, including working capital as possible. And we\u2019re not looking at any subsident change in terms of what we would expect in terms of cash to cash cycle on a long-term basis.", "", "Chip A. Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "", "And then just one last quick one, tax rate came down nicely. I\u2019m sure that was geographic mix. Could you give us some view as to how we should think about the fourth quarter maybe next year? And also would CapEx likely change what is going in the next year?", "John A. Luke", "Chip you\u2019re absolutely right that the change what you saw in the effective tax rate in the quarter was really effective, the cumulative catch up as we do our GAAP accounting to recognize that the rate that we had in there through the first three quarters, which was 31%. We now expect the full year to be at 30% so all of that gets reflected in the third quarter provision. So, we do expect full-year and therefore fourth quarter tax rate to be 30%.", "Chip A. Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "And CapEx?", "John A. Luke", "CapEx $350 million is where we expect to in the year.", "Chip A.

Glazerman \u2013 UBS Investment Bank", "Hi, good morning.", "John A. Luke", "Good morning Gail.", "Robert A. Feeser", "Good morning.", "Gail S. Glazerman \u2013 UBS Investment Bank", "I guess maybe just quickly on CapEx on Chip\u2019s comment. $350 million is a pretty big step up from where you\u2019re through three quarters, are there any particularly unique project that was going out that are happening in the fourth quarter?", "John A. Luke", "No \u2013 this is not an unusual phenomenon in terms of the spending. We typically see a little bit of a bump in the fourth quarter Bob.", "Robert A. Feeser", "Hi, Gail it\u2019s Bob Feeser. In general, we would see probably 34% to 35% of our total capital spend take place in the fourth quarter. So as we looked at where we are tracking after three quarters. This is pretty typical, so we would expect to really land it close to $350 million overall for the quarter.", "Gail S. Glazerman \u2013 UBS Investment Bank", "Okay and just kind of looking at the environment and maybe a couple of products in particular. 19% volume growth in tobacco is that sustainable what geography, is it coming from? Is it catch up from prior quarters, can you just give a little bit of color there?", "Robert A. Feeser", "Yeah, Gail, this is Bob Feeser again. Just a little bit of color on that. We\u2019re really making some solid gains in China with our paper board, primarily in the high end brands, where they\u2019re still switching from soft pack to hard pack. And our product really has a very strong value proposition in the high speed packing lines that see being installed in China.", "So we believe that there is still good upside in growth in China, based on the dynamics that we see. So the majority of what we experienced in the third quarter was that growth in China.", "Gail S. Glazerman \u2013 UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And CNK volumes were down a little bit year-on-year it seems like that backlogs are down fairly significantly year-on-year. Is there anything going on there?", "Robert A. Feeser", "And Gail it\u2019s \u2013 I mean it\u2019s not a substantial trend for us, because beverage is remaining very, very strong and helping offset some of the weakness that we have been reporting over the last couple of quarters on the food packaging side.", "Gail S. Glazerman \u2013 UBS Investment Bank", "Okay and just broadly on the demand environment, you talked about increasingly challenged environment and some pressure on food, some others have talked about \u2013 may defines that some of the food company, I\u2019m just trying to get a little bit more promotional. Do you have any sense of that? And just in general, it sounds like Europe is perhaps where the biggest changes but can you just confirm that and just talk about what has changed on the demand environment quarter-over-quarter?", "John A. Luke", "Gail, let me offer a couple of comments and then I\u2019ll turn it Bob to embellish on. I think overall we are seeing food companies responding, there is more promotional activity, and we are operating as we\u2019ve commented several times and what is a rapidly changing and challenged global economy environment. That said we\u2019ve operated around the world for a long period of time.", "We understand how the maneuver these trends. And we have focused very heavily over time on the end markets in which we participate and then looking to participate with a very measured and focused strategies. And that\u2019s really was driving our activity and frankly has led to advantage for us and what otherwise has been a challenging European market that you referred to. Bob?", "Robert K. Beckler", "You\u2019re right Gail that the food companies are under some pressure globally. I think it\u2019s been widely reported that there is declining consumer spending as a percent of discretionary spend on food and to some extent beverage items that they\u2019re contending with.", "So I think it would not be a surprise to see promotional activity pickup in that environment. Although, it hasn\u2019t really been a tremendous driver of our business at this stage where we\u2019ve been effective I think and operating in this environment is and really targeting our participation very carefully in the markets with brand owners pulling through our higher quality substrates for applications were it really make sense to drive the quality, premiumisation and to some extent higher productive as Bob reflected around tobacco.", "We see the same thing on the food side. I just also comment in closing off that one of the trends that we believe that is a play certainly in North America and Europe and maybe globally just to shift from I\u2019d just say processed foods to more fresh and perceived healthy alternatives and this is creating some shift in the retail environment that is still playing out we believe and while creating some dynamics there that that may make a challenging for packaging companies that also creates opportunity.", "Gail S. Glazerman \u2013 UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And just one last quick one, would cost inflation obviously it\u2019s up significantly year-on-year, is it stabilizing, still getting worse or getting any better?", "Robert K. Beckler", "Gail, we would still expect to see pretty healthy wood cost inflation in the fourth quarter on the order of magnitude of $8 million to $10 million year-over-year and that\u2019s really driven by a couple of things, continued wet weather in the Southeast, but more importantly subsidized European palette demand in our wood baskets that\u2019s really having an impact in that region. So while there\u2019s \u2013 I think there has been some moderation quarter-to-quarter. We still continue to expect higher inflations around wood in that Southeast area.", "Gail S. Glazerman \u2013 UBS Investment Bank", "Okay, thanks very much.", "Robert K. Beckler", "Yeah.", "John A. Luke", "Thank you Gail.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Punjabi from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.", "Mehul M. Dalia \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Hi good morning. It\u2019s actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. How are you doing?", "John A. Luke", "Good morning.", "Robert K. Beckler", "Good morning.", "Mehul M. Dalia \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Good morning. Can you quantify your profitability goal that you expect to reach for the end of 2015?", "John A. Luke", "I\u2019ve missed the question. I heard quantify something in 2015.", "Robert K. Beckler", "Yeah could you repeat?", "Mehul M. Dalia \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "", "Yes, sorry. Can you quantify the profitability goal that you were talking about in your prepared remarks that you expect to reach by the end of 2015?", "John A. Luke", "We haven\u2019t \u2013 yes, you\u2019re talking about the margins?", "Mehul M. Dalia \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Yes, exactly.", "Robert K. Beckler", "Yes John laid out at the start of the call, what we\u2019re focused on is having performance levels in each of our segments that are at or better than our peers in each of those segments by the end of 2015. And as John stated the way we look at that is really on an all-in basis allocating all of our corporate costs excluding pension income. And we did not specifically set out a range at this point.", "Mehul M. Dalia \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Okay, it makes sense. There is still a fair amount of cash on your balance sheet. What do you think as an appropriate level of cash to carry on a normalized basis?", "Robert K. Beckler", "Well, we just completed a pretty substantial buyback and we look at how we can best economically deploy that cash on a regular basis. As you look at how we operate around the world and while we have, I would say, a very sophisticated global cash management program, the nature of our operations requires us to hold a couple $100 million of cash at a point of time. So there is some capacity there, but it\u2019s modest at this point.", "Mehul M. Dalia \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Great, thank you.", "Robert K. Beckler", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Thank you. Good morning everyone.", "John A. Luke", "Hi, Alex.", "Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "On the bleached board side, I mean, the industry was trying to push through an open market price increase in the fall, is there an update on how that\u2019s progressing?", "John A. Luke", "Beckler?", "Robert K. Beckler", "Hi, Alex. This is Bob Beckler. We\u2019ve seen the reports obviously I would just say for us it\u2019s still a work-in progress and I wouldn\u2019t comment further on specific levels at this stage. It\u2019s obviously more challenging in the second half of the year than the first wave that came through in the first half of the year that we were very successful with. So we\u2019re still working it. And I think from a fourth quarter perspective, we\u2019ll still be up on price year-on-year and backlogs remained firm and we\u2019re going to have to continue to work to address the wood cost inflation particularly that Bob referenced earlier.", "Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Got it. I appreciate that color. And then inflation side, in the quarter I think you\u2019ve reported about $22 million of inflation on the raw material side. Can you just give a little bit of color of how that breaks out between wood and other important inputs? And then just thinking about the energy spectrum and oil prices are lower if that\u2019s sustainable, how do you see that potentially impacting the cost structure in the business?", "John A. Luke", "Bob Feeser, do you want to comment on that?", "Robert A. Feeser", "Sure. In general for the quarter, as we mentioned, wood really represented the majority of that impact year-over-year, but we also saw increases in resin for the quarter that represented the balance, across the board everything else was largely flat benign year-over-year. In terms of oil and the impact on our raw materials going forward, we would expect to see some benefit around logistics and transportation cost going forward.", "As a result of that we\u2019ve actually seen a bit of a disconnect between oil and natural gas with many of our raw materials over the last five years. So we have seen some benefit with natural gas falling across many of our chemical based raw materials.", "Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay.", "John A. Luke", "And I would just comment as a footnote to that Alex that as we\u2019ve talked over time, you sort through all the puts and takes and Bob Beckler alluded to and it\u2019s going to be very important for us to ensure that our pricing structure reflects inflationary forces that are there. And that\u2019s a key part of maintaining our zeal towards the market leading margins.", "Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Got it John. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll turn it over.", "John A. Luke", "Thank you, Alex.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "George L. Staphos \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my follow-on. Very quickly this comes up periodically. Can you comment at all in terms of the export markets and whether they\u2019d become any more challenging for SBS, given the Asian capacity that\u2019s coming in. I am going to guess the answer is no, given the growth you\u2019re seeing in tobacco board, but if you have any additional color took it off around that positive or negatively?", "And then within especially chemicals the FX impact was fairly substantial, could you give us some rules of thumb in terms of FX sensitivity specifically to that segment? Thanks and good luck in the quarter. Thank you George, Bob Feeser and then Bob Beckler.", "Robert A. Feeser", "", "Sure. Yeah George, in regard to SBS and China dynamic, in general we continue to perform very well in China, Indonesia more broadly, again based on the engineered substrates that we have in tobacco and liquid packaging and our ability to really compete on a differentiated basis versus the Chinese competitors.", "We also haven\u2019t seen any significant importation of Chinese paperboard into the U.S either that\u2019s having any meaningful impact on our business, so we\u2019re continuing to monitor that situation closely, but I feel very good about our competitive position.", "Robert K. Beckler", "On your specialty chem question, actually the effects that impact in specialty chem, is really not altogether difference than in out other businesses, what you\u2019re seeing there on the water fall is reflection of onetime benefit that we had in third quarter of 2013, that were tax and insurance settlement related, so if you strike those out it was pretty much on par with the rest of the business.", "Michael Fitzmaurice", "Yes, it\u2019s $1 million or $2 million in the quarter.", "George L. Staphos \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thank you guys.", "Robert K. Beckler", "", "Thanks George.", "E. Mark Rajkowski", "Thank you.", "John A. Luke", "Okay Greg, can you please give out the replay information we look forward to taking with everyone next quarter, thank you.", "Robert A. Feeser", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen this conference will be available for replay afternoon Eastern Time today through November 28.

I am joined this morning by Ward Dickson, Chief Financial Officer, Jim Porter, President of our Paper Solutions business and Mike Kiepura, President of our Packaging Solutions business.", "During the course of the call, we\u2019ll make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs, related to future events. These segments may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discussed, during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent 10-K and 10-Qs filed for the quarters ending December 31, 2013, March 31, 2014 and June 30, 2014.", "We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We\u2019ve provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation, which is available on our website.", "I\u2019m going to begin by discussing our operating results, and then Ward will discuss our balance sheet, pension and other financial measures. I\u2019ll complete our prepared remarks with comments on our outlook. Then Ward, Jim, Mike and I will be available for your questions.", "The Rock-Tenn team delivered solid operating results in the September quarter. We made progress both in the marketplace and at our operating locations. We improved productivity by $41 million in the September quarter and $108 million for the entire fiscal year.", "Adjusted earnings were $1.31 per share and free cash flow for the quarter was $261 million or $1.80 per share. Over the last 12 months free cash flow grew by more than 9% to $6.10 per share above our guidance figure $6 per share. Our free cash flow of almost $900 million for the fiscal year represents a very attractive return and our equity market capitalization of about $7 billion.", "During the quarter, we repurchased $3.2 million Rock-Tenn shares at an average price of approximately $50. During fiscal year 2014, we bought back $236 million worth of Rock-Tenn stock this amounted to $4.7 million shares on a split adjusted basis. Our remaining Board approved authorization was $8.7 million shares. On October 24, we announced that the Rock-Tenn Board had authorized a 7% increase in our dividend to a new annual rate of $0.75 per share.", "During fiscal year 2014, we implemented our balance capital allocation approach by investing $534 million back into our business via capital expenditures, investing $474 million in acquisitions that have improved our business and we returned $337 million to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.", "All of this was accomplished within our two times leverage ratio target. We\u2019re continuing to deliver attractive free cash flow returns for our shareholders have the opportunity to improve these returns by deploying our cash flow to support our operating and business strategy, and by returning capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and consistent increases to our dividend.", "Sales for the quarter $2,608 million set another record. Included in our fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.31 is $0.10 per share in income from the recording of divisional value of spare parts of the former Smurfit containerboard mills.", "At the point of comparison, last year September quarterly adjusted EPS of a $1.33 included a $0.05 gain from the recording of the additional value of spare parts of the former Smurfit mills, its $0.04 benefit from the successful renegotiation of our steam contract with Seminole mill and another $0.04 gain from an insurance settlement of property damage claims at Demopolis.", "Also in last year\u2019s September quarter we benefited from an effective book tax rate of only 31% due to $0.09 per share impact of certain favorable tax items. These four items aggregated to $0.22 per share in last year\u2019s September quarter.", "Summering, our EPS of $1.31 per share and this year\u2019s September quarter reflects very strong operating performance compared to last year and also compared to our expectations entering the quarter.", "Our total company credit agreement EBITDA margin over the last 12 months is 16.4%, about 60 basis point higher than the 15.8% for the 12 months in the September of 2013. Our balance sheet continues to be in great shape, the leverage ratio of 1.92 times that consistent with our two times leverage target.", "Turing to our corrugated packaging segment, Industry containerboard mill operating rates averaged 96.7% for the quarter this was higher than the June quarter rate 96.28% and slightly lower than last year\u2019s September quarter operating rate of 97.3%.Our containerboard mill operating rate for the quarter was 95% lower than the June quarter rate of 97% and lower than the prior year quarter of 97%.", "Our corrugated segment shipments increased by 8% compared to last year Tacoma contributed the majority of this increase. Excluding these Tacoma tons our shipments increased by 2%. We have been quick to analyze and respond to changes in our customer demand and this quarter was no different.", "In aggregate, we took 36,000 tons of downtime during the quarter most of it from two medium machines at Seminole and West Point. During the quarter, we brought both machines back up and they continue to operate today to meet our solid customer demand.", "At the end of September, our containerboard inventory was 4.6 weeks of consumption, about the same as we carried one year ago. Industry production of containerboard for export markets increased by over 13% from the prior year and increased over 8% on a sequential quarter basis. Rock-Tenn\u2019s export shipments of 319,000 tons in the quarter, increased by 35,000 tons or about 12% sequentially and by 80,000 tons or about 34% over the prior year quarter. We shipped approximately 60% of our export shipments to Latin America, 20% to the Middle East and 10% each to Europe and Asia.", "We had good and stable demand for our export volumes during the quarter. Foreign exchange impacts from the strengthening dollar cause a modest decline in pricing. Currently, overall global demand is strong and pricing has stabilized. The Tacoma Mill continues to perform quite well. EPS accretion during the September quarter was seven times per share.", "Our mill system we\u2019re in very well throughout the quarter. We established new daily production records at Fernandina Beach, Hodge, Hopewell and Battle Creek. We completed construction and started up our new woodyard at Florence mill on time and on budget. The Florence woodyard is currently operating well ahead of its anticipated start-up curve.", "Our Hopewell mill exceeded expected production rates following our mill reconfiguration project completed in the June quarter. The mill has achieved significant energy savings and continues to run at record operating rates, despite a mix shift to (indiscernible).", "We recently completed an end up assessment of our containerboard mill system. And we\u2019ve identified several projects most of which involve capital that will improve the productivity and cost structure of our mill system. These projects represent the opportunity to invest between $250 million and $350 million at paybacks in the range of three to four years.", "One project currently under way, is that our Stevenson Alabama mill where we are investing $46 million to convert to accommodate cost at pulping process, which will improve yield and reduce cost. The new process is expected to start up in June of 2016 and is projected to generate $18 million in annual cost savings from reduced fiber and chemical consumption.", "Turning to our corrugated box operations. Industry box volumes on a per day basis as reported by the Fiber Box Association were essentially flat in the September quarter. Industry box volumes on per shipping day basis increased by 1.5 % in the month of September alone.", "Rock-Tenn\u2019s box volumes for the month of September exceeded our expectations going into the quarter, our volumes increased by 5.2% in total and 0.2% on a per day basis over the last year, we benefited from both solid industry demand and the progress we\u2019re making on our commercial and operational excellence initiatives.", "Our focus on operational excellence continues to bear fruit. Throughout fiscal year 2014 our box plant co-workers supported by the six segment methodology and capital investment have improved efficiency across our box plant system. Flexo folder gluer productivity improved by 12%, die cutter productivity improved by 7% we reduced rate by 5%.", "We\u2019re focused on sustaining and increasing these productivity improvements going forward. During the September quarter, we successfully installed two new EVOL flexo folder gluers and in Austin, Pennsylvania and Chesterfield Missouri box plants this brings the total installed this year to seven. These investments are greatly enhancing the capabilities and productivity of our box plant system.", "An example at our Humboldt Tennessee plant, earlier this year we upgraded the plant by installing both the EVOL and rotary die cutters. The installation of this equipment allowed us to remove four existing flexo folder gluers and two die cutters resulting in significant productivity improvement. Compared to March of this year Humboldt\u2019s production per man-hour has improved by 60%. We reduced waives by about 1% from the levels we experienced in the fiscal year 2013 and we have one made at the warehouse. The equipment waste and (indiscernible) machine and warehouse supported further cost savings.", "During the next three years, we expect to install the remaining 23 EVOLs out of the 30 unit order we placed about one year ago. The net financial result of the volume in customer growth activities in the quarter with an increase in corrugated packaging segment sales to $1.83 billion, corrugated packaging segment EBITDA margin for the September quarter was 20.8% flat with the prior year and up 3,040 basis point sequentially.", "The combination of our focus on commercial excellence operational excellence and focus capital investment is driving noticeable improvement and positive momentum to our results. Our average day box shipments for October increased by 2.4% as compared to last year. We are experiencing good demand with both existing and new customers.", "Turning to our consumer Packaging, we see SBS markets is well balanced. SBS industry backlogs as of October 22 stand at 554,000 tons; Rock-Tenn\u2019s backlogs are at five weeks. Sale re-demand is stable and industry backlogs stood at a 130,000 tons on October 22. Rock-Tenn\u2019s CRB backlogs now stand at approximately two weeks.", "On October 24 we announced the permanent closure of our 55,000 ton uncoated recycled paperboard mill in Cincinnati. Final production will wrap up by the end of the calendar year.", "In our Consumer Packaging segment, total sales were up 6% and segment EBITDA was up $6 million both over the prior year quarter. EBITDA margins were 18%.", "Our folding cartons sales were up 5.4% as compared to the prior year, while the industry was up 1.2%. For the last 12 months our folding cartons sales outpaced the industry with a growth of 2.8% versus 1.2% for the industry.", "Our operational excellence initiatives continued to pay dividends in our folding cartons operations. We installed a new flux at our Nicholasville Folding Carton Plant in June and are already setting production records there. Later this month, we\u2019re installing a press in our Knoxville folding carton plant that is supported by a long-term customer commitment. We expect productivity improvements in Knoxville, somewhere to what we\u2019ve experienced in Nicholasville. And we recently ordered new products for (indiscernible), Iowa plant, also supported by long-term customer commitments.", "Folding carton sales continued to be strong in October. We started an all-time monthly sales record, the sales that were up 5.4% over the previous October.", "Merchandising Displays achieved record sales of $229 million in the quarter, up 24% over the last year. About half of the growth was organic and about half this from acquisitions. In late August we completed the acquisition of A.G. Industries from American Greetings. This acquisition more than doubles our permanent display business and includes a long-term contract with American Greetings.", "The acquisition was accretive in its first month of operation. Last quarter, we said that we expected slightly lower sales and to maintain margins in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter. Our sales increased due to the acquisition of AG Industries and also due to the on-boarding of several new clients sooner than we expected. While this is positive news to accommodate the increased amount and the expedited nature of the new business, we incurred cost that negatively affected our margins for the quarter.", "We anticipate that some of these growing pains will continue through the December quarter of fiscal year 2015 then normalized and we expect to see EBITDA margins in the 10% to 12% range later in the fiscal year. Rock-Tenn operates one of the largest promotional display businesses in the world. Our scale enables us to maintain an efficient cost structuring that provides us the resources to invest in creativity and innovation. The most recent Shopper Marketing Expo Rock-Tenn captured 27 Design of The Times Awards more than twice the number of awards of any other company.", "The judging panel included over 60 executives from major consumer products companies and retailers. Rock-Tenn\u2019s combined packaging solutions offering of merchandizing displays, corrugated boxes and folding cartons is gaining traction and makes us uniquely positioned to help customers win in the marketplace by supporting their efforts to increase sales and reduce cost. Our Recycling Segment volumes were approximately 12% lower than last year. This was due primarily to the previous closures of underperforming recycling plants and the generally soft global recovered fiber markets. Segment EBITDA margins were up by 80 basis points as compared to last year\u2019s quarter. We continue to right size our Recycling business by optimizing the plant footprint and administrative functions.", "I\u2019ll now turn over to Ward, who will discuss various financial aspects of our business. Ward?", "Ward H. Dickson", "Thank you, Steve. While we realized slightly lower price and mix in the quarter, we did experienced higher pricing in many key areas such as domestic containerboard, FPFs and folding cartons. Average domestic mill containerboard prices were up by $23.00 per ton as compared to the prior year quarter. Domestic box pricing was flat and export containerboard pricing was down slightly. One of the most significant reasons for the slightly lower pricing mix for the quarter was due to a mix shift within our corrugated segment towards increased export shipments.", "Average selling prices in consumer packaging were up nicely. Recycled fiber selling prices were down. We experienced approximately $26 million or about a $0.11 per share in cost inflation during the quarter as compared to last year. Energy prices were up significantly, primarily due to a 13% increase in natural gas prices, as reflected in the NYMEX index. We experienced tighten inflationary pressures on freight, chemical and wood cost. Recycled fiber prices were down approximately 20% year-over-year.", "We continue to gain momentum in our cost savings and productivity improvements and generated $41 million and benefits during the quarter over the prior year. Core activities are in areas such as procurement and Six Sigma projects. The majority of which improved operating efficiency, reliability and quality at our manufacturing locations, as well as the impact of capital projects that reduced cost and allow us to better serve our customers. If you take a moment to think about what our segment income bridge will look like for the full year, it has three key components.", "Due to strong containerboard SBS and converting pricing, sales price and mixed gains were $276 million. Inflationary headwinds totaled $228 million and began to moderate in the fourth quarter. Our productivity gains of $108 million were within our guidance range and we had very good momentum in these efforts as we exited the year. Based on what we see at this time, we believe that inflation will not be as significant and impact on our business in fiscal 2015 as last year and we expect our productivity improvements should offset anticipated inflation.", "During the quarter, we generated free cash flow of $261 million or $1.80 per share. Over the last 12 months we have generated free cash flow of $6.10 per share. Our biggest use of cash, during the quarter was $162 million for the repurchase of Rock-Tenn stock. At the end of September, our net debt was approximately $2.95 billion. Our LTM credit agreement EBITDA was over $1.57 billion, and our credit agreement debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.92 times. We have more than $1.5 billion in liquidity available to us for general corporate purposes.", "We extended the maturity of our $700 million accounts receivable securitization facility from December of 2015 until October of 2017. Other than some amortization under our bank term loan facility, we have no debt facilities maturing until fiscal 2017, one of our bank credit facility matures. We expect to extend the maturity of our bank credit facility well in advance of the maturity date.", "Let me highlight some key assumptions for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Our effective tax rate for the September quarter of 35.6% was in line with our expectations. We expect that tax rate for the first quarter and the full fiscal year of between 34% and 36%, excluding the impact of any discrete items.", "At September 30, we had used almost all of our U.S. federal and foreign net operating losses. We still have approximately $57 million of various state net operating losses and credits available for use in future years.", "We also have significant remaining U.S. federal cellulosic biofuel, Alternative Minimum Tax and other federal tax credits that can be used to offset a total of $228 million of U.S. cash taxes, which we expect to use during fiscal years 2015 and 2016.", "Based on current assumptions, we estimate our cash taxes at approximately a mid-teens percent during fiscal 2015 and mid-20s percent during the fiscal 2016. We have completed our year-end pension work with our actuaries and as expected the pension plans of beneficiaries of this year\u2019s transportation bill.", "Our estimated cash contributions into our U.S. and Canadian pension plans in fiscal 2015 are approximately $160 million, estimated pension expenses $10 million, excluding the expected impact of the lump sum settlement, for a net contribution in excess of expense of $150 million.", "We expect the fiscal years of 2016, 2017 and 2018 cash pension contributions will be approximately $160 million, $135 million and $90 million respectively. We recently completed the first phase of a pension lump sum offering to former employees approximately 5,000 former employees or 54% of those receiving an election pocket accepted the pension lump sum by our \u2013 or annuity offer, which was paid from pension assets, approximately $249 million in liabilities were permanently removed from our pensions.", "The $48 million pretax non-cash charge equivalent to $0.20 per share represents the portion of deferred pension, actuarial losses recorded in the shareholders equity section of our balance sheet. And accumulated other comprehensive loss and now has to be recognized under GAAP accounting into the income statement as a result of a lump sum settlement.", "We\u2019re closing on the second lump sum program this quarter and we expect to remove another approximately a $170 million in liabilities and an additional 6,000 participants from our pension rolls. Our qualified pension plans unfunded liability was approximately $1.1 billion, an increase of only $114 million from September 30, 2013 to September 30, 2014. Discount rates used in valuing the pension obligations of U.S. and Canadian plans declined 65 basis points and 56 basis points respectively as compared to last year.", "The impact of the lower discount rates contributed $327 million to higher pension liabilities and the adoption of new mortality assumptions added almost a $100 million of liabilities. Service cost and interest cost also impacted the liability negatively, this was partially offset by very strong asset performance in both the U.S. and Canadian pension plans both of which exceeded our expected return on assets set at the beginning of the year.", "As an update to our CapEx guidance we expect that our 2015 capital expenditures will be in range of $500 million to $550 million. In July, we estimated our fiscal 2015 CapEx at $500 million, but as we closed the year we had a number of high return generating (no) capital projects that Steve discussed earlier to which we expect to allocate capital, which may result in increased investment to the higher end of the range. We\u2019re planning major scheduled maintenance downtime of 294,000 tons during the fiscal 2015 as compared to 262,000 tons in fiscal 2014. All of that maintenance related downtime is scheduled to occur between now and late spring.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Steve, who will discuss our business and the outlook.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Thanks Ward. Rock-Tenn is focused on customers, productivity and improving our business and in capital investment and acquisitions. Over the past year, we started offering many customers and integrated offering displays, cartons and boxes. All of the objective to be the clear partner and (inaudible) provider of winning solutions for our customers. Well this is a long-term endeavor. We\u2019re seeing new business as a result of being able to provide our customers in immigrated offering.", "Moving to productivity, we achieved over $100 million in productivity improvement last year, including of our $40 million in the September quarter. We\u2019ve had a sustained focus on continuous improvement during my entire carrier at Rock-Tenn. Continuous improvement as expected, reinforced and rewarded throughout Rock-Tenn. Over the past several years, we\u2019ve achieved an excess of $100 million annually, through our embedded Six Sigma, Procurement and Home Office programs.", "We have significant opportunity to improve our performance with capital investment in our box plant system, the most prominent investments being in the converting equipment in our box plants. And we\u2019ve now identified more opportunity in our mill system. Our supply chain or logistics costs are an excess of $1 billion per year and I see the opportunity for improvement in this area as we better integrate our supply planning with our transportation warehouse system.", "The aggregation of these opportunities gives me the confidence to set our fiscal year 2016, through fiscal year 2018 productivity improvement target at $200 million each year. This will require continued capital investment in the range of $500 million to $550 million for the next three years.", "In 2014 we invested approximately $260 million in our corrugated mills, $135 million in our box plant system and $110 million in total and our consumer packaging and merchandising displays business. The balance was invested in the recycling business and towards various corporate projects including financial systems, infrastructure, and security.", "Fiscal years 2015 through 2018 we expect capital expenditures to be allocated in a similar matter with more than half in our mill system. Our capital allocation priorities remain to first focus on the opportunities in our businesses then on acquisition to make us a better business, then use share buybacks to return capital to our shareholders within our two times leverage target.", "Our fiscal year 2014 results reflect these priorities and I expect to maintain this construct in fiscal year 2015 and beyond. We are investing the time and resources to evaluate the merits of a master limited partnership structure for virgin mill assets and view the master limited partnership opportunity as a way to access lower cost equity capital for our business.", "We\u2019ve spent conservable time to understand the complexities of the structure as it relates for our operations and how we do business. We have recently filed our private letter ruling request with the Internal Revenue Service. We are evaluating the specific merits of the potential MLP pieces structure as would apply to Rock-Tenn, their lawyers, tax advisors and bankers. I continue to be optimistic about the opportunity.", "Turning to the outlook for the quarter, corrugated box, folding carton, and display markets have been very strong in October. The November and December can be uncertain as we head into the holiday season. We will be watching these trends carefully over the next two months. As of the end of October, supply and demands balanced at our containerboard mills. Containerboard and box pricing is stable. As new containerboard capacity begins production, we will monitor our demand for containerboard through our box plant system from domestic customers and from export customers. We will continue to match our supply to meet market demand.", "We see a fairly benign overall cost environment for our fiscal first quarter. We expect to see only modest seasonal increases towards cost during the quarter and recovered fiber cost will remain soft through the rest of the calendar year. Oil and natural gas cost are helpful right now as five natural gas prices are less than $4 per MMBtu and oil is about $80 per barrel. We\u2019re planning on 75,000 tons of maintenance related downtime this quarter. We expect inventory levels within our corrugated business to increase by approximately 75,000 tons in the second quarter fiscal 2015 and then reduce to current levels by the end of fiscal year 2015. We will continue to maintain inventory levels to support our business and our customer needs.", "My current views at our adjusted EPS range for the first fiscal quarter will between $0.80 and $0.90 per share. I continue to remain confident in the Rock-Tenn\u2019s ability to provide our shareholders the strong current cash flow returns and also with our ability to improve these returns by deploying our free cash flow to further developing our strategy and also by returning this capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.", "Ward, Jim, Mike, and I are now available to respond to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instruction) The first question today is from Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research Group.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research Group", "Thank you, two questions. First is quickly on the operational productivity. You outlined targets of $200 million starting fiscal year 2016 and beyond you got just over $100 million this year. How should we think of fiscal 2015, I know you\u2019ve mentioned it should off that inflation, but could you help us quite a bit by what type of targets you might have for 2015?", "Ward H. Dickson", "Yeah, we see that as we move (indiscernible) we see as we move from fiscal 2014 toward that target that we will start to claim in a linear path. So we will, as we go into FY 2015 we will start to get some of the benefits from the capital investments that we made both in our mill and converting operations, we will continue to focus on productivity improvements coming out of our Six Sigma efforts and continued cost reductions from the procurement organization. So we do see it in our range that will put as on a path towards the $200 million.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research Group", "Okay. So more than the $100, so most likely in the 130 to 160 type range, is that a reasonable framework.", "Ward H. Dickson", "I think if can put a range on, it would be 125 to 150.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research Group", "Okay, great. And then second \u2013 on the MLP private letter that you filed, can you provide us either with any details of which what might have been in that private letter request and also do you have any sense as to when or if on the more tour it might you lifted such that RS would have respond to you.", "Ward H. Dickson", "We are not in a position to, want to describe the details. What we requested and we\u2019ve really don\u2019t have much inside into the timing that it would be processed.", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research Group", "Okay.", "Ward H. Dickson", "So, I am sorry I can help you more, but that\u2019s what the answer is.", "", "Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research Group", "", "Sure. Thank you.", "", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from George Staphos with Bank of America.", "George L. Staphos \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "", "Hi, guys. Good morning, thanks for all the details. It perhaps you want be able to answer this question kind of figure that, what market getting. Do you see the potential to you is not only your virgin containerboard mills in an MLP structure but could it also include from your advantage point some of your other assets and virgin to fiber conversion?", "Ward H. Dickson", "", "Yeah. We are not in a position to answer that one either.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Okay. I thought I would try those too. Thank you. In terms of the productivity ramp up, over the next year, do you \u2013 you call that several things and again we appreciate the direction, would it be a heaviest to any one of that three or four buckets you called out, would it be heavier to procurement, would it be heavier to the return you are getting on the conversion investment and corrugated where would we see as we have that visibility the most progress.", "Ward H. Dickson", "Just we\u2019ve been on pretty consumption in the healthy $100 million plus range with the continuous improvement programs we had in place. So now I think we\u2019re seeing the opportunity through capital investment in the mills, in the box plans, and also supply chain, supply chain wouldn\u2019t come from capital investment, but we\u2019re operating at just much better in supply chain than we ever have certainly something smart for acquisition and the timing, it\u2019s pretty well distributed among those categories and you almost have to get into the timing of the capital with the timing of the productivity improvements to provide very much more detail on that.", "George L. Staphos \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "Ward H. Dickson", "Our capital on the box plant system is ahead of our capital on the mill system, so I think near term you\u2019d expect more in the box plants than the mills, but then mills will catch up in a year or two.", "George L. Staphos \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "", "Ward H. Dickson", "As we always starting with the Florence woodyard this year and then going to the Stevenson project and beyond.", "George L. Staphos \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "All right. Thanks Steven I had my two alternate over.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc.", "Adam J. Josephson \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Thanks, good morning everyone, and congratulations on a really solid quarter. Steve you\u2019ve mentioned that overall global demand for exports is strong and the pricing has stabilized steadily. Given that global economies a period of weak enough late. Can you try to explain, give any thoughts just still why you\u2019ve experienced this recent strength after you experience some being export price declines earlier in the quarter.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Adam, Jim\u2019s closest to markets and I\u2019ll ask Jim Porter to respond.", "Adam J. Josephson \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Thank you.", "James B. Porter III", "Good morning, Adam.", "Adam J. Josephson \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Good morning, Jim.", "James B. Porter III", "Global softening I don\u2019t know that I can necessarily comment on that necessarily. We\u2019d certainly seen some currency movement relative to the dollar, but our customer portfolio globally is strong. We work very hard to try to build a diverse customer relationship really in all parts of the world and we see in the principally agricultural markets very solid demand. And so this has been a strategy for us to try to strengthen our both our domestic and international sales and we think we\u2019ve got a very strong customer base and hence demand.", "Adam J. Josephson \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "And Jim what on the domestic market, you\u2019ve been in terms of the U.S. box market, you\u2019ve been losing share in recent quarters, but you could have gain share in the month of September and obviously October is quite good too. And did you do expect this to continue, do you expect to gain share in the months and quarters to comp based on recent organizational changes you\u2019ve made or what thoughts do you have along those lines. Thank you?", "Ward H. Dickson", "So, Adam, let me ask Mike Kiepura to answer that one\u2026", "Michael E. Kiepura", "Adam, I would say that we\u2019re seeing momentum picking up after we bought Smurfit-Stone, we closed 21 box plants and we went through the inefficiencies in closing those plants and the movement of accounts and so forth and that\u2019s pretty well behind us. And so I think the things that we\u2019re doing from both the commercial and operational standpoint coupled with the change we made about six months to go to bring more of an enterprise wide solution set to our customers of both boxes and folding cartons and displays is gathering some nice momentum in the market.", "So we\u2019re optimistic that as we saw late August, September and into October that we\u2019re seeing positive comparisons year-over-year and that will continue going forward.", "Adam J. Josephson \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.,", "", "Thanks a lot, Mike.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Scott Gaffner with Barclays.", "Scott L. Gaffner \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Good morning.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Good morning, Scott.", "Scott L. Gaffner \u2013 Barclays Capital", "I just wanted to look at the shipments for a minute. Because I guess I\u2019m a little confused I thought especially within Corrugated Packaging, I thought during the quarter you talked about shipments possibly being down 3% to 4% year-over-year and if I heard you correctly, I think you said you\u2019re up 0.2% per day. It was helping maybe if you could sort of add a little bit of color there at the difference in the numbers?", "Ward H. Dickson", "Sure, I did said a 3% to 4% I think in early September, turned out our September shipments were in excess of our expectations, 0.2% is for the September month only I think for the quarter we were down 2.5%.", "Scott L. Gaffner \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay.", "Ward H. Dickson", "So, which is better that I thought and actually about the same as we thought going into the quarter, but the shipments in July and August weren\u2019t quite as great as we thought in September we made a lot of ground woods ended up being the same level that we thought going into the quarter.", "Scott L. Gaffner \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. And then, taking that one step further then I think you said October was up 2.4% year-over-year, are you seeing some increasing demand in certain regions or certain areas of your business that are starting to inflect positively that led to that improvement in September and continued gains in October?", "Ward H. Dickson", "There are variations from segment-to-segment, some segments like e-commerce and process goods for us our stronger produce we\u2019re in a seasonally softer period of time in the fiscal fourth quarter. So we were little bit softer and then of course we have the West Coast and the drought in the western part of the country that hurts there as well. Beverage is clearly soft and I think that\u2019s was documented in the industry.", "So, some of those segments are up somewhere down but, I think we\u2019re also experiencing good progress with both our existing customers and the on-boarding of new business with existing customers and new customers. So, as I mentioned before, our commercial efforts are bearing fruit to generate the positive momentum going forward.", "Scott L. Gaffner \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.", "Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citigroup Inc.", "Good morning.", "Ward H. Dickson", "Good morning Anthony.", "Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citigroup Inc.", "In your outlook slide you referenced potential acquisition interest in packaging adjacencies, I was wondering is that a reference to other substrates other than containerboard and boxboard. I think AGI has some exposure whether it\u2019s plastic or metal. What are the packaging adjacencies that you were referring to? And are there attractive opportunities outside those containerboard and boxboard?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I think there are opportunities for us outside of containerboard and boxboard. I think the packaging adjacency as you named several of them. Like we would look acquisitions for how they fit within our business. I think if we were outside of what we do, I think, we\u2019d start looking at both the \u2013 whether there\u2019s any common operational synergies associated with that, or whether there\u2019s customer synergies. And so, for example, A.G. Industries does the plaster can work and that was a perfect fit with our permanent supply business. And further it supports our development strategy to sort of customers to help them be successful.", "Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citigroup Inc.", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just circling back to those September and October box shipments, it seemed to little bit stronger than you had original expected, would you attribute that primarily to the integrated offering that you\u2019ve been able to provide with your reorganization, or is it really more driven just by improved underlying demand from customers?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I don\u2019t know what box demand in our cover was for the industry. And so it\u2019s hard for me to identify how much of that would be industry. Our business we need transforming operations, we need strong commercial scales, and I feel like they are instructively intertwined with one another. And I think we have good momentum in both of those areas. And I think the integrated offering gives us something else that we can talk about our customers.", "So I\u2019d identify all three of those, I would \u2013 so if I had to focus on one, it would be the operational improvement that we have really across our converting plant systems to what we\u2019ve make substantial progress just over the past one, two, three years on that improvement that paid dividends, because you can do a better job with certainly your customers with that operational capability.", "Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citigroup Inc.", "Okay, I\u2019ll turn it over.", "Operator", "Thank you. So next question is from Mark Wilde of Bank of Montreal.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 BMO Capital Markets Corp.", "Good morning Steve, good morning Ward.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Hello Mark.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 BMO Capital Markets Corp.", "I have just two questions. One Steve do you have a good quarter in terms of margins in containerboard and corrugated, but you still got that gap to the peers which it\u2019s your still probably anywhere from 250 bps to 500 bps. Can you talk about closing that gap over the next I don\u2019t know three to four years? Is there any reason you shouldn\u2019t be ride on the peers in terms of margins.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Well, we don\u2019t know where we are, and I think our competitors were strong competitors and that would continue to improve. I think we\u2019re very capable, and I think we\u2019ve mapped out I think I relatively clarifying about what we can do to improve our productivity and (indiscernible) have that compares to what other people will do. I can\u2019t, it\u2019s kind of difficult for me to comment on. I think the capability we have is very strong and I think we can continue to show improvement and it\u2019s kind of hard for me to say when we will close the gap, what I can do is, I can try to make as margin for Rock-Tenn as we\u2019re capable of doing that, and it\u2019s a competitive business, so\u2026", "Mark Wilde \u2013 BMO Capital Markets Corp.", "Yeah, I guess there is as structurally is there anything. Just when I look at like mill cost models from some of the consultants it looks like \u2013 you\u2019re in ride in the pack there.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "It\u2019s a fact of picking area to where I think we could improve that would be supply chain.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 BMO Capital Markets Corp.", "Okay.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Like you do math out or what we spend a very large amount of money on trade, and so one of the reasons I pointed that out in comments as, that\u2019s something which I\u2019ve think as a rich opportunity for us and we\u2019re getting a much better handle on them we ever have.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 BMO Capital Markets Corp.", "Okay. The other question I had Steve you just mentioned the potential for acquisitions and you\u2019ve mentioned both domestic and offshore. And I just wondered if you were in a look of offshore do you have buyers to either going into emerging markets where there may be more over time versus finding an opportunity in a more developed market.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I tend to look at to the ones of customers and we have a large number of customers in Latin and Central America which by our containerboard product. So if there were an opportunity to call integrate forward in those areas that would be a opportunity for us. I think the other area that comes up is Europe and I think something in Europe would be driven more by the needs of consumer proximate needs which would be \u2013 have global purchasing organizations which are located in Europe.", "We don\u2019t have a strong, I guess, bias or interest in Asia. So probably are going to pick areas that would be South America, Central America and Europe, but all of those would have to pass a hurdle setting with our existing business structure.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 BMO Capital Markets Corp.", "Okay, that\u2019s really helpful, good luck in coming quarter and the coming year, Steve.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Thanks Mark.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Thank you, good morning, guys.", "", "Ward H. Dickson", "", "Hi, Alex.", "Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Great quarter. Just to come back on the MLP topic, hypothetically if you were to get a favorable ruling from the IRS, have you done enough work now where, if you are comfortable with how the operational structure would look in MLP scenario to move down that path if you were to get a favorable ruling.", "Ward H. Dickson", "", "So we have spend a lot of time and effort over the last three to five months on this topic. And I would say our efforts to-date have been around two areas, one, preparing for the private letter ruling request. And then two, doing the feasibility analysis of the potential MLP structure. And in that is the initial value creation opportunity and then we also have looked at the structural, operational and governance issues that would come with the MLP structure with inside of Rock-Tenn. And I think what I would say is I would reiterate what Steve said in his comments is that we are optimistic about the opportunity. I think at the conference that Steve presented too early and in the quarter he said that we\u2019re not intimidated by complexity.", "So we still have more work to do with our tax and financial advisors to ensure that there is the value creation opportunity, but we do think it wants additional time, effort and resources on the topic.", "Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay, got you, but that\u2019s very helpful. And then Steve, you mentioned $1 billion of supply chain costs which were focused on continuing to optimize. In the context of the sharp correction, Brent and WTI, where the prices can you talk about what the potential direct impact could be just from the correction in energy prices recently?", "", "Steven C. Voorhees", "The direct impact would be the impact on diesel prices which flows through pretty promptly in freight rates through the filled fuel surcharge which is declined based on what the Energy Information Administration publishes as price changed.", "Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Got it. Steve and then let me \u2013 how much of the billion doors would just be that cost of diesel?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "We\u2019ve got a table and in the presentation I just point toward that.", "Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. Very good, thank you very much.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank. The next question is from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.", "Christopher D. Manuel \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Good morning gentleman. Congratulations on a strong finish to the year.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Thanks, Chris.", "Christopher D. Manuel \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "For fiscally, I would say. Two questions, I want to ask. The first was I noticed \u2013 or may I\u2019ve missed it but if I knows the (inaudible) for cash flow guidance usually you do that for the out year. Would there be any reason as we try to talk to some of the components for what 2015 for cash flow versus 2014 would look like. Appreciating some of the difference for book versus cash tax that\u2019s stepping up but in some of your productivity initiatives than other things and less inflation of vis-\u00e0-vis productivity this year, is there any reason you weren\u2019t at least have another 6.10 per share or more of free cash flow in 2015 versus 2014.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "We just decided that we are not going to give the free cash flow guidance. I think as we looked at it, it seem to confuse people more than help people, I think you\u2019ve identified tax and also pointed towards pension as (inaudible) which will be changing and I think I would point out productivity and pointed out the pieces on raw materials to the extent that we can. But I expect we are going to generate continued free cash flow, strong free cash flow for some time to come.", "Christopher D. Manuel \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. With respect to kind of you box shipment levels through most of 2014 of fiscal 2014 you were a bit behind industry level. Looking at I think you\u2019ve mentioned in October you are up almost 2.5%. Do you think that as you work through your fiscal 2015 that you ought to be back to a level at add or near industry levels and maybe what would be some of the puts and takes that would make you better and make you worst as you think on a go forward basis?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I think that we are clearly seeing momentum, as we head into and start our new fiscal year and the commercial and operational improvements help to make us I think more competitive in the marketplace. So that we\u2019re optimistic about how we\u2019ll compare relative to 2014 into the industry, but in terms of trying to project specifically what that will be we\u2019re not going to do that, but I think combined with, as I mentioned, the approach that we\u2019re taking to differentiate ourselves from the marketplace and bring innovation to the marketplace is bearing fruit relative to growth with existing customers and with new customers and the cost efficiencies in the improvements that things like the levels that we\u2019re installing in our box plant system in terms of helping us on our quality, our cost, our on-time delivery. I think most all the indicators are pointing in the upward direction to say it would be a positive year-over-year comparison for us.", "Christopher D. Manuel \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank.", "Debbie Jones \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hi, good morning.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Good morning, Debbie.", "Debbie Jones \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "I was hoping if you could comment on the Tacoma acquisition and the integration appears to be going pretty well. I recognize there is seasonality, but would you consider the contribution for the quarter as you said run rate going forward or do you see more benefits that you could gain over the next 6 to 12 months?", "James B. Porter III", "This is Jim. We\u2019re just really delighted with the Tacoma acquisition and the operating team, sales team, our customer interactions, supply chain, et cetera is all just working together better than planned. So we\u2019re quite pleased with the progress that\u2019s been made there. And yes there are improvements yet to come. We\u2019ve still got further integration to the portfolio of products that the mix of how we supply those to our customer base and further improvements in our supply chain before we start to think about the implementation of some of our capital and further just execution issues. So we think there is a bright side ahead.", "Debbie Jones \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And I guess my follow-up question just on the exports and how is that\u2019s \u2013 it haven\u2019t that coming in as a percentage of your mix versus your expectation and then have you seen any incremental pricing pressure over the last 30 to 60 days on exports as we\u2019ve kind seen the dollar strengthening here?", "James B. Porter III", "Relative to our expectations, we\u2019re really ride on the plan that we would have anticipated with of course the flexibility that we never quite know what demand is going to be, but as we look at our channel mix between our internal plants, our domestic customers, and our international business would we really will ride out where we thought we might be. And as I said earlier, where it\u2019s hard to try to build a very diverse portfolio of customer both in the U.S. and internationally and we\u2019re quite pleased with how that is operating today. Relative to pricing, you\u2019re right there is currency pressure due to euro, but we\u2019ve also seen energy prices go down, so freight is somewhat of an offset. So there is pluses and minuses as relative to price, but overall (indiscernible) are both reasonably solid.", "Debbie Jones \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thanks. That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll pass it on.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Philip Ng with Jefferies.", "Philip Ng \u2013 Jefferies", "Hi, good morning guys. I guess what the POR filing you guys have informed that front. How should we\u2019ve been thinking about the cash process, if you guys do move forward of MLP, are you going to be looking at M&A little differently at least on the valuation front?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I think it\u2019s little bit early for us to applying on that.", "Philip Ng \u2013 Jefferies", "Okay.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "There is just a long way to go before all that comes together.", "Philip Ng \u2013 Jefferies", "Okay, that\u2019s fine. And then, we think about demand for 2015 encouraging to see good we mentioned both on export side and domestically, but how should we be thinking about on the pluses and minuses? Demand in there it should benefit from lower gasoline prices, but what about this potential impact or dimensional way changes by FedEx and EPS of the world?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Just I think you\u2019re on the position for what apply to be in the box and carton business, but the customers want lower cost and get the lower cost by through design and just using box fiber for the same application. In the meantime our products are fantastic products in the marketplace and they do use of products retired primarily to non-durable goods and population drives that, and I think what you talked about we\u2019ve seen the slope of what you\u2019re saying of when oil prices go up, demand goes down. And so what you\u2019re saying about well may be lower oil prices put more money in people\u2019s pocketbooks and they can buy more products boxes and is there. I\u2019d take some comfort in enquires and industry box demand in September and I\u2019ll be watching carefully to that cover number and what happens to the holiday season.", "Philip Ng \u2013 Jefferies", "Okay, but generally it sounds like you guys a little more update on demand outlook and then some of the commercial initiatives you\u2019ve made have been providing bearing some fruit?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "The current economic environment (indiscernible) September is encouraging certainly our results in October are encouraging as well.", "Philip Ng \u2013 Jefferies", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Al Kabili with Macquarie.", "Albert Kabili \u2013 Macquarie", "All right, thanks. Good morning. I guess question for Jim is on the productivity spending and opportunity there. If you could just help us size up what the implications are for your mill capacity over the next four years? How much of that $200 million in productivity savings and 2016 through 2018 is just be a more mill capacity versus various cost savings?", "James B. Porter III", "Our focus is not capacity addition. We were very keen on manufacturing exactly the right products for our customer base and delighting them every day, trying to make investments, and how we operate and how our capital structure is laid out to reduce cost and improve efficiency, but there is \u2013 there is none of that $200 million that is a capacity or share enhancing investment.", "Albert Kabili \u2013 Macquarie", "Okay, I appreciate that Jim. And then next question I had I guess to Steve on the integrated offering. Can you just size up for us where we are as far as penetration of that and kind of how quickly you know you see that moving up and as this \u2013can this really move the needle as far as your volume and performance going forward and what\u2019s the advantage for the (indiscernible) compelling advantage for the customer there? Thanks.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Al, Mike is closes to that, so I\u2019m going to let Mike respond to that.", "Michael E. Kiepura", "I think that it\u2019s we\u2019re making good progress. We\u2019ve only been organized this way for the past six months or so. So there is some effort that\u2019s getting organized, still work to do on refining our innovation platform and what we can bring to the customers. And then you have to keep in mind that the sale process, typically on the folding carton or display side, it\u2019s a longer sale process. Major customers have contracts that are typically on the order of three years.", "So that\u2019s going to effect the rate at which we can penetrate. But I would say at this point we\u2019re very encouraged by the signals and the response that we\u2019re getting in terms of new business that we\u2019ve sold that we\u2019ve begun to on board into our network of plants across the company. So we think that focusing our strategy on driving for differentiation through innovation and a wider fiber based solution offering to our customers is being well received and we think we\u2019ll continue to be well received as we continue to refine our process for doing so.", "Albert Kabili \u2013 Macquarie", "", "Okay, alright, thank you I appreciate it and me also looking the upcoming fiscal year here.", "Michael E. Kiepura", "Thanks Tom.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. The next question is from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partner.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research", "", "Hi, good morning. Steve you had mentioned in the beginning that you saw, I believe you said $250 million to $300 million in projects that had three to four year paybacks and you mentioned Stevenson? I just wanted to make sure, I heard that those were not separate projects like each one was out large but that\u2019s a total and could you give us some examples or of either other projects like Stevenson or the timeframe over which these expenditures will take place?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "", "Stevenson is one of those projects and we have a number of other projects that go into the $250 to $350 volume which would be of our multiyear period of time. I\u2019m not sure we ready to example, I\u2019ll give Jim Porter an opportunity to provide examples.", "James B. Porter III", "", "Yeah, we don\u2019t have a list that we prepared to share, but in operating our mills, there is just a \u2013 almost an unlimited runway of investment opportunities to reduce energy cost to improve efficiency, to improve our chemical consumption processes and we\u2019ve had enough time to really get into the (weeds) of understanding the maintenance CapEx as well as the business improvement capital projects and we\u2019ve gone through that comprehensive asset review and come up with some really exciting things that we\u2019re prepared to tackle. So beyond that I don\u2019t know that we could share anymore granularity.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research", "", "But I guess it\u2019s fair to say that\u2019s the total and that\u2019s probably over several years, not just in 2015 that you will be speaking about\u2026", "Steven C. Voorhees", "", "Yes, exactly. Yes and I tried to speak about by putting capital guidance out there for the next several years. So it is within the $500 to $550 that we described during the time out.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research", "", "Yep, which is very helpful and just one last quick one. If Jim could you talk a little bit about the export market in the sense that I know that I believe that most of the virgin board, line to board, you send overseas is in agricultural type uses. If you could clarify that and tell us if the \u2013 the end customers are at the box level overseas are changing in any way over time?", "James B. Porter III", "Changing over time? No, I really would not say that. I \u2013 and you\u2019re right. The virgin containerboard consume globally is largely focused on the agricultural markets and as those markets and emerging markets consumption grow the demand for virgin containerboard increases. And so, we\u2019ve tried to position ourselves with that customer base around the globe that uses virgin containerboard and we tried to build a supply chain network that is consistent reliable and one in which they can count on. So we\u2019re optimistic that that part of our business will continue to grow over time.", "Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research", "Got you. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from George Staphos with Bank of America. Mr. Staphos, please check your mute button. We\u2019ll move on to the next question. The final question today is from (indiscernible) with Barclays.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, good morning guys. How are you?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "", "Good morning.", "Michael E. Kiepura", "Good morning.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This question sort of comes from the fixed income side, which is my area of expertise and if I may there is a follow up on sort of the MLP discussion. But as you think about the potential and I understand you don\u2019t want to discuss all the outcomes yet, but how do you think about your two times leverage target and just generally the balance sheet in the context of potentially selling assets into an MLP?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I think we still believe that the current leverage targeted model that we\u2019re driving our capital allocation to \u2013 can fit within the MLP structure.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And maybe \u2013 let\u2019s just say that you\u2019re again committed to investment grade that there isn\u2019t an outcome here that you want to be in investment grade regardless of the outcome on the MLP side?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I mean we have said that we are comfortable at both cross-over and investment grade ratings. And we\u2019ve said that we would be \u2013 if we found the right acquisition opportunity, we would be \u2013 we will have a willingness to lever up with the commitment to bring the leverage ratio back down to historical levels. So I think we like the investment grade rating that we have today. It gives us tremendous flexibility.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, that\u2019s great. I appreciate the color guys. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. I show no further questions. I\u2019d like to turn the call over to speakers for closing remarks.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "", "Okay, thanks Wendy and thank you all for joining our call.", "Operator", "Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for joining.

Conference will run for 1 hour and at the end, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.", "At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the RockTenn Second Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, slides are being presented today as part of the conference call. These slides can be accessed at www.rocktenn.com under the Investors page.", "Ladies and gentlemen, this call is being recorded today, April 30. [Operator Instructions] Your speakers for today's call are Mr. Steve Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Ward Dickson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Voorhees, you may begin your conference.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Thank you very much. Welcome to our call. This the Steve Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer, and I'm joined this morning by Ward Dickson, Chief Financial Officer; Jim Porter, President of our Paper Solutions business; and Mike Kiepura, President of our Packaging Solutions business.", "During the course of the call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discuss during the call. We described these risks and uncertainties in our filings with SEC. These include our most recent 10-K for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2014, and 10-Q for the quarter ending December 31, 2014. We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We've provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation. The slide presentation is available on our website.", "I'm going to start by discussing our operating results, and then Ward will discuss our balance sheet, pension and various financial measures. I will complete our prepared remarks with comments on the status of the merger of MWV and the outlook. Then Ward, Jim, Mike and I will be available for your questions.", "The RockTenn team continued to deliver solid operating results in the March quarter. Adjusted earnings of $0.85 per share were 35% higher than last year's adjusted earnings of $0.63 per share. This improvement was driven by strong results in our Corrugated Packaging segment, where segment income increased 28% over last year. This increase was a result of strong external demand in corrugated and solid commercial execution and operational improvement in our mills and box plant system. Additionally, we benefited from lower commodity cost. We were negatively affected by the combination of a substantial electrical failure at our Panama City mill and severe weather in February. These negative factors reduced earnings by $0.09 per share. We've seen our box shipments trend positively over the prior year shipments on a per day basis since the second half of September of 2014. This trend continued during the December and March quarters for both RockTenn and the overall industry. RockTenn's March quarter box shipments increased 5.4% on an equivalent per day basis and actual shipments increased 3.7%, both of these are as compared to the prior year. There was 1 less shipping day in the quarter this year versus last year, and both numbers significantly exceeded the comparable industry numbers. We also saw very good end market demand in our folding carton business, where volumes were up 1.1% compared to the prior-year quarter. Performance in our Merchandising Displays business is not meeting our expectations. Segment income for the quarter was $12 million less than last quarter. I will speak to our Displays segment in more detail later in these prepared remarks.", "Our adjusted EPS of $0.85 is higher than the updated guidance range we provided at the end of March. While I like the fact that our performance exceeded these expectations, I would prefer that we not see this amount of difference between our actual and estimated results, particularly this late in the quarter. We regularly update our forecast each month and, in this circumstance, we faced a series of negative events during February and the first half of March. These negative events included weather impacts to our natural gas service at 4 of our large mills, where service was unexpectedly curtailed; the electrical issue at Panama City; and a discernible decline in demand for promotional displays. The cumulative impact of these events caused us to reduce our expectations, and with those facts, I felt compelled to update our guidance. While we were reducing our expectations, we benefited from a number of positive factors during the last week of March, including strong demand and operational performance in excess of our expectations across all of our businesses, particularly in our mills. The roughly $0.10 difference between our reported results in the top end of the revised guidance range to about 1/3 better mill and plant performance, 1/3 stronger sales and 1/3 forecast conservatism.", "Net sales of $2.5 billion, were 3% higher than last year's March quarter. The Tacoma Mill acquisition, which was completed in May of last year, and the strong box plant performance contributed to the revenue increase. RockTenn's Credit Agreement EBITDA of $1.6 billion for the last 12 months was $66 million or 4% higher than last year's quarter. We generated strong free cash flow of $1.11 per share. We will absolutely maintain our focus on strong free cash flow generation after the merger is complete. We ended the March quarter with leverage of 1.74x, and our balance sheet is in great shape as we get closer to completing our merger with MWV.", "Demand for Corrugated Packaging continued to be solid this quarter, with higher industry production of domestic and export containerboard in this quarter as compared to last year's March quarter. Industry box shipments in the March quarter were also higher than last year's March quarter by 3.4% on a per day basis as reported by the Fiber Box Association. The improved domestic and export containerboard volumes and box shipments resulted in healthy industry containerboard mill operating rates of 95.5% for the quarter.", "Demand for RockTenn's corrugated products was strong, with export and domestic containerboard production improving more than the industry in the March quarter as compared to the prior year quarter. Export demand improved significantly, as our exports shipments of 286,000 tons in the quarter were up 19,000 tons or 7% from the prior year quarter, largely as a result of 3 factors. First, we added new customers. Second, we experienced improved demand in Latin America. And third, we added additional mill export volumes from our Tacoma Mill. Sequentially, export containerboard volumes increased by 10,000 tons or about 4%. As compared to the December quarter of this fiscal year, export containerboard pricing was slightly lower by about $5 per ton as a result of changes in mix and the strengthening dollar. Our regional export mix was similar to last quarter, with approximately 60% of our export shipments to Latin America, 20% to the Middle East and 10% each to Europe and Asia. RockTenn's box shipments also surpassed the industry's year-over-year improvement. Starting in mid-September 2014, we began to see our box shipments trend positively over the prior year shipments on a per day basis. The increased box shipments were due to healthy industry box demand as well as the progress that we've been making in our product quality, service and improving the customer experience. Box demand continued to strengthen in the March quarter. Our growth exceeded industry box demand, with our box shipments improving by 5.4% on a per day basis compared to last year's March quarter. There was no benefit from the Tacoma Mill acquisition on these strong box numbers, as the Tacoma Mill operated no box plants.", "RockTenn's Corrugated segment mill operating rate for the quarter was 92.6%. If we exclude the 80,000 tons of maintenance downtime we took during the quarter, our operating rate was 96.5%. Our April box volumes are also very strong month-to-date, as they are up over 4% on a per day basis as compared to last year. Both Aprils have the same number of shipping days.", "Containerboard and box trends are reflected in our financial results for the quarter. Corrugated Packaging segment sales of $1.73 billion, increased from $1.65 billion in the prior year March quarter, an increase of 5%. Corrugated Packaging segment EBITDA margin for the March quarter was 17.3%, this is up 210 basis points from the prior year quarter. Our focus on operational improvements continues to drive positive results. Corrugated productivity improved by 1% over the March quarter of 2014. The benefits of the EVOL installations have driven flexo folder gluer performance to record levels. For the quarter, flexo folder gluer's performance increased 19% as compared to the prior-year quarter and was up 6% sequentially. Die cutter productivity also set a record with 5% improvement over the March quarter of 2014. Additionally, our container plant labor efficiency, as measured by square feet produced per labor hour, increased by 3% over last year.", "During the March quarter, we continued to execute our long-term EVOL flexo folder gluer strategy in our box plants. We added 1 machine at our Dayton, New Jersey plant. Through the end of March, we have installed 12 of total 30 EVOLs that we plan to install in fiscal year '17. In April, we installed an EVOL in our Montgomery, Alabama plant, and we will install another one later in the quarter in our Lancaster, Pennsylvania plant. These investments are greatly enhancing the capabilities and productivity of our box plant system.", "Our Corrugated Packaging team delivered excellent performance this quarter. I'm very pleased with our results that reflect both improving industry demand and the progress we're making on our commercial and operational excellence initiatives.", "During the March quarter, the CRB market gained strength and the SBS market remained in balance. CRB industry backlogs, as of the week ending April 15, stood at 144,000 tons, 23% higher than last year's backlogs. RockTenn's CRB backlogs are about 3 weeks. SBS industry operating rates were at 95%, with industry backlogs of approximately 4.5 weeks. RockTenn's most recent SBS backlogs are at about 8 weeks. RockTenn's SBS and pulp volumes were lower than the prior-year quarter as a result of the March major maintenance outage at Demopolis. This was 1 month earlier than last year. Minor and major outages alternate every year.", "Industry folding carton volumes were down in the March quarter by 2.8% compared to the prior year quarter. As mentioned earlier, our folding carton volumes were up 1.1% for the same period, driving our growth compared to the industry. The RockTenn team performed extraordinarily well, with net sales of $320 million. This represents a record March quarter for the division.", "The promotional displays business has been impacted by the changing purchasing patterns of large retailers and consumer packaged goods companies looking to reduce their overall cost structure. Some large retailers are reducing the number of promotional displays in order to cut costs. Consumer packaged goods companies are actively evaluating their supply chains to reduce cost and, in some cases, they're investing to reconfigure their distribution systems. These changes had a direct impact on our results in the quarter. Merchandising Displays segment sales were flat as compared to the prior year quarter. The 2 acquisitions we made last year contributed $17 million in sales over the prior year quarter, and our sales of permanent displays increased by $3 million. Our sales of temporary displays declined by $21 million from the prior year quarter.", "We have had significant amounts of new contracted business, which have required investments in people and infrastructure, both to support the new business as well as future growth opportunities. Due to the changing market conditions and our previous investments to support the growth, we expect profitability in this segment to be about $25 million in fiscal year '15. In light of the changing customer demand, we're adjusting our cost structure and expect improved results in fiscal year '16. Merchandising Displays adds significant value to our enterprise. Displays innovation and relationships helped both our container and folding carton businesses with new business opportunities. Displays purchases from our Corrugated Packaging and Consumer Packaging businesses also benefit RockTenn overall.", "Lower recycled fiber prices, soft demand in China and the West Coast port labor disputes drove the negative year-over-year results in our recycling business. We believe the resolution of the West Coast labor disputes and the potential for stronger Chinese demand later in the year will translate into stronger results.", "Our Recycling business provides secure, cost-effective access to recycled fiber. This provides a competitive advantage for our mill system and also provides market intelligence for our overall business. The Recycling team does this very well.", "I'll turn it over to Ward, who will now discuss various financial aspects of our business. Ward?", "Ward H. Dickson", "Thank you, Steve. This quarter's selling price and mix were unfavorable to the March quarter of last year. This decline is primarily driven by the Corrugated segment. 2/3 of this decline is related to the adverse impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on export containerboard pricing and box shipments into Canada and Mexico. The remainder of the decline is largely due to customer mix changes in corrugated box. Domestic box pricing was stable during the quarter. Export containerboard pricing declined by $35 per ton year-over-year, with most of that decline occurring last summer and fall when the currency impacts were quite rapid. Export markets have stabilized and volumes continue to be strong and export prices only declined by $5 per ton on a sequential basis. We experienced a favorable cost environment this quarter and had net cost deflation of approximately $45 million as compared to last year. Energy prices, driven by a 40% reduction in natural gas, generated a $40 million benefit. Declines in fiber cost, primarily recycled fiber, contributed approximately $30 million benefit. These benefits were partially offset by higher wage, benefits and other cost inflation. We generated $22 million in cost-savings and productivity improvements this quarter over the prior year and have good momentum as we enter into our merger with MWV. Nonrecurring items in the quarter included the impact of the Panama City electrical outage, the La Tuque labor disruption and the Demopolis scheduled maintenance outage which occurred in the June quarter last year.", "We continued to generate strong free cash flow at a level of $159 million or $1.11 per share during the quarter. Over the last 12 months, we have generated free cash flow of $845 million or $5.86 per share. At the end of March, our net debt was approximately $2.75 billion. Our LTM Credit Agreement EBITDA was $1.6 billion and our leverage ratio was 1.74x.", "At March 31, we had used all but $5 million of our U.S. federal and foreign net operating losses. We still have approximately $56 million of various state net operating losses and other state credits available for use in future years. We also have significant remaining U.S. federal cellulosic biofuel, alternative minimum tax and other federal tax credits that can be used to offset a total of $188 million of U.S. cash taxes. We expect to use these during fiscal years 2015 and 2016.", "The June quarter should be the last quarter we make any substantial pension contributions into our U.S. plans. Immediately after the merger, we will merge the overfunded MWV plans with the RockTenn plans.", "In terms of our CapEx guidance. We expect that the RockTenn 2015 capital expenditures will continue to be in the range of $500 million to $550 million. Maintenance downtime in the March quarter of 93,000 tons was slightly higher than last year's downtime of 73,000 tons. The majority of this maintenance downtime is in our Corrugated segment. The June quarter is our heaviest maintenance outage quarter, as we plans to take maintenance downtime of 116,000 tons at several of our key mills. At the end of March, our containerboard system inventory was 40,000 tons higher than 1 year ago. We have increased our inventory levels to better support our customers. Our inventory will peak in May at 10,000 tons higher than March and then should decline from there by 50,000 tons by the end of September.", "Now I will turn it back over to Steve, who will discuss our outlook.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Thanks, Ward. I'm pleased with our results this quarter and the strides we are making across our businesses in improving operating efficiency and offering customer-focused solutions. Our Corrugated Packaging business is performing very well. Box volumes are growing and box pricing continues to be stable. Domestic containerboard market conditions are solid, and strengthening seasonally. Export market volumes continue to be strong and pricing is reasonable, considering the currency situation. Our mills and box plants are operating well. Folding carton demand is also solid and we're seeing strengthening in SBS and CRB markets and backlogs.", "Merger integration activity is going very well. We're on track to complete the merger in June. Our integration teams are working to ensure we can hit the ground running on day 1, that we achieve and drive to exceed our synergy targets. As we work together, we continue to identify new opportunities. I plan to give a more detailed summary of our synergy and performance improvement opportunities as well as our road map to achieve them on our July earnings call.", "Our new company will have a great business platform, strong cash flows and a solid balance sheet. Our capital allocation will center around a normalized leverage ratio of 2.25x to 2.5x. On day 1, our leverage ratio should be at approximately 2x, excluding the benefit of future synergies. Our leverage ratio is higher than both companies' current levels because we will be funding approximately $750 million at closing to repurchase the necessary RockTenn shares to reduce RockTenn's ownership interest of the new company to below 50%, and we will also use these funds for -- to pay deal-related transaction costs. With the strength of our balance sheet and underlying cash flows, we will have a balanced capital allocation strategy that will allow us to pay an attractive dividend; continue to invest in our business; take advantage of accretive business opportunities, including acquisitions; and return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases.", "We've considered postmerger dividend strategy. While that's a decision for the new board, I have some thoughts I will share with you now. We've had many conversations with shareholders over the last 3 months. As we always do, we listen. Our dividend policy should reflect that as a large-cap company with strong cash flows, we should pay an attractive dividend when compared to large-cap indices. When setting the dividend, we'll take into account the impact of the planned spin of Specialty Chemicals on our financial statements and also on our total market capitalization. I remain confident in the opportunities in front of us. This combination is a terrific opportunity to leverage the best of each company to create significant value for our customers and shareholders.", "As we expect to close on the merger this quarter, it's difficult to provide our guidance with respect to the reported results for the new company. The reported results will be a blend of both companies' results during the quarter. If you're looking for help in your modeling, I would guide you to RockTenn's adjusted EPS for the June quarter on a stand-alone basis being about 20% higher than the $0.85 we earned in the March quarter.", "Now with that, Jim, Mike, Ward and I are now ready to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Mr. Mark Weintraub of Buckingham Research Group.", "Mark Adam Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "I was hoping maybe to get a little bit more color, if possible, on the guidance for RockTenn-specific earnings. You had mentioned about 20% higher. And is -- any bridges that you could provide for us, what the big drivers to the plus side and minus side would be?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Mark, we're moving to, I think, seasonally stronger demand and I think we've got -- it's almost a continuation of the factors that we saw this quarter.", "Mark Adam Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay. And I guess, I want to just follow up on it. On Slide 10, you noted $22 million of nonrecurring when -- versus the prior year. I believe that would be the Panama City. Does that also include -- what else would be included in that $22 million? And do we get that as we go from the current quarter to the June quarter?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Mark, Ward will respond to that.", "Ward H. Dickson", "So Mark, you're right. In the -- included in the $22 million was 3 primary drivers. We had the impact at Panama City, La Tuque, the timing of the Demopolis outage, which is really, on a year-over-year basis, it's the timing of the quarterly profile of that outage. We also had the gain of the MRO benefit that we highlighted in the press release. So those are truly -- other than the timing of Demopolis on a year-over-year basis, those are truly nonrecurring items.", "Mark Adam Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay. And I guess -- so then, we'll also have -- as you think about going to the next quarter, maybe one of the offsets is that we're -- given that there's going to be more maintenance downtime. I guess that's the other factor included...", "Ward H. Dickson", "That's right.", "Operator", "The next question is coming from the line of Mr. George Staphos from Bank of America.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I appreciate the presentation and the details. I recognize that July you'll probably give an update on synergies and other factors in terms of road map with MWV, but can you comment at all in terms of your confidence in the synergy targets that you initially pointed to with your colleagues at MWV? Where are you finding the sources of the most confidence if, in fact, that's the correct statement? Any thoughts here would be appreciated, and then I had a quick follow-on on containerboard inventories.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I'd just -- the number we put out was $300 million for the synergies. We've done a substantial amount of work. I think we have talked about opportunities. I think we're finding in the paper business there's probably more opportunities that we have inside the mill system. It's not so substantial that I would change the $300 million. And I think I would point out, when we get to July, I want to put in context both that $300 million but also in context the other productivity improvements that we have, so that you, as an analyst, can track our overall performance as a company. And that's the intent. I'm just -- the mechanics of doing that now, it's a little bit premature to provide that level of specificity at this point.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Steve, we understand that and that's helpful. I guess my other question would be, you cited the inventory levels -- I don't have my notes that I took down here, but you're I think 30,000, 40,000 tons up from a year ago, and then inventories are going to drop 50,000 tons or so through September. Are inventories where you wanted them to be? Again, thank you for the detail in actually describing what they are currently. Are they where you wanted them to be? Are they tighter than you want or they may be a little bit heavier than you would've wanted, given the demand outlook?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "So George, Jim Porter is going to respond to that.", "James B. Porter", "I think we're pretty pleased with where our inventories are. We are constantly focused, primarily, on trying to satisfy our customers' requirements with products on time and doing so in a way that delivers them with low-cost freight and the best logistics that we can. And what we've learned is, our system functions better with a somewhat higher inventory level than certainly where we began some years ago. And as we look forward to the very heavy shutdown period that we have coming up or our seasonal maintenance requirements at our large mills, we need this inventory to carry us over. And I think we're really just right on track.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming the line of Mr. Mark Wilde from BMO Capital Markets.", "Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research", "Steve, just any updates on kind of thoughts coming out of the combination in terms of the balance sheet. You're only about 1.75x levered right now -- Mead similarly, MeadWestvaco is in pretty good shape. So just any updated thoughts on that.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Yes, our target leverage ratio will be 2.25x to 2.5x. I think that's where we start. RockTenn's leverage ratio was 2x on unfunded pension plans, so that increment is appropriate. We're going to come out of the box at 2x because of the repurchase of the RockTenn shares and also the funding of transaction costs. I think from there, we'll I think operate with a balanced capital allocation program that, I think, served us well. Where we seek opportunities to grow and if we have good investment opportunities, we invest in our businesses. And to the extent we don't, we feel very comfortable returning that cash to shareholders, with either a dividend and/or share repurchases.", "Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research", "Okay. And if I could, just for a follow-on, Steve, can you just update us on kind of major capital projects within kind of legacy RockTenn? I know that you have made some more moves down at Florence. I don't know whether what you've announced down there to this point is kind of the full drill for Florence going forward?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I think current capital projects like -- help me out, Jim, we have on the Stevenson project...", "James B. Porter", "Exactly, the pulp mill improvement initiatives at Stevenson to change our cooking process, which is approximately $47 million. We have a large recovery -- or excuse me, power boiler project at Demopolis. You mentioned Florence, we completed our large wood yard project down there that has dramatically improved our capabilities in the back-end of our operations. And then there's just the continuing runway of investments that improve our efficiency and quality across the portfolio.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I think just, Mark, in addition to that, we're putting a biomass boiler at Demopolis. And I think we talked about our EVOLs. I think, going forward, we have done a substantial amount of work on our mill system. And I think with the combination, we're effectively updating that because we're going to have a larger mill system and we're going to have, I think, additional opportunities. And that's the type of work that I think we're doing now. In addition, we're also looking at our box system for kind of, call it, the next phase of capital investment.", "Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research", "Yes, okay. And it looks like, from the outside, you're getting -- you're combining with a pretty well-capitalized mill system.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I would agree with that.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And the next question will be coming from the line of Mr. Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "As you think about the merger as it closes, the thing that's really fascinating I think to a lot of folks is we now finally have pretty much all the paperboard substrates under one roof. And as we've seen in the corrugated world in the last, actually 30 years, but really intensively in the last several, is the vertical integration with the box system. And my perception is, when you look at paperboard, there's a lot less vertical integration, that most of the folding carton work is done by smaller private companies. Do you think that there's an opportunity for you to increase your -- or is it a desire to for--, integrate further down into converting over time, now that you have sort of the ability to self supply all these different substrates?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I think it's premature to come to that conclusion. I met with about 30 of our sales managers last night and I think they're going to market. I've met with customers and I think our customers and our salespeople are very enthusiastic about the prospect of going to market with that. And I think we're -- we sell a lot of paper to converters and we value those relationships. We also sell converted product to our customers, and we value those relationships. So I think it's hard to say that we would look at one or the other as having a -- at this point, a better -- and just being a better opportunity for us.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Okay. And then just -- well, second to the last question, if you could talk a little bit about the potential, as you see this strong growth in the box business, to -- or should I say, the tension between continuing with the export strategy versus pulling tons out of the export market back into the U.S. It would seem like given the differential in pricing, you're certainly, in the near-term, better off pulling board back in. On the other hand, you have to manage customer relationships overseas as well. And how do you think about that?", "James B. Porter", "This is Jim Porter. I think we've shared previously that we've -- we look at our business through really the 3 channels that we operate in. One, is our internal converted product channels, where we serve all of our domestic end-use customers. Secondly, our domestic independent customers. And thirdly, our international customers. And we've really built a very deep and rich relationship across the world with these customers, and so we value them all extremely much. However, we do look at the integrated profitability of each of those particular channels. And when we're making decisions about where we optimize our mix of business, we would shift volumes between those channels where the opportunities create the most cash flow. So that's how we think about it and we operate daily on that basis.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Adam Josephson from KeyBanc.", "Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Jim, just one more for you on containerboard. You mentioned your domestic prices were stable sequentially, despite the fact that medium prices came down in February. I mean, can you talk about whether you saw or expect to see any impact from that medium price reduction? And given your view that conditions are fairly healthy, why medium prices came down in February?", "James B. Porter", "Okay. So I'm generally pretty bullish, frankly, about all our markets, and I think we're going into a period of seasonal strengthening. The medium thing, I'm really not clear why pulp was down. We didn't see a market shift. It did. And clearly in those situations where we have relationships that are tied to the index, it moves. But it's not going to impact our earnings significantly and we clearly do not see a degradation in those markets. To the contrary, we see demand strengthening and the market's firm. As you look internationally, demand is also quite solid and, for the last number of months, we've seen really pretty flat pricing environments across those markets. There certainly has been a currency-related bias and so on a year-over-year basis, as we look at the -- where the euro has fallen that the -- any softening in our export prices has been nowhere near that magnitude. So it's really a tribute to the strength of our markets. And I feel pretty good about things.", "Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "And just one more on box shipments for you and for the industry. Obviously, they were pretty healthy in the first quarter for you. Are you surprised by the extent to which shipments have held up? Obviously, the U.S. -- the GDP number came in yesterday was not very good. The economy is just not looking all that hot, yet you're seeing pretty healthy demand. Are you at all surprised by the rate of growth that you're experiencing or that the industry is experiencing, given that you would think boxes would be a pretty good barometer of what's happening more broadly?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I think, just the GDP number did come out as disappointing. I think if you go behind the scenes on that, it's -- drilling activity is down, oil and gas industry is down. I think the Long Beach situation had an impact. We're not really affected by those directly. In fact, we're probably helped with that because of the reduced oil prices. What we've seen it's put more money in people's pockets to be able to -- in order to spend on things. And we make nondurable goods. And I think box demand going up higher than the economy, what we've experienced over the past, call it, 6 months, that's not surprising to me. The spread, I'm not a good enough judge to know whether the spread is greater or less than I would've expected because I really would not have had an expectation for that.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The next question will be coming from the line of Ms. Debbie Jones from Deutsche Bank.", "Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I realize there are a lot of moving parts in Merchandising Displays. I'd like to get a sense of what opportunities you have to improve profitability in this segment. Do you think you can get back to that, call it, maybe a $15 million quarterly run rate in 2016 or is that a 2017 event? And how might the -- can you comment on the mix of new business and how that will compare to your existing business?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I don't want to set an expectation of what we would do in fiscal year '16. I think I'd commented that we do have a bunch of moving parts. I am feeling confident that we're going to get the business aligned to where it can be -- it can continue to be very profitable and an important part of our business. We're on the front end of the changes in the, I'd say, the retail environment and the way the CPGs are responding to it. And so we're -- just right now, we're bearing the brunt of that. I think long term, it's going to be very helpful because we're going to be in a position to understand what's happening in the retail market and for our consumer packaged goods companies. So we're -- I think we're going to be able to have a very strong business, and that's going to fit in very well with packaging solutions business of the merged company.", "Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And my second question, on the Recycling business, you mentioned the expectation for maybe stronger Chinese demand later in the year. I know we've seen this in -- potentially on trader reports, but are you seeing anything that gives you encouragement on this from your vantage point?", "James B. Porter", "Debbie, Jim Porter. China, wow, I don't know. Short answer. We all know a bit about China and clearly, they've been through a softening period. They still make a lot of paper over there. I think the port phenomenon really has dramatically shifted where that fiber had come from to supply their needs. And while they have been down over the last couple of years compared to where they were a few years prior to that, really have no line of sight as to what their true demand structure is going to do. But we do believe that, with the port situation easing, that a more normalized flow from North America to China will resume, which we would believe would create an upward bias to pricing. But going beyond that, really, would be a long shot call.", "Operator", "Our next question will be coming from the line of Mr. George Staphos of Bank of America.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "When we look at the investments that you're making in the corrugated network, and certainly we're seeing improvement in earnings for RockTenn, and that's a good thing, how do you balance the need to go with EVOLs and more productive die cutters with the risk that you ultimately over capitalize and/or create more capacity than you'd like in the converting business. Recognizing that converting is different than mills, you don't run to an operating rate per se, but tell us how you manage that risk, if you see it as a risk at all? And then the other question I had, just on fixed cost. Doing some very quick calculations, it seems like your fixed cost inflation is currently running at around $100 million or so based on the fiscal 2Q result that's not different than what you've seen in the past. What can you do, if anything, to maintain that level, perhaps drop it or should we assume a 2% or 3% rate of inflation on fixed cost going forward?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I think just with respect to box plant system, I think our company has a philosophy of matching our -- what we produce with market demand, and that's what we've done in container. Just in circumstances where we've put in EVOLs, we have typically taken out 2 to 4 older pieces of equipment. There are a couple of circumstances where we will keep maybe one of those machines in the corner, in the event demand goes up. But the economics of the EVOLs, in addition to providing just a more efficient piece of equipment, those economics are accompanied by a cost reduction when we put them in. So I think that's responsive to your first question. The second question, I need -- we either need to go offline, because I'm not tracking the $100 million. Do you...", "Ward H. Dickson", "Well, the biggest component of our noncommodity inflation is wage inflation, and we have a -- and that's in a -- we experienced a 2% to 3% wage and benefit cost inflation every year. That can easily be $60 million to $75 million a year of inflation that we have to fight. It is part of the culture inside of RockTenn that we drive cost reduction targets across the entire organization. Our Six Sigma functions support productivity initiatives in our manufacturing facilities but, as well, we take the same approach in our support organizations in our operating expense structure. So that's an ongoing tension that's in the financial model that we are driving cost reductions against every year.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So Ward, just a quick follow-on, the 2% to 3%, is that net of the Six Sigma? Or you think the Six Sigma and other efforts can maybe lower that rate of growth?", "Ward H. Dickson", "Yes, so the -- what I was identifying was just the inflation itself. The Six Sigma contributes to our productivity, both in our operating expense leverage and then also in our labor productivity that occurs in our facilities -- manufacturing facilities.", "Operator", "Our next question will be coming from the line of Mr. Anthony Pettinari of Citigroup.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just following up on Chip's question on sales synergies with the new portfolio. Steve, you referenced some excitement in the sales organization, and is it possible to say whether did the upside in sales synergies come more from having all 3 boxboard grades under the same roof or do you think there's more opportunities from having the leading containerboard franchise and the leading boxboard franchise under the same roof?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I think it's the breadth of product offering that we have, which would include what you just talked about, and I think the converting as well as the paper. And just being able to talk to customers about the broad product offering, I think just ends up creating opportunities. I think one of the things MWV is bringing to the company is a -- just a great commercial excellence capability, and I think that's something we also have at RockTenn. I think the combined companies are going to -- we're going to be able to go to market and I think talk to customers and provide services. But I can't fully describe what's going to happen, but we've got great people and we've got customer opportunities. And I think extraordinary things will end up happening.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then, following up on that, prior to the merger, you made some realignments in how the paper business and the packaging business were organized, and there was kind of a goal of gaining some sales synergies on that reorganization. Have you kind of seen some of the fruits of that realignment already, x what's going on with MeadWestvaco?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "We have, and I think just -- we did organize into packaging solutions and paper solutions. We have had, I think very, good success going to the -- many of our customers with the broad product line. And the addition of MWV just makes that even better. I think we did put out an announcement on executive leadership, and we've maintained the packaging and paper solutions framework. And I think we have very good momentum on how we go to market, and have a lot of people spending a lot of time on that. And I think the enthusiasm I see across the organization is deserved, and I think is -- I think will bear us well as we go forward.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And the next question will be coming from the line of Mr. Alex Ovshey of Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "On your box shipment volumes and outperformance relative to the industry, which is very impressive, can you say how much of that is driven by new contract wins that should stay in the business model beyond just a quarter or a several-month bump to the volume?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "It's hard to quantify that. I think what we've seen -- we've gone through, I think, a couple of cycles where we lagged the industry. Now we've got a quarter to where we exceeded the industry. I think you have to go back to the fundamentals of what the management team has been doing in Container, which I think is doing the right things for the long-term. And it's a complicated project, it's a multi-year project and I think we're beginning to see the fruits of that. And so the box business right now is stronger than it's ever been. And I think that's because they are doing the right things that you need to do to operate a profitable box business.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then just on the cost side, in your slide deck you show a diesel exposure of 63 million gallons, What does that actually mean? So I guess, from the highs to where we are, diesel prices are down about $1. So does that mean that, on that component, you should see a $63 million annualized benefit to the P&L? Can you just provide a little more color around what your diesel exposure number in the presentation means?", "Ward H. Dickson", "So that does show our volume of consumption on an annual basis. Embedded in our inflation numbers are the benefit that we've got from the lower diesel fuel surcharges that we have. And it's partially offset, though, by higher freight rates. So the math is not quite $15 million worth of benefit in the quarter. It was something that was less than approximately $10 million. But it is flowing through the P&L and it is one of the components of our deflation, but it's been partially offset by higher freight rates.", "Operator", "Our last question will be coming from the line of Mr. Philip Ng from Jefferies.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Just taking -- backing off of Mark's question earlier, assuming MeadWestvaco deal closes as planned, is it fair to assume that another transformative acquisition is probably unlikely for next year or 2? The reason why I ask is, given your targeted leverage target and just your free cash flow profile, this should give you a lot of runway on the buyback front in the next few years. And just wondering, last year, did discussion with MeadWestvaco early last year limit some of that ability early on in the year?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "That's a difficult one to answer. I think one of the great things about the new company is that we do have a platform for growth and so we will continue to look at opportunities. And I would expect we'll have opportunities to go forward, but we're not really commenting any more than that, just I can't. I mean, it's -- our primary focus now is to merge the companies, get the organization working and get the most out of the existing organizations. So that's the job we're focused on now.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess a question for Jim. Good to see strong momentum in Corrugated late in the quarter, but can you give a sense how demand is tracking in April? I think you might have touched upon it. And what's your outlook for the full year? Are the momentum that you've seen in the box business sustainable?", "James B. Porter", "I think we're on a very positive trend. We're seeing the start of April very much like we saw in March. And seasonally we're going into a period where winter is over, people are outdoors, they're spending more money on the stuff that we package, and so I think the outlook is good. So that's really the run rate we see, both in the folding carton as well as the corrugated business.", "Operator", "Our next question will be coming from the line of Mr. Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo.", "Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "A couple of questions, and then just a housekeeping one. But really to kind of come back to the box elements and the folding carton element as well, is this kind of a function of -- I think you mentioned you're 12 or 13 of your EVOLs in of a 30 process, so you've got enough critical mass as you sit there today to continue to do a little better than the market. I mean, I think you were under the market for a couple of years as you were beginning this process. What you cited was better quality, better service, et cetera. So do you feel that as you finish rolling out this process, you're at a point where you've kind of re-earned the right to do some business with customers to continue to grow at or better with them? I mean how do you think about that process?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "You've kind of said how we think about it. I'm not sure I can add very much. I mean, they've done a great job of I think improving the business and have it on very stable footing and have the opportunity to continuing to improve. So I think that's the -- thank you for articulating the story.", "Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "No problem. A follow-up to that, I guess -- or maybe I'll ask a couple housekeeping questions. Have you settled on a new name for the company in the fiscal year, things of that nature?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "We have not settled on a new name. I think with respect to fiscal year, we plan to be on September 30 fiscal year.", "Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. Can you maybe give us a sense, too, on the folding carton side, I think you were up 1 point or so and the industry was down a 1 or 2 points, maybe some of what's happened there? You've been closer to the market the last few years. Is there just something basically with customer mix or some segments that you're involved with that's helped you kind of outperform there? And then the sustainability of that?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "Mike?", "Michael E. Kiepura", "Sure, I think it is similar to the strategy that we've outlined on the container side in terms of really focusing on satisfying the customer with outstanding quality and service, and doing that in a cost-competitive way. So to the extent that we bring along those measures, that we're going to be rewarded with the business. And folding has been taking that approach for the last many years; and certainly container after the Smurfit acquisition 4 years ago, similarly. So I think both of our main converting businesses, box and cartons, are reaping the benefit of that focus on satisfying the customer and bringing value cost competitively. And we're seeing that in the improved volumes.", "Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. One last, if can sneak it in. It looked like your utilization rates in the quarter were in that 92% range. Is that just a function of -- you've typically been more in the mid-90s, more like 95%. Is that just a function of some of the issues at Panama, on outages or things? Or how should we think about that on a go-forward basis?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "It's more of a function of the outage schedule. So I think that 80,000 tons -- I think we're 96.5% if you adjusted the outages out of the calculation.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The next question will be coming from the line of Mr. Mark Connelly from CLSA.", "Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "Two things, Steve. First, can you talk a little bit about your expectations for virgin and recycled fiber costs in the next quarter? So it doesn't look like input costs are clearly causing you a lot of margin trouble so far, and I'm just curious where you think that's going. And second, from your comments, it sounds like Recycled and waste is maybe more of a strategically important cost center than a meaningful profit center. I'm going to guess that you guys are going to stop reporting it, so maybe this is the last time we'll get to see it. Is there more restructuring to come in that business? Or should we just sort of think that what it's done for the last couple of years is what it's going to do?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I'm going to take the second question and then Michael can start on the fiber and then allow Jim to talk about the virgin and recycled. I think you articulated the Recycling as a strategic cost center. We have split it out as a segment, but I think your view of it is an appropriate view and so I would not expect that to be reported as a separate segment. We've done a lot of restructuring in the business over a period of time. We shut down, I think, an excess of 10 plants and so we've got over -- and now Jim is telling me it's 29 plants, and that's in excess of 10. But I mean, we've done a lot of restructuring, and the impact -- the cumulative impact of that has been with our eye on the strategic cost centers as compared to stand-alone business, our new segments will reflect that going forward. I think with respect to virgin and recycled, our virgin costs have been very -- have been managed extremely well. I think we just have a terrific procurement department in wood. And I think that has helped -- we're reaping the benefits of that. And I think with respect to the direction of virgin and recycled, Jim?", "James B. Porter", "Okay, Steve. So I would build on the -- kind of relative to our Recycling business, because we're in the -- the making of paper and it's all about fiber. And so our recycled system is very important to us as we use just south of 5 million tons, so we need to be very good at buying fiber. And that's what that business allows us to do. We have rightsized it with closing over half of the facilities. And the ones remaining are very strategic parts of our business from a supply chain standpoint to supply our mills. And so I think we've got that business on a very important state, at present. And costs have come down. Wood recycle. Wood down year-over-year, wood down sequential quarter. We're generally very pleased with how our system's functioning. Our team has really improved the management of our inventories and put our supply chains in a much better stead so that we're not having to react to weather and various special cause situations. So we've got a much more stable and efficient wood process. Will it trend it up or down? We think we're in a really pretty stable position relative to wood. Recycled fiber, we've continued to have a period of declining fiber prices. There are some indications that we may have bottomed. And with the port situation cleaning up, we would expect Asian demand to increase and we're starting to see that a bit in the international markets. And so I would say there's likely some upward trend line on recovered fiber. But we don't see that as being something that is an extraordinary spike. I hope that's responsive.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I think we allowed 1 hour or the call, and we're past that. But we'll take another question if somebody has it.", "Operator", "The next question will be coming from the line of Mr. Mark Wilde from BMO Capital Markets.", "Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research", "Yes, just to 2 quick follow-ups, Steve. One, you're still about 300 to 500 basis points below your 2 big public peers in the containerboard and corrugated business. I'd like to get your thoughts on narrowing that gap over time. And then the other question I had is I think you have some kind of a joint venture relationship with David S. Smith over in Europe. The Europeans seem to be kind of way ahead of us on shelf-ready packaging, and I would just wonder how applicable you think some of that stuff is to the North American market?", "Steven C. Voorhees", "I'm going to allow Jim to the relative margin question.", "James B. Porter", "Thank you, Mark, for that question. We get that often. But we've got a, I think, a very good system and we have some very good competitors. I think you've seen us do a lot of heavy lifting to put our portfolio of containerboard mills and Corrugated Packaging operations under a much better state of management. The relationships with our customers has been deepened. Our commercial execution, our cost management have all been improved dramatically, and I think we're seeing that gap close. And you can bet every single day, we are focused on doing more of that. So I think, over time, you will see us get better. I can't speak to what our competitors are going to do, but I'm sure they're not going to stand still. And where it all goes from a pure margin standpoint compared to each metric, I really wouldn't predict. But we are keenly focused on generating free cash flow for our shareholders and satisfying our customers.", "Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research", "But structurally, Jim, is there any reason for the gap to kind of maintain at that level?", "James B. Porter", "You can look at...", "Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research", "I know you guys export a lot, right, so that might be a piece of the equation. But I think at least 1 of the 2 peers also exports. But I'm just trying to figure out whether this is something that's fixable or you can tighten over time.", "James B. Porter", "We're constantly focused on that, Mark, and we do have a portfolio of customers that are our customers and that mix is our mix, and it is different from that mix for our other competitors. And so we have similar businesses, but they're different. And so I really could not try to predict what any structural change would be going forward. We're constantly trying to optimize our system and that's our focus.", "Steven C. Voorhees", "And just with respect to the question on Europe. We do have a licensing arrangement with DS Smith to market some equipment, which has worked out really well for us. I think the issue of shelf-ready packaging and the application of, call it, retail that we're seeing in Europe applicable to the U.S., that's there, meaning, as an issue. Many of our customers have purchasing organizations in Switzerland. A benefit of the merger, for me, is that we'll now have physical operations in Europe and we will have a office in Geneva and we will be able to have, I think, constructive dialogue with customers about to the extent that it does come here or vice versa, I think we're going to be well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities. So I think you've articulated one of the potential benefits of acquisition. The merger is not based on that, but the economics or the potential for improvement is there.", "Operator", "Thank you.

My name is Kristin, I will be your conference operator for today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the WestRock Third Quarter FY15 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, slides are being presented today as part of the conference call. These slides can be accessed at www.westrock.com under the investor page. Ladies and gentlemen, this call is being recorded today, July 30. [Operator Instructions]", "Your speakers for today's call are Mr. Steve Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Ward Dickson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Voorhees, you may begin your conference.", "Steve Voorhees", "Good morning. Welcome to the first WestRock conference call. This is Steve Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer. I appreciate you investing your time to learn more about our new Company. I'm joined this morning by Ward Dickson, Chief Financial Officer; Jim Porter, President of our Paper Solutions business; and Bob Beckler, President of our Packaging Solutions business.", "During the course of the call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs, related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discuss during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our WestRock S-4 filing, and the most recent 10-K's and 10-Q's, followed by our predecessor Companies, RockTenn and MeadWestvaco.", "We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We've provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation. The slide presentation is available on our website.", "Since we napped the merger in January, we've been working on integrating the predecessor organizations into WestRock. We have enthusiastic alignment across the Company about our aspiration to be the global, industry leader in consumer and Corrugated Packaging markets. And, we've made substantial progress in structuring our organization externally, with our customers and suppliers, and internally across our 275 operating and business locations around the world.", "We've identified and organized ourselves to capture the synergies and performance improvements, that we have available to us from the merger, and also from the momentum both organizations had, going into the merger. We're very excited about the strength of our new Company and the opportunity to protect real value for our customers, stockholders and employees.", "I feel good about the progress we're making to develop the WestRock culture. Of course, our success depends on delivering strong results. With that in mind, I'm turning to what we've done in the most recent quarter. Because the merger closed on July 1, we are not reporting consolidated WestRock results this quarter. We are reporting RockTenn's complete financial results for the June quarter.", "We're also reporting net sales and segment income information from MeadWestvaco. We do not plan to report to complete financial results for MeadWestvaco for the June quarter. While I understand this may be of interest to the investment community, we've chosen not to maintain the administrative infrastructure, and incur the expense necessary to report MeadWestvaco's complete financial results.", "The segment results show the detail regarding the current performance of our business. And, we're providing details about the combined results of both Companies in our new segment reporting structure. We have accomplished a tremendous amount since announcing the merge six months ago. And, I want to thank the WestRock team for maintaining our focus on serving our customers, and operating very efficiently, while at the same time working diligently on integration.", "The financial results in the June quarter for each predecessor Company bears this out. RockTenn's adjusted EPS of $1.15 increased by 17% over last year. MWV segment income increased by 7%. Our combined segment income was up 10%. I'm particularly pleased with the strong returns in the WestRock Corrugated Packaging business in North America and Brazil. In our Consumer Packaging business, Folding Carton, Food & Beverage and Home, Health & Beauty all performed well.", "We're delivering on the envisioned benefits of our combination. At the time we announced the merger, we committed to a $300 million merger-related synergy target that represented approximately 7% of the revenue of MWV packaging business. This was on top of the approximate $700 million in the ongoing contribution for programs we already had in place, to improve productivity through process improvement and capital investment. Going forward, we will track the total $1 billion synergy and performance improvement target.", "The overall goal is more readily identifiable in our financial statements, and we'll avoid the non-value added effort of determining whether an individual action is merger or performance related. We expect to reach the billion dollar target before the impact of inflation, by the end of FY18. This represents approximately 7% of our total revenue, excluding the Specialty Chemicals business. By the end of this September quarter, we expect to be at a run rate of $150 million in merger-related synergies and performance improvements.", "An additional benefit of the merger is the ability to combine the over-funded MWV pension plans with the under-funded RockTenn plans. During the first week of July, we merged our US qualified pension plans. And as a result, we will avoid over $550 million in future pension contributions, including $14 million that would have otherwise been contributed on July 15.", "Our confidence in achieving our future cash flows, supports our stockholder return strategy that we announced on July 1. And, is comprised of $1.50 per share dividend and a 40 million share repurchase authorization, that we intend to use to achieve our target leverage ratio of 2.25 times to 2.5 times. Our pro forma leverage at closing was right at 2 times.", "WestRock will report our results in four business segments. Corrugated Packaging will generate approximately $2 billion in quarterly sales, and will include the RockTenn North American Corrugated Packaging business and Recycling business, and the MWV Brazilian and Indian Corrugated Packaging businesses. At $1.7 billion in quarterly sales, Consumer Packaging will include RockTenn's Consumer Packaging and Merchandising Displays business, and MWV's Food & Beverage and Home, Health & Beauty businesses. Specialty Chemicals and Land and Development will continue as separate segments.", "Sales of our Corrugated Packaging business are approximately $8 billion per year, with the production of 8.5 million tons of a wide variety of paper brands. Of our 8 million tons of production in North America, our box plant system converts about 5 million tons per year, into corrugated packaging. The remaining 3 million tons are sold to independent corrugated converters in North America, and other international markets.", "We've operated an integrated system in Brazil for over 60 years. In 2013, we completed a $500 million investment, including a new paper machine, to grow our corrugated packaging business. About 2/3 of our approximate 500,000 tons of production is converted in our own box plants. I visited these operations last month and was very impressed with the quality of the assets, and the outstanding team we have in place there.", "Turning to the results for the June quarter for our combined corrugated packaging segment, industry demand for corrugated packaging in the United States increased by 1.3%, as measured by daily box shipments, compared to last year. Exports grew by approximately 11%, compared to last year. We exported 316,000 pounds during the quarter, 30,000 tons more than both the March quarter, and last year's quarter. Industry operating rates continued to be solid in the 96% range. We delivered very strong result in North America, as measured by our 200 basis point EBITDA margin improvement, to 19.4%. The performance of our box plant system was a highlight of the quarter. Our volumes increased by 3.9% compared to last year. In July, we've maintained this performance. Box volumes are up 4% over last year.", "We continue to benefit from the cumulative impact of many areas of improvement, executed by our team over the past four years, including quality and customer service. We're now halfway through the installation of 30 EVOL flexo-folder gluers. And, our results today have exceeded our exceeded our expectations. Overall, corrugated box pricing in North America was up 0.6%, as compared to the March quarter, and down 1.5% compared to last year.", "Pricing of domestic containerboard increased about 1% on a sequential basis, and also increased about 1% as compared to last year. Average export pricing declined by 1% from the March quarter, and was down 8.5% compared to last year, due to the strength of the US dollar. Pricing for containerboard for export to Latin America remained stable. Linerboard continues to be tight, but we have taken some economic downtime in medium, to match our supply with our demand. During the June quarter, we took 104,000 tons of maintenance downtime, and less than 20,000 tons of economic downtime. We expect only 4,000 tons of maintenance downtime in the September quarter.", "Our Recycling operation improved profitability during the quarter with segment income of $2.5 million, after a loss in the March quarter of $400,000. This was a result of rising recycle prices and a strong operational cost focus. Consistent with recycling's primary mission of sourcing high-quality fiber for our mills, in June, the recycling group started exporting 6,000 tons per month to our India mills. This has improved fiber quality and reduced our delivered cost.", "Turning to Brazil, Economic conditions remain challenging. While industry demand declined by 2%, we delivered outstanding results with box volume growth of 15%, year over year. EBITDA margins of 28.7% were very strong, up 530 basis points compared to last year. We've seen gains with major national meat and produce customers, as well as growth in food oils and chemical markets. We were successful in raising prices to offset cost inflation.", "The new containerboard machine in Brazil continues next to operate extremely well. June quarter shipments of 125,000 tons set a record, and were 7% higher than one year ago. We're integrating the North American containerboard export business with our export business in Brazil, to increase our efficiency and the value we can provide international customers.", "Sales in our Consumer Packaging business are approximately $7 billion per year. Null production is approximately 4 million tons of a wide variety of paper grades. All of our null production is in North America. Our largest mill is Mahrt, Alabama, which produces over 1 million tons coated natural kraft. Our SBS system produces 2.1 million tons from mills in Covington, Virginia; Demopolis, Alabama; Evadale, Texas; and La Tuque, Quebec.", "We serve markets with high quality requirements, including Food & Beverage, Tobacco and commercial print markets. The recent acquisition of the Carolina branded product line from International Paper improves our position in this attractive segment of the commercial print markets. Our recycled system includes nine mills producing 1 million tons of coated and uncoated recycled paper board. Our folding cartons system consists of 34 plants across North America and Europe, and generate sales of about $2 billion. The WestRock Consumer Packaging business includes our Home, Health & Beauty dispensing business, with approximately $600 million in sales.", "The combination of our dispensing business with our paper packaging businesses provides a unique differentiated offering to these customers. And, we are fully exploring these opportunities with our customers, with very good success. Interestingly, the top four Home, Health & Beauty customers account for more than $150 million in sales, and these same customers purchased 500 million of corrugated boxes, folding cartons and displays, from WestRock.", "Packaging has a very significant impact on our customer's success in their markets. The breadth, depth and scale of WestRock's Consumer and Corrugated Packaging solutions capabilities provides us with a unique opportunity to engage our customers, to work together with us, to help them be successful. Many of our customers are engaging with us on that very basis. I don't think any other company has the same opportunity. And, I'm optimistic about what I've seen so far. That I believe we are, and will be, able to provide perspective, products and services, that will support our customer's success and provide a runway of growth for WestRock.", "Turning to the results for the Consumer Packaging segment. Overall industry null operating rates are stable, with CRB showing the greatest strength. Industry backlogs for CRB are 33% higher than last year, and our backlogs are approximately four weeks to five weeks. We've recently informed our customers of a $50 per ton price increase for CRB, effective next month.", "Industry SBS backlogs have weakened since last year, and our system backlogs are at approximately three weeks to four weeks. After a good beverage season, demand for our coated natural kraft remained solid. And, backlogs are roughly four weeks to five weeks. The Food & Beverage business reported a 13% increase in income, on flat sales, and overcame currency headwinds that reduced sales by $22 million, and income by $5 million. Beverage sales reflected volume growth and share grains in global beer, that were offset by ongoing weakness in carbonated soft drink sales.", "All major regions, including North America, Europe and Asia, contributed to our overall sales growth in beverage. Our food business, in the quarter, was mixed with ongoing weak demand in the US retail food markets. Despite this, we saw demand growth in food service, tobacco and selected retail food applications. During the quarter, we also began successfully on-boarding the Carolina business, and we'll transition to full production from International Paper at the end of the calendar year.", "For the RockTenn Consumer Packaging system, sales were flat with last year, while income increased by 11%. EBITDA margins improved by 140 basis points, to 17.9%. Our converted volumes increased by 4% over the prior year, as we captured new business, leveraging the manufacturing capabilities in our folding carton system. Over the last 18 months, we've started up new processes at our Knoxville, Tennessee; Nicholasville, Kentucky; and Clinton Iowa plants.", "Moving to our Merchandising Displays business. Industry demand for promotional displays is soft, driven by a number of factors, including the shift to the clean floor policy of a major retailer. Merchandising Displays sales declined by 13% compared to last year. While income declined compared to last year, income more than doubled compared to the March quarter. We're working to match our cost structure to our anticipated levels of business, through a number of actions, including streamlining our operations. And, have announced the closure of facilities in Tullahoma, Tennessee; Chattanooga, Tennessee; and Lima, Ohio.", "In the Home, Health & Beauty business income improved by 18%, on lower sales, continuing the productivity improvement trend that we've seen for the past several quarters. Sales declined by 12%, compared to the prior year. But, decreased only 4% on a constant currency basis. The negative currency translation impact was expected, as more than 30% of the sales are from Western Europe. The business executed very well commercially and operationally. We continue to gain volume in value-added segments, including fragrance and trigger sprayers.", "Specialty Chemicals is a $1 billion business with EBITDA margins of over 25%. About 75% of the business produces performance chemicals, including asphalt additives, oil field chemicals and a variety of other products. The Performance Chemical business adapts its refining process to changing market demand. As an example, when demand for oil field chemicals has declined, we've been able to produce other products, including our asphalt additive products, to mitigate the impact of this change in market demand.", "The activated carbon business accounts for 25% of the segment revenue, and has a very strong position in global automotive markets. The business has grown and sustained attractive profitability, based on its consistent ability to identify opportunities and bring value-added solutions to market. We've been investing to expand capacity in Specialty Chemicals. Capital expenditures have been $100 million over the past 12 months, which includes our estimate of ongoing maintenance capital needs of $35 million per year.", "The most significant growth project has been in China, where we have invested in a Greenfield activated carbon plant that will increase our capacity to serve the global automotive market by 15%. This plant will help us maintain our leadership in activated carbon, which is expected to grow with new, more stringent, global automotive emission requirements being phased in over the next several years.", "As much as we like the Specialty Chemicals business, it's not core to WestRock. And, we continue to work towards spinning this business off into a new Company called Ingevity. We're well into our CEO search, and expect to make an announcement in August. We intend to file the initial Form 10 in September. While we anticipate that we will be prepared to initiate the spin at the end of December, we are following guidance from our advisors that the best timing, from an equity capital markets perspective, will be to launch the spinoff to stockholders during the March quarter of 2016.", "For the June quarter, Specialty Chemicals revenue declined 8%, but was down 4% on a currency adjusted basis. Currency headwinds impacted the top line by $11 million. The business had record sales of asphalt additives, and activated carbon, in the quarter, partially offsetting weakness in oil field chemicals and other markets.", "Our patented warm mix paving solution, Evotherm, had strong performance in the US and Europe. Awareness of the performance and sustainability benefits of Evotherm continue to grow. The activated carbon business remains strong, with a growing portion of sales coming from higher-value solutions that address the more stringent automotive emission standards mandated by US regulatory agencies, that phase in beginning in 2017.", "Segment EBITDA margins were 26.7%. On a constant currency basis, EBITDA margins were 27.9%. The business continues to perform exceptionally well.", "WestRock Land and Development is our legacy land development business. Which, after entitling approximately 100,000 acres for development, selling over one million acres of timber and recreational land for over $2 billion, over the last eight years, has now focused on the value-added monetization of the remaining approximately 80,000 acres of development land. Primarily, located in and around Charleston, South Carolina.", "Most of the projects are held in partnerships with Plum Creek Land Company, and others, and are managed by WestRock. Growth channel trends in the Charleston, South Carolina market are very positive. The Port of Charleston is growing. Boeing continues to expand its 787 manufacturing facility. Daimler-Benz is building a new $500 million Sprinter van manufacturing facility, which will employ 1,300 people. And, Volvo recently announced the construction of a $500 million manufacturing facility that will employ 2,000 people.", "Last Friday, WestRock sold a 6,600 acre track for $34 million, for all Volvo's new manufacturing facility. It's nearby commercial and industrial land holdings and master plan communities, including Nexton and Summer's Corner, are well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing regional growth around Charleston. We expect these very favorable market dynamics to support the acceleration of development land sales over the next quarters. We're continuing to pursue the disciplined development of infrastructure, and facilities, necessary to match the increased demand for land from users, developers and home builders, at a pace that maximizes value for stockholders.", "WestRock will generate significant cash flow that will be available to be reinvested in the business, or return to stockholders. We have and will focus on capital allocation. It's critical to our success. We expect to have a tract of opportunities to invest in our business. We've invested $1.8 billion in capital expenditures in our business, during the past two years, including $865 million during the past 12 months.", "These investments include a new paper machine in Brazil, a new biomass boiler at our Covington, Virginia mill, a new wood yard in Florence, South Carolina, 15 new EVOL flexo-folder gluers in our box plant system and the new activated carbon plant in China. WestRock stockholders are the beneficiaries of these investments.", "We've recently completed our capital budget for FY16. The capital budget processes included identifying projects through the multiple lenses of the market, our business strategy, the situation at individual locations. We've prioritized these projects by business and location, in light of the aggregate fit with our business strategy. We plan to invest approximately $850 million in capital, during FY16. We estimate maintenance capital to be $500 million. For the $350 million in return generating projects, we expect to return un-levered after-tax returns in the range of 20%.", "The key return generating capital projects in the paper solutions business are the Demopolis biomass boiler, the rebuild of the bark boiler at Mahrt, the carbonate cook project at the Stevenson, Alabama mill and the evaporator upgrade at the West Point, Virginia mill. Key return generating projects within the packaging solutions group include, the installation of seven additional EVOL flexo-folder gluers in our box plants and three additional presses at our Folding Carton plants, along with the conversion of our plant in the Czech Republic from tobacco to beverage operations.", "We will make other investments in beverage and Home, Health & Beauty, to respond to specific customer requirements. Of $850 million, about $35 million is for Specialty Chemicals in the December quarter, prior to spinoff. After investing the capital necessary to support and improve our business, WestRock will be able to return significant capital to stockholders. During the past 12 months, the combined companies paid $310 million in dividends, and bought 265 million of stock. We would have bought back more stock had we not been prevented from doing so, as a result of the merger.", "We've increased the annual dividend rate to $1.50 per share, or $400 million. And, we are in a position to buy back up to 40 million shares of stock, to move to and maintain our target leverage ratio, that's in the range of 2.25 times to 2.5 times. I like the management team of the combined company. This group has come together extremely well. And, we're working together effectively to with our company forward.", "As many of you know, our Corporate Management team including me, our Chief Financial, Accounting, Human Resource and Sustainability Officers, as well as our General Counsel, are all located in Norcross. Our Chief Communications and Chief Strategy Officer's will be relocating to Norcross.", "We will continue to have a very significant presence in Richmond, which will be the location of our consumer paperboard, beverage, and Home, Health & Beauty businesses, as well as the center of our Research and Development functions for the entire company. And WestRock University, the center of our talent development activities.", "The work that we've done on integrating the businesses, the work we've done on the dividend, share repurchases and the capital budget, the work we've done to put our organization in place, combined with the strong results we've posted for the June quarter, provide us with a firm foundation and momentum as we enter the first year of WestRock. I'll now turn the call over to Ward. And, I will come back after Ward's comments and wrap up the call. Ward?", "Ward Dickson", "Thank you, Steve. Slide 14 is the RockTenn segment income bridge for the June quarter. We had strong growth in segment income, with an increase of $32 million. The combination of price and mix was a negative $34 million, related primarily to the decline in export containerboard, and pulp pricing, over the last year. There has been some price and mix decline in box pricing over the last year, but only at approximately 1.5%.", "Cost deflation continued to be a benefit during the quarter, with reductions on both recycled fiber and virgin fiber. Recycled fiber prices were down approximately 23% from last year. Our overall virgin fiber costs were down 3.8% from last year, from a combination of lower prices, capital investments and the implementation over the last two years of our new wood buying strategy. We continued to make strong productivity gains, generating $31 million in benefit in the quarter, with good momentum as we move to the $1 billion target for combined merger-related synergy and performance improvements.", "D&A, a non-cash item, was $9 million unfavorable. Last year, we recognized a $9 million gain, recording previously unreported spare parts inventories. MWV segment income improved by $14 million over last year, despite the effects of currency. Cost deflation was a $12 million benefit, with gains in energy, fiber and chemicals. Ongoing productivity and margin improvement programs created $21 million in higher earnings, and provide a good platform for our current initiatives. Pension income was $13 million lower, on a quarterly basis.", "Immediately after the merger announcement, we started on the integration, analysis and preparation. And, developed detailed plans for every synergy opportunity. We engaged outside advisers to help us in the certain areas. The billion dollar target includes both companies specific cost reduction and performance improvement targets of approximately $700 million, and the merger-related synergies target of $300 million.", "Over one half of the $1 billion target will come from our ongoing productivity and performance improvement programs across our manufacturing footprint, and cost savings from capital investments. Almost 30% will be from procurement opportunities. And, the remainder will be from manufacturing optimization and reductions from the elimination of duplicate corporate costs and support functions. The billion dollar performance improvement savings will be realized at about a third over each of the next three years.", "We expect to realize a run rate of a $150 million in savings by the end of September. The elimination of duplicate corporate expenses will be realized quickly. We have developed concrete plans behind each of these areas, and have pushed the savings goals down to each business and function. Everyone will be held accountable for realizing these targets. Total transaction related costs were approximately $115 million. And, the estimated cost for us to capture the merger-related synergies are approximately $100 million. We estimate 20% to 30% of this will be paid from pension plan assets.", "I want to highlight that the billion dollars is before inflation. Labor benefits and insurance expense accounts for approximately $3.5 billion per year. And, normal inflation on this category should be approximately $100 million per year. The balance of our inflation will depend on commodity price trends, and could add another $125 million to $175 million in inflation per year. We will update the investment community on our progress against our target, as part of our quarterly results.", "We bring a disciplined cost focus to the business and are instilling that view across 42,000 employees. We are currently rolling out allocations of the applicable corporate overhead cost to each business and cost center. And, we know from our past that it drives full accountability and visibility across the organization. By fully allocating costs, the businesses are able to challenge the corporate departments on their cost and spending. And, management can determine where the best returns and investments should be made, if at all.", "Our post-merger balance sheet is very strong, as opening leverage is approximately 2 times, and our maturities are very well spaced out. Both S&P and Moody's reaffirmed their ratings on WestRock at investment grade. Our $4.9 billion bank financing package has attractive terms. And, combined with our other facilities, provides us with more than $3.5 billion of current available liquidity to execute, on our disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy.", "With leverage at 2X and our stock price at these levels, we have an opportunity to move rather quickly, to increase our leverage toward our 2.25 times to 2.5 times leverage target. Our current debt mix is 62% fixed and 38% floating. Our combined average interest rate is about 4.7%. Our marginal cost to borrow on our available lines is less than 1.35%.", "Before turning back to Steve, let me provide you an overview of some of the key assumptions that will help you in your modeling of our September quarter. Although our purchase price accounting work is not yet finalized, $270 million is our current estimate of depreciation and amortization for the quarter. Of that, approximately $70 million is quarterly intangible amortization expense, or $280 million on an annual basis. This will flow through our SG&A line, and should be considered when making comparisons of our SG&A expense, versus peers.", "We will do everything we can to drive unnecessary costs out of our business. For example, we are actively working to sublease the entire New York Park Avenue office space, and will seek to set sublease currently available space in Richmond. We are evaluating other opportunities to sublease available space across our Company.", "Effective with our July 2 pension plan merger, we are approximately 109% funded on a GAAP basis, in our US plans, and are embarking on a de-risking liability-driven pension investment strategy that is approximately 80% bonds. The corresponding expected return on the asset portfolio is 5.87%, which is reducing our forecasted pension income to about $8 million for the quarter. By moving immediately on merging the pensions plans, we saved $14 million in pension contributions, that would have been due on July 15.", "We have provided a cost of goods sold breakout, which outlines our cost pools across our entire manufacturing footprint. In addition, we have provided 18 annual commodity consumption volumes to help you. The current estimated annual dollar spend across these eight categories is approximately $2.8 billion.", "As we think about our exposure to foreign currencies, we look at our geographic revenue mix overall. Which is 79% North American and 21% outside of this region. Of this 21%, approximately half is comprised of exports of containerboard and paperboard, that are priced primarily in US dollars. The remainder is sold in local currency.", "Our largest foreign currency exposures are related to the euro and the Brazilian Real. We estimate that he 10% strengthening of the dollar against these currencies would have a $30 million negative impact to EBT, on an annual basis. Back to you, Steve", "Steve Voorhees", "Thanks, Ward. Trends in most of our markets are stable to positive. This includes overall containerboard, paperboard and packaging markets. Raw materials prices are also relatively stable.", "With respect to the outlook for the September quarter, we expect that the performance trends we have seen over the past quarter will continue. And that, our success in the quarter will be influenced by how we perform and maintain our momentum, including capturing the opportunities available to us as a result of the merger.", "When we announced the merger on January 26, we said that, together, we are creating a global industry leader in consumer and corrugated packaging. A company with true competitive advantages, including an outstanding organization, a market focused customer centric strategy and scale. We said that we'd be leveraging the strengths of both companies into a larger, more balanced and more global, business that the combined company would have an enhanced presence in the marketplace that will provide substantial opportunities for profitable growth.", "We said that we'd have the financial strength and flexibility to enable this growth. All that remains true six months later, in fact, after six months, I feel even better about this combination, WestRock, than I did in January. We have a strong foundation and a near-term road map to capture the billion in merger-related synergy and performance improvement opportunities, by the end of FY18. We are very focused on cash flow generation, overall.", "Corrugated and Consumer Packaging are attractive businesses, where scale and differentiation matter. We offer a set of products, services and scale that can't be offered by any other company. This provides us the opportunity to grow. We have the cash flow available to invest for growth on a disciplined basis. And also, the ability to return the significant cash to stockholders, via dividends and share repurchases. I want to thank you for your time and interest.", "We will now turn the call over for Q&A. Operator, please open the lines.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mr. Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Sir, your line is open.", "Mark Weintraub", "Thank you. And, thank you for that thorough overview of the new entities, very informative. What I was hoping to get was, first of all, any sense as to the pacing on the share repurchase? Or, how we should think about how you're coming at the share repurchase program? And then, just two cash flow questions. One being, in terms of pension contributions going forward, are you now expecting any? And of what magnitude, if so? And then last, let me stop there.", "Steve Voorhees", "I'll let Ward respond to the pension question. With respect to share repurchases, we have our program out. There's a variety of ways we can go about implementing that, and just haven't come to a final conclusion yet.", "Ward Dickson", "With the pension plan, obviously with the merger of the US plans, we don't need to make contributions. We still have the partially unfunded pension plan in Candida, and we will be making contributions of around $35 million in the year.", "Mark Weintraub", "Okay. I'll get back in queue.", "Operator", "Alright, thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sir, your line is open.", "George Staphos", "Thanks everyone, and good morning. I guess the first question I had for you, in past quarters, you've provided and earnings-per-share guidance for the upcoming quarter. If you mentioned it here I missed it. If you did not mention it, I'm guessing it's because there's so many moving parts with write-ups, with the acquisition accounting, et cetera. That, it may be is not fruitful for you to do that. Could you comment to that end, whether you'll be providing quarterly earnings guidance on a going forward basis?", "And then, specific to the productivity goals and inflation, would it be fair to assume that, because of your actions, that the labor inflation, and to some degree even the commodity inflation, should trend lower in years 2 and 3 of the program, such that you maybe get some widening of spread, and improvement in earnings from that source, thanks.", "Steve Voorhees", "We did not provide guidance and you just hit the mark on why. We just haven't come to a conclusion about whether we'll provide revenue guidance going forward. With respect to the labor question, Ward, do you have thoughts on that?", "Ward Dickson", "George, if you look at the overall synergies and performance improvements within the billion dollar goal, labor is a component of it. We identified that the labor across the whole company, so that's both the SG&A pool and the manufacturing and indirect manufacturing expenses, $3.5 billion per year. It is a component of the synergy pool. But, as you can tell, the largest individual item in the synergy pool is the procurement savings that we're going to have, by having that combined leverage of the two companies. So I think trying to project what inflation and commodity price movements are going to be over the three-year period is hard. We just try to put a stake in the ground for you.", "George Staphos", "Ward, if I could just ask a follow-on, just on the guidance. Then, I'll turn it over. Historically, the fourth fiscal quarter was RockTenn's largest quarter. Would there be anything now, in terms of the mixture of the two businesses, supply chain, what have you, such that that would not be the case? Again, recognizing that there are going to be lots of moving parts in this particular quarter. Thank you.", "Ward Dickson", "As we look at the underlying performance of the business, some of the trends that Steve highlighted. I would say that we're seeing continuing into the fourth quarter. We will start to recognize some of the initial synergies, related to some of the corporate overhead pools. But again, the primary reason that we described for not giving guidance in the quarter was that, we truly want to close the books for a month. We've got a lot of moving pieces, as you described, with the opening balance sheet and the consolidation.", "George Staphos", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Philip Nadeau. Sir, your line is open.", "Philip Nadeau", "Good morning, strong quarter, congrats on that. You outpaced the market pretty nicely, on the corrugated site. How sustainable is that? And, do you start comping that benefit in Q4? And, any color in terms of how trends are shaking out in July would be great.", "Steve Voorhees", "I'll let Jim Porter respond to that.", "Jim Porter", "Good morning, Philip. We're pretty excited about the performance of our corrugated business, and the progress that we've made over the last number of months, we believe are solid and sustainable. Obviously, there's market variations that we have to adapt to. But, we've done tremendous work at changing the culture of our corrugated business, and investing in the assets. And, building a very execution-oriented manufacturing process. And, one focused on providing innovative solutions to our customers. That, we believe, is being received very well. I hope that gives some color, that supports our view.", "Philip Nadeau", "Got you. And Jim, I think last quarter, you guys were talking about how, in corrugated, you were going to build some inventory, and go into fiscal fourth quarter, you're going to draw it down. Can you provide any update on that front?", "Jim Porter", "The question is on containerboard inventories?", "Philip Nadeau", "Yes. I think if I remember correctly, on the last call, you mentioned you were going to build some inventory and fiscal 3Q and then draw it down in fiscal 4Q. Any update on that front would be helpful.", "Jim Porter", "Okay, exactly. Inventories are something that we micro-manage, if you will, to ensure that we can provide adequate supply to our internal packaging operations, as well as our customers. And, we've just completed a large downtime quarter. Being the last quarter. And so, our inventories dropped, as did the industry inventories dropped. As we reflect on inventories in general, I know there's a lot of press on the costs for current industry inventories, relative to the average 10-year inventories. And, we just think that's really not apples to apples, today. Examples being that, we acquired the Smurfit-Stone assets in 2011. And, they just had a very unsustainably low level of inventory. That was not capable of providing our internal packaging operations the ability to perform, with appropriate on-time delivery and supply chain costs that were sustainable.", "And so, we today focus our inventories on what is the optimal safety stock, doing supply chain math to try to manage that very crisply. And so, we think inventories are at a sustainable level. That is something that we will flex with changes in our mill operating uptime, and the conditions in the market relative to rail and truck availability et cetera.", "Philip Nadeau", "Okay. That's helpful. If I could sneak one in for Ward. If I heard you correctly, you're looking to potentially ramp up your leverage pretty quickly to that 2.25 times to 2.5 times. Is most of that going to be used for buybacks? Or, maybe some cushion for M&A? How should we be thinking about that? Thanks.", "Ward Dickson", "The 2.25X to 2.5X, and our capital allocation strategy, is one about balance. We have the authorization in place to be able to go ahead and execute around the share repurchase. And, we have the liquidity to do that, and to take advantage of acquisition opportunities as they arise. I think the message that we gave when we announced the strategy is, it's one of balance. We'll be able to execute on any of the levers.", "Philip Nadeau", "Okay, very hopeful. Good luck on the quarter, guys.", "Ward Dickson", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Mark Wilde from BMO Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open.", "Mark Wilde", "Good morning. Steve, I wondered just going back to this billion dollar number. If you could just give us a little color on how you think about the interplay between taking costs out, and actually dropping that to the bottom line, versus the ongoing cost reduction that you have to do to stay competitive in the business?", "Steve Voorhees", "Both of those factors are considered in the billion dollars. We have got some feedback that maybe the billion dollars might be light. I think a billion dollars is a lot of money, and if we can do that, that will be a tremendous performance. And, I think we are looking at trying to optimize the business. And, I want to be able to grow the business overtime. And so, that's the balance that we need to be looking at and will look at.", "Mark Wilde", "When you put it all together, how much of that billion do you think you can actually hold onto?", "Steve Voorhees", "I think the expectation is we - are you talking about from a -", "Mark Wilde", "From a margin standpoint, how much of that really is in margin, and that you can retain in margin?", "Steve Voorhees", "I really can't speculate on that because we're in a competitive business. A lot of companies are doing very similar at times. All I know is that, the billion dollars is the opportunity I see that WestRock has, today, as we said. And, I feel very good about our ability to do that. Okay. And Steve, one other question. I've been with you a few times over the last six or eight months, where you've talked about the importance, in transactions, of just getting the culture right from the get-go. You want to provide just a little color on what you're doing, right now, to the culture right? We've invested a lot of time integrating both organizations. I think both organizations are a lot more complementary and similar than I think a lot of people thought. We're not taking it for granted. We're investing a lot. The management's going out and identifying the issues which are out. And, we are addressing them.", "I'm very optimistic about the organization coming together. I prefaced, or made an initial comment, that we have got enthusiastic alignment about the aspiration that we have for WestRock and everywhere I've been, and I've been a lot of places over the last several months, that resonates very clearly across the organization.", "Mark Wilde", "Okay, great. Good luck in the coming quarters.", "Steve Voorhees", "Thank you, Mark.", "Operator", "Alright, thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Mr. Adam Josephson from KeyBanc. Sir, your line is open.", "Adam Josephson", "Thanks, good morning, everyone and congratulations on your solid performance of thus far. Jim or Steve just one on containerboard. Steve you said, or I believe earlier, that the linerboard market is tight. We've seen the export data, kraft linerboard exports up pretty significantly, year to date. And, obviously, prices are down to some extent. So, can you just reconcile the statement that the linerboard market is tight, with the significant increase we've seen in exports year to date?", "Steve Voorhees", "Go ahead, Jim.", "Jim Porter", "We have seen significant increases in export. And, we have a very tight linerboard environment in North America. Our market place is the world. We, of course, have a very strong position in the North American independent converter community. But, we also sell to most countries of the world. And, that's been our philosophy, to try to diversify our mix to those markets. And, we see solid demand in every one of them Relative to the currency impact of a strong US dollar, that does it have pressure on price. The good news is, is that price hasn't dropped at par with the currency changes. And, frankly, much of that change in currency-related price occurred in the last quarter of 2014, in the last two quarters of 2014. And, our current year at three quarters has been relatively solid. We think much of that impact is gone. We're seeing strong markets in the world and prices firming.", "Adam Josephson", "Just one follow-up to that. I appreciate that the global market is growing, but are you surprised that exports are up? Kraft linerboards are up 9%. I wouldn't think that global demand would be growing at that kind of rate.", "Jim Porter", "What we see is that virgin containerboard is very much in demand. The international markets of recycled containerboard, which trade at lower levels, the substitution has occurred. And so, the growth in agricultural markets of the world are being fueled by virgin containerboard. And, we don't see that surprising at all. And, frankly, that's our underlying premise for being heavily invested in that business.", "Adam Josephson", "Thanks. And, just one on OCC. Do you have any thoughts, long-term, as to where OCC is most likely to go? And, what implication do you think that would have on North American containerboard industry competitive dynamics?", "Steve Voorhees", "Great question. We have tried to, and always do, build trend-lines out into the future and the only thing for certain is they're usually wrong. What we see in the current marketplace that the global market has firmed. China has been somewhat sleepy for the last number of months and quarters. For the last three months, there was some firming. However, it's softened again. We think that generally the recovered-fiber markets are firm. We do not see any runaway trend occurring. Relative to long-term, it's a global market, both wood and recovered fiber. We'll likely have some upward inflationary trend, but we would guess those to be in balance, as recovery rates increase globally. And the marketplace plays out.", "Ward Dickson", "And, to the question of North American competitiveness we think the cost structure of the North American containerboard business is highly competitive with anywhere else in the world. And so, we like our position.", "Adam Josephson", "Thanks, a lot. Best of luck in the quarter.", "Jim Porter", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Alright, thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Sir, your line is open.", "Chip Dillon", "Yes, thank you very much, good morning, and congratulations on all the hard work that I know has been going on for a long time. Thanks also for the update on the integration issue. It's interesting. It seems like you guys are probably among the larger players. And, you can correct me, the least forward integrated into boxes. And yet, we've seen this trend in the last couple years of independent box plants, or at least the sheet feeders that provide them, being acquired by mill owners. I didn't know if that's, especially with the last year's West Coast mill purchase, if that's something that you would consider, as you think about growing the company, is more forward integration?", "Steve Voorhees", "Chip, yes we would. I think we'd look at opportunities to improve our business, and that would fit within that category.", "Chip Dillon", "Okay, got you. Could you talk a little bit about, you mentioned the tightness in kraft linerboard. And, the AF&PA reported that if you look just at craft linerboard, the US capacity is actually lower today than it was six years ago. I'm sure part of that was due to the Smurfit-Stone shutdowns and crisis. But, nonetheless, we've seen a big competitor announce a small increase in their system capacity over the next few years. Do you feel that there are still actions you can take, to free up kraft linerboard capacity in your system? And I asked that because you've already done quite a bit of work, on your system, in the wake of the Smurfit-Stone deal.", "Steve Voorhees", "I think we have opportunities to improve our overall system. I think it's kind of hard to speculate on what we'll do with respect to capacity, going forward. I think in our billion dollars, we do have capital across our entire system, to improve the operating performance.", "Chip Dillon", "I see. Thank you.", "Operator", "Alright, thank you. Our next question comes from Ms. Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Ma'am, your line is open.", "Debbie Jones", "Hi, good morning.", "Steve Voorhees", "Hi, Debbie.", "Debbie Jones", "I was wondering if you could help us understand your results in Brazil. You had a great quarter. Obviously, you\u2019re performing much better than the market. How much of this have to do with your competitive position and the investments that you've made down there?", "Steve Voorhees", "I think it has a lot to do with the investments that we've made. We had a very significant investment in the middle, and they've been knocking it out of the park. We've also focused on protein markets, which fit the product that we make. We've had good success there. And then, we've expanded regionally in different areas of the country, which has given us more position in the box market. That pretty much explains the performance. I will add, all that doesn't occur without people. And I went down there, I was very impressed with the organization they have in there. They fit extremely well into the overall WestRock system.", "Debbie Jones", "And, just one follow up. You said a pretty attractive dividend. How should we think about that, going forward, in terms of your dividend policy? Whether it be progressive, looking at a payout or cover ratio?", "Ward Dickson", "Debbie, this is Ward. Although we haven't given a payout ratio, we feel like we set a pretty attractive dividend, compared to the S&P 500 Index, and competitive with our peers. We look at it in combination with our overall capital allocation strategy, in the context of both our ability to invest in our business, take advantage of acquisition opportunities, and then to also pursue share repurchases, to manage within the target leverage ratio. I think we feel pretty comfortable with where we set it, and we think it's very attractive initial dividend level.", "Debbie Jones", "Thank you. I would agree, and I will turn it over.", "Operator", "Alright, thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Sir, your line is open.", "Scott Gaffner", "Thanks, good morning.", "Steve Voorhees", "Good morning, Scott.", "Scott Gaffner", "Hey, Steve. Just wanted to dig a little bit deeper on the projected synergy, or overall cost savings run rates. I think you said you would be at $150 million by the end of September, on a run rate basis. Is that just since July 1? Or, is that for the full fiscal year that you would get to that run rate, and is that mostly around the SG&A savings?", "Steve Voorhees", "What we started to do is, we started to form the teams and do the planning. We started to evaluate costs from the beginning of the calendar year. And so, It's the accumulation of efforts that has been taking place. And just remember, it's the combination of the synergies, and just the ongoing productivity efforts, that we have across the whole organization. What we did highlight is that, we will recognize a portion of the SG&A and infrastructure cost, related to some of the duplicate corporate costs, pretty quickly. And, that is contributing to the run rate. Plus, also, the procurement synergies. We're moving very quickly on sourcing activities within the combined WestRock. And, we'll start to achieve some of those gains as we exit the calendar year.", "Scott Gaffner", "Okay. And, when you look at the capital you outlined four 2016, the $850 million, anything you've identified on the $500 million around potential capital avoidance? Where, maybe some assets were over invested in? Maybe, could that come down in 2017?", "Steve Voorhees", "No. There might be someplace, but I can't think of anywhere. What we did, given the circumstances, do a very complete job of our capital planning. And, I think we are very measured in our approach, and I think that's just what we came up with.", "Scott Gaffner", "Okay. And just lastly, given the combined entities only been together for about one month, have you had any customers come to your proactively around cross-selling opportunities? Where, maybe, you didn't have certain substrates before? Has that come to fruition yet?", "Steve Voorhees", "I'm going to let Bob Beckler respond to that.", "Bob Beckler", "Scott, that's a great question. It's been one of the pleasant surprises of the merger, right out of the gates. We're seeing it all over with customer interests. It really falls into three categories. As you pointed out, just the sheer breadth of offer that we have in our packaging platform, corrugated folding carton, beverage, packaging dispensing systems and merchandising displays. Also, we have scale in all of these packaging segments. And so, we are number 1 and number 2 in each of those that I just listed. And then, finally, there's a recognition that these have interplay. That they are connected.", "And so, we're having a lot of dialogue with customers around how to connect together our capabilities. Not just around the packaging products themselves, but our ability to work with them in their facilities, to bring out the complete value that the packaging can offer. So, summing it all up, the answer is a big yes and we're very excited about the potential.", "Scott Gaffner", "Great, thanks for all the details.", "Operator", "Aright, thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Sir, your line is open.", "Antony Pettinari", "Good morning and congratulations on the debut. Prior to the merger, the Specialty Chemicals spin was already in the works. As you look at the portfolio today, is it fair to say that you\u2019re pleased with the WestRock portfolio as it stands? Or, do you think over the next few months, there might be additional businesses you might reevaluate, as to whether they're a fit for WestRock, longer term?", "Steve Voorhees", "We're comfortable with the portfolio as it currently stands.", "Antony Pettinari", "Okay. And then just following up on Scott's question, regarding the billion dollar target and performance improvements and you're $850 million CapEx guidance for next year, as you move beyond 2016, would you anticipate CapEx would ever need to ramp up meaningfully to hit that billion dollar target? Or, do you think you can achieve that target while keeping CapEx around that $850 million level?", "Steve Voorhees", "We're looking at a number of projects. And, I think they generally fit within the capital that we've had. Out there, I think we always look at our system and try to find opportunities to be able to invest capital wisely. I think the premise is that, we can do that within the capital that we outlined.", "Antony Pettinari", "Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just one final one. As you pursue the performance improvements, are there any large IT systems integrations, our IT rollouts, that will be required to tie together RockTenn and MeadWestvaco's financial and manufacturing systems?", "Ward Dickson", "Certainly, from an infrastructure point of view, there is. So, there's the opportunity to consolidate data centers across the combined footprint. And then, we do have the opportunity to harmonize some of the applications in our North American mill portfolio. And we have included those in some of our plans, over the course of the three-year period.", "Antony Pettinari", "Okay. That's helpful. I will turn it over.", "Operator", "Alright, thank you. And our next question comes from Mr. Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo. Sir, your line is open.", "Chris Manuel", "Good morning, gentlemen. Just a couple quick ones, because I know we are deep in the call. But, if I could come back to the - you gave a capital outlook next year of $850 million and that's inclusive of what you're doing this year, for capital return projects and other elements. What might the spend be, to get the rest of the billion dollars? i.e. maybe the $300 million of deal-related synergies, et cetera. Should we think of something as a one- to two-year payback, that's required to get those, that comes out? So, an idea of what other cost expenses are. The next cadence of that, for the next, call it, next 12 months or 18 months.", "Steve Voorhees", "Within the $100 million there's some of the expenses related to the IT projects, that I described. For which, we'll be able to yield some meaningful savings, again, data center consolidation and other opportunities. I think the other components of it are really, of the billion dollars, are the ongoing productivity programs that we have in both organizations. That includes investments in capital, for a return generating projects. Within the $300 million, the three key components of the $300 million were null and converting footprint optimization, SG&A and infrastructure cost reductions and then the procurement organization. Getting the leverage across the combined spend of the two companies. There really isn't a lot of other incremental cost inside the $100 million that we described. So, we had severance related costs and we have some capital related costs on the IT side.", "Chris Manuel", "I appreciate that. What I'm asking is, to get that $300 million in savings - so, for cash that you are going to have gone out the next 12 months or 18 months, for severance, manufacturing, optimization and other pieces. Should we assume a three-year payback, that it's $100 million then? Or, something like that? Or, how should we think about that?", "Ward Dickson", "Again [Multiple Speakers] a cash flow model. And, we're looking for some of the big inflow/outflow components.", "Steve Voorhees", "Again, we described the - out of the $100 million required to capture the synergies, we described - a portion of it is going to be paid from the pension plan assets. And then, the remainder of it will be paid, I think, over the course of the first 18 months to 24 months of the integration.", "Chris Manuel", "Thanks. That's helpful. I might have missed part of that. The second question I had was, as you talked about the ramp-up of share repurchase, can you maybe help us with what might or might not be, from a timing perspective, the advantage of beginning our share repurchase program either ahead? Or, the advantage/disadvantage of waiting until after you've executed the chemical spin to do that.", "Steve Voorhees", "I don't think the chemical spin is a factor in how we think about share repurchase.", "Chris Manuel", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. We have Mr. Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research again in the line. Sir, your line is open.", "Mark Weintraub", "Thank you. I was hoping to just come back and maybe get a little bit more help, if you could, on the set up for the coming quarter. One question was, I see you have the 12 month EBITDA for MeadWestvaco and RockTenn separately. Do you have the third, what the most recent, quarter for MeadWestvaco was? And is it fair to, essentially, just use the base of those two combined? You provided guidance on a number of the other measures. But then, if we were to look at what we would've expected RockTenn, separately, to have done one quarter to the next, MeadWestvaco one quarter to the next, would that get us to a number? Or, might there be some other drivers that we need to be conscious of, that can affect where the outcome would be? I realize that it may simply be there are no other outcomes, and it's not an important question. I just wanted to make sure I was not missing something.", "Ward Dickson", "Some of the obvious other drivers that you have to look at is, any changes in commodity cost, sequentially. Any changes in exchange rates, sequentially. But Steve, I don't know if you have anything to add?", "Steve Voorhees", "Mark, I think you outlined the questions and I think you've got relevant questions. I think you're very good at going through our disclosure and putting together your model. I think what you've got, I think you should be able to work with.", "Mark Weintraub", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Okay. Speakers we still have one question on queue. This comes from Mr. Richard Leach from RLR Capital Management. Sir, your line is open.", "Richard Leach", "Thank you for taking my question. What do you estimate the fully diluted share count will be for the September quarter?", "Steve Voorhees", "$266 million.", "Richard Leach", "Great. That's it. Thank you very much.", "Steve Voorhees", "If there are no other questions, I very much appreciate your staying on this lengthy call. And, I appreciate your listening to the prepared remarks and look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you everyone. That concludes today's conference.

These include our WestRock S4 filing, the most recent 10-Ks and 10-Qs, followed by our predecessor companies, the recent Form-10 filed to enable the tax-free spend of our specialty chemicals business.", "We\u2019ll refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. You may have noticed in our press release and on page 19 of our earnings call deck that we provided a comparison of our results for the September quarter of 2015 to the September quarter of 2014. This comparison uses the reported results of predecessor companies as adjusted for our new segment and other merger-related accounting items, including application of a consistent method for allocating corporate cost. We\u2019ve provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation that\u2019s available on our website.", "We performed well in our first quarter of operations as WestRock. The most appropriate place for me to start is by thanking all of my WestRock coworkers who have continued to take care of our customers, operate safely, and deliver strong results in a competitive business environment all while working extremely hard to take advantage of the many opportunities that we have as a newly merged company.", "We continue to have enthusiastic alignment across the company about our aspiration to be the global industry leader in consumer and corrugated packaging markets. We\u2019re making significant strides in areas that are driving value from the merger, including the integration of our organizations, the realization of the merger-related synergies and performance improvements, the opportunities we have to provide a broad range of paper and packaging solutions to help our customers succeed in their markets.", "We reported $0.93 of adjusted earnings per share and generated $268 million of free cash flow after adding back the after-tax cost of transaction fees and restructuring cost. We executed exceptionally well in our packaging businesses. Our North American box business increased volumes by 2.9% on a per day basis in the quarter. This compares to a less than 1% increase for the industry over the same timeframe.", "Our containerboard mill system is operating efficiently. The North American corrugated packaging business earned adjusted EBITDA margins of 20%. The corrugated packaging business in Brazil is operating exceptionally well and earned adjusted EBITDA margins of 28% in the September quarter.", "Our consumer mill system is also operating well, and we\u2019re implementing published price increases across the recycled branch. There is positive momentum in folding carton, home health and beauty, and merchandising displays, and I\u2019ll have more color on each of those shortly. Specialty chemical sales of activated carbon and asphalt additives were at record levels. But those gains were more than offset by lower sales to oil fuel drilling and industrial markets.", "EBITDA margins were 24.9%. Ingevity\u2019s initial Form-10 was filed on October 6. We\u2019re targeting an approximate March 1, 2016 spend date. We\u2019re progressing toward our $1 billion in annualized synergy and performance improvements to be achieved by the end of fiscal 2018. We generated annualized run rate savings at quarter end in excess of $150 million, and we expect annualized run rate savings of, at least, $400 million by the end of fiscal year 2016.", "We\u2019re executing on our disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy. We ended the quarter at 2.08 leverage, slightly under our stated target leverage ratio of 2.25 to 2.50 times. We completed the SP Fiber acquisition on October 1. The Dublin, Georgia mill is an excellent asset and provides a valuable product mix and adds logistical flexibility within our system.", "The Newberg, Oregon newsprint and containerboard machines were idled in our first month of operation, due to market conditions in newsprint and our need to balance supply and demand in our containerboard mill system. We continue to expect performance improvements in excess of $50 million over three years for the transaction to be accretive in the second-half of fiscal 2016.", "On October 12, we announced the formation of a joint venture with Grupo Gondi for our packaging businesses in Mexico. Gondi is a high-quality paperboard manufacturer and packaging converter for many local and global brand name customers. Our partnership will help grow our presence in the attractive Mexico market. We expect to begin operations as a joint venture as soon as we receive Mexican regulatory approval, which we expect will take 4 to 6 months.", "We repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $60.20. We were and continue to be limited in the number of shares we can buy as a result of our need to maintain, at least, a 50.1% ownership interest by legacy and WB stockholders as of July 1, 2015. This continuity of ownership is necessary to preserve the tax-free separation of the specialty chemicals business from WestRock. We have been and are able to buy back shares up to the exact overlapping investor ownership of our predecessor companies at the specific fund level as of July 1. We have sufficient repurchase opportunity available to us to operate within our target leverage ratio range.", "I will now provide more details on our overall results and performance in each business segment before turning it over to Ward, and then I\u2019ll come back to provide thoughts on the outlook for our December quarter.", "When we compare WestRock\u2019s results in the September quarter to combined recast results in the same quarter of last year, sales declined by $203 million, or 5%. This decline was largely comprised of $141 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations and $44 million of revenue from the European tobacco converting business sold earlier in the year.", "Adjusted segment EBITDA, net of corporate cost, declined by $80 million compared to last year, due to foreign currency translation impacts of $26 million. The absence of the $23 million gain we recorded last year due to the write-up of spare parts inventory in our mill system and $26 million in the lower pension income. WestRock\u2019s credit agreement EBITDA and EBITDA margins are at last 12 months are in excess of $2.5 billion and 16.9% respectively.", "Let\u2019s turn to each of our segments. WestRock\u2019s corrugated packaging team performed well in the September quarter, especially considering the headwinds we faced in the quarter from a weaker global economy and a stronger U.S. dollar. Net sales declined by $75 million, or 3.7%. On a constant currency basis, sales were up by $20 million, or 1%. Of the $95 million in currency headwinds, about one-half was in Brazil, one-third was due to the Canadian dollar, and most of the rest was the Mexican peso.", "Segment income was lowered by $39 million, with $23 million of that related to the write-up of spare parts last year and $15 million related to currency impacts in Canada, Brazil, and India. Overall, segment EBITDA margin was 19.4% with our North American corrugated margin at 20% and our Brazil margin at 28%. As I referenced earlier, our North American box volumes increased by 2.9% compared to last year, and box pricing in North America was stable. Our box system has been very successful in the market by focusing on quality and on-time delivery in combination with innovation that\u2019s relevant to our customers\u2019 needs.", "This approach has enabled us to retain existing customers and grow our customer base over time, including gains in the quarter with customers for protein and processed foods, snacks, dairy, and e-commerce. Our success has been and will be defined by how well we operate on a day-to-day basis in each of our plants and with each of our customers. The scale of the WestRock organization has supported our local success to our capital investment, our investment in people, and connecting our coworkers so as to make it easier to share knowledge on how to succeed across the company and with our customers. We\u2019ve continued our volume growth in October by increasing sales on a per day basis by more than 3% over last year.", "Our North American corrugated shipments in the quarter declined by 15,000 tons compared to the June quarter, and 57,000 tons, or 2.7% compared to last year. Export volumes declined by 29,000 tons compared to last year. Our overall export pricing declined $9 per ton compared to the June quarter and $37 per ton compared to last year. Prices of containerboard to third-party domestic customers have been within a $5 per ton range since the summer of 2014.", "We took approximately 76,000 tons of downtime during the quarter, all except 3,000 tons being economic downtime. In October, we took about 95,000 tons of downtime in our corrugated mill system, with approximately 55,000 tons being economic downtime, the remainder being maintenance downtime at our Florence mill. We\u2019ve consistently operated our system in a way that balances production with our customer demand. We plan and schedule this balance on an ongoing basis and take actions as needed, including slowbacks, economic downtime, maintenance downtime, and permanent closures.", "Our goal is to pursue the actions that we believe will optimize our mill system thus producing the best economic and operating results for WestRock and our customers. We don\u2019t publicly announce our actions. We communicate our plans to the employees, customers, and suppliers who will be most directly impacted. This past month is an example of this planning and execution as we took action on several facilities. With the October 1 completion of the SP Fiber transaction, we were able to reassess our overall mill system to determine the optimal way to meet our customers\u2019 demand.", "Following this assessment, we announced indefinite downtime in both Fernandina Beach and Uncasville to immediately match our production to customers\u2019 orders. The following week we announced the permanent closure of the 310,000 ton Coshocton, Ohio mill, which will occur in late November to provide an orderly mill closure and consumption of raw materials such as chemicals, wood, and recovered fiber. The closure of Coshocton will reduce our annual operating cost by $33 million and avoid an additional $4 million annually in maintenance capital expenditures.", "The same week we announced an indefinite idling of our Newberg mill due to the unprofitable nature of the newsprint business and an inadequate order book on containerboard and bag reds [ph]. The mill will be idled in mid-November. We\u2019ve retained the optionality on the two excellent paper machines at Newberg in the event west coast demand warrants a restart. All of these actions have been well planned and executed and went according to our expectations.", "When we take economic downtime, we communicate that it is indefinite because the period of downtime may change with market conditions or lead to a permanent closure. We will continue to operate our system focused on our customers. Our plan is to take 114,000 tons of maintenance downtime in our corrugated mills during the December quarter. The Fernandina Beach paper machine has been restarted. The Huntsville mill is being restarted mid-month as planned to meet our customer demand. We\u2019re currently operating with 56,000 tons more inventory than we operated with one year ago.", "This additional inventory has helped improve on-time delivery and customer satisfaction with both our internal and external box plan customers, and has also reduced logistics cost. These benefits far outweigh the carrying cost of increased investment and inventory. Based on our forecasted sales and major maintenance and capital downtime plan, our containerboard inventories will gradually build an additional 30,000 tons from the end of September until they peak in January/February timeframe. Then we would expect them to return to our current level over the following few months.", "In Brazil the economic situation continues to be challenging, and our great team in the regions managed to continue to deliver very strong results, including adjusted EBITDA margins of 28.2% and sales growth of 10% on a local currency basis. While industry box demand declined by more than 5%, we grew box volume by 3% year-over-year with strength in proteins, produce, and export markets. In September our mill in Brazil set new production and shipment records.", "The interaction between our North America and Brazilian corrugated team has benefited both businesses to been able to drive improved productivity at our mills and box plants. In 2016, GDP in Brazil is expected to decline by approximately 2%, and industrial production is expected to decline by approximately 6%. While our corrugated business in Brazil is not immune to these challenges, we expect to continue to perform well due to our high-quality assets, customer service, and the differentiation of our virgin-based paper and packaging offerings.", "In the Consumer Packaging segment, overall results reflected good commercial and operational execution in the face of some difficult macro headwinds related to the stronger U.S. dollar. Net sales in the segment declined $140 million, or 8%, when compared to last year. This includes $37 million of negative impact from currency. Adjusted segment EBITDA was $14 million lower due to $8 million of foreign exchange impact and $4 million from the sale of the European tobacco business. Segment EBITDA margins were 15.6%.", "In the paperboard markets, our SBS food service volumes grew and our general folding carton and food markets are doing well. Industry SBS backlogs are 393,000 tons, somewhat lower than the 454,000 tons at the same time last year. Our backlogs are 3.5 weeks. We\u2019re making very good progress integrating the Carolina brand that we acquired earlier this year. Sales during the quarter were at a rate equivalent to 180,000 tons per year, and we expect to fully transition manufacturing to our facilities by the end of December.", "One of the first opportunities from the merger was to integrate SBS tons into our folding carton system and we\u2019re already more than halfway to achieving a full annual run rate of 50,000 tons by the end of December. During the quarter, these domestic SBS shipments more than offset softer exports for tobacco and liquid packaging grades. Industry backlogs for coated recycled board remained strong at approximately 165,000 tons, which is more than 40% higher than this time last year.", "WestRock\u2019s CRB backlogs are greater than 4% \u2013 f our weeks. We are moving production of our millennium board product from our Dallas and Strasburg mills to the Mahrt mill. We\u2019re backfilling both Dallas and Strasburg with additional CRB business. Demand for CNK remains solid, and our backlogs are nearly 4 weeks. Mill shipments grew by more than 3%, supported by growth from our beverage system.", "In North America, we largely offset declines in carbonated volumes with gains with our larger brewer customers, continued growth with craft brewers, and gains in water. In Europe, we saw stronger sales with our larger brewer customers. On the Asia-Pacific region, we saw improvement in carbonated soft drinks and dairy packaging. Our broader folding carton business also performed extremely well with share gains in new business in categories such as on-the-go foods, offsetting declines in areas such as cereal.", "Our general folding carton volumes were up 2% during the quarter, a fifth straight quarter of year-over-year growth. Our operational performance in our carton facilities was also strong with better plant loading and efficiency gains. Our home health and beauty business improved income and margins due to favorable mix from sales of trigger sprayers and healthcare dispensing systems, as well as productivity gains.", "And in our merchandising displays business, we saw a strong rebound with quarterly earnings up 55% over the prior year. After a challenging year that included some sales decline, we\u2019re seeing signs of growth and a strengthening market for promotional displays. Our decisions over the last couple of years to strategically invest capital to lower our cost has had a significant positive impact.", "We\u2019ve invested in our innovation platform and that\u2019s supporting our growth in new markets, including recently earning awards of new business that helped end the year on a very positive note. Many of our customers are learning more about our capabilities. We\u2019ve taken advantage of these opportunities to discuss our full product line and to learn about our customers\u2019 objectives, so we can develop paper and packaging solutions to help our customers meet their objectives.", "Specialty Chemicals business continues to perform well in the face of the slowdown in drilling and other industrial activity. Adjusted EBITDA margins remain very attractive at 24.9%, even if sales declined by $26 million compared to last year. Ingevity is starting up a new activated carbon plant in China this quarter and expanding our pine chemicals plant in Brazil at the first of the year. The activated carbon plant in China will provide needed capacity for a global system that supports the growing automotive sector. We\u2019re making good progress in qualifying the new production with our automotive customers in Asia and beyond, and expect sales to ramp up in the first-half of next year.", "The December quarter is seasonally the softest quarter for specialty chemicals. This is principally due to the winter slowdown in the road paving activity. We expect continued challenges in the oilfield sector, which impacts the segment sales levels and margins. I\u2019m very pleased that both Michael Wilson and John Fortson have joined Ingevity as CEO and CFO, respectively. They both bring tremendous and highly relevant experience to the business. We have confidence in their ability to lead Ingevity through these challenges and into a period of growth as an independent company. The spinoff of Ingevity is moving forward. The initial Form-10 was filed and we\u2019re targeting an approximate March 1, 2016, spin date.", "The land and development business continues to make good progress on their major projects in the Charleston region. The business had a fantastic quarter from a revenue standpoint with $45 million in revenue, including a $34 million gain related to the 68\u2013 I mean, the sale for $34 million related to the 6,800-acre site that Volvo acquired to build their new U.S. manufacturing facility. But due to the impact of purchase price accounting revaluing their existing projects to fair value, they lost $3 million on a GAAP basis.", "The step-up in book value had a $15 million negative impact on the segment income in the quarter. This marking to fair market value of our land portfolio in this business will reduce future profitability on existing projects, but does not impact future cash flows. As part of the valuation work, we have developed a project-by-project valuation of the partnership, which for our share is over $400 million. The experienced team in this business is executing on a plan to maximize this potential value. We\u2019re considering ways to monetize that value at a faster pace.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ward Dickson. Ward?", "Ward Dickson", "Thank you, Steve. Looking at our segment EBITDA, the productivity initiatives we have in place are working to offset inflation and FX. Productivity and synergies drove $60 million in earnings improvement. FX was a negative $26 million headwind which \u2013 with much of that in Europe and Brazil. And the total impact of inflation of labor and commodities for the segments and corporate was $20 million. The change in labor and benefits was approximately $29 million, and there was $9 million of combined deflation in commodity and other cost categories. The total impact of price and mix changes was minimal in the quarter.", "Corrugated packaging had positive price mix variance in part due to stable domestic box pricing, higher prices in Brazil, lower volumes of exports and domestic tons shipped, and an increase in the higher margin box shipments. There was a some decline in price and mix in the consumer packaging grades and specialty chemicals. Non-cash pension income was $26 million lower than last year due to, among other things, lower return on asset assumptions as we derisk our pension plans.", "The nonrecurring amount of $29 million includes $23 million from last year\u2019s spare parts gains that didn\u2019t recur this year. We made significant progress during our first quarter as WestRock toward our $1 billion synergy and productivity improvement target. We entered the quarter at a run rate of $75 million in savings and exited at an annualized run rate in excess of $150 million, which exceeded our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. This is a significant objective that will take a lot of work over the next three years to capture.", "Our entire organization is focused on meeting these objectives, and we have consistent monitoring and processes in place to make sure we stay on track, so we are confident in our ability to reach $1 billion by the end of fiscal 2018. We estimate that we will be at an annualized run rate of, at least, $400 million by the end of the fiscal year 2016. Our total SG&A costs for the quarter were $429 million, or 11% of sales. However, this total includes $64 million in ongoing merger and acquisition-related intangible amortization costs that flow through the $281 million depreciation and amortization line on our cash flow.", "Excluding intangible amortization, our SG&A costs are running at 9.4% of sales and will trend lower as we execute on our synergy and performance improvement program. We have completed our work to allocate corporate costs to the appropriate business units all the way down to the costs in our level. The full cost allocation brings further visibility into spending and business unit profitability.", "When comparing legacy RockTenn and MWV approximately 70% of RockTenn\u2019s corporate costs were allocated to the business units, and MWV was approximately 30% allocated. There was also some geography changes in the allocation market at some legacy MWV manufacturing site costs for non-production activities in the amount of $18 million were moved from cost of goods sold to SG&A.", "And as Steve said, we have included Slide 19 that provides a reconciliation of reported to recast segment income and EBITDA for Q4 FY14 for comparability purposes. We ended the quarter with $5.6 billion in reported debt, and included in that figure is approximately $340 million in fair value step-up to the market value of the legacy MWV data. The notional amount of what we owe under our debt obligations are approximately $5.3 billion.", "Our balance sheet is in great shape as we have $3.4 billion in available liquidity to support our strategy and very few maturities over the next several years. Our leverage ratio ended the quarter at 2.08 times. Our pension plans are in great shape, and we ended the fiscal year with almost $400 million in combined GAAP funded status surplus in our qualified U.S. and Canadian pension plans. The U.S. plans were overfunded by more than $500 million, and the Canadian plans were underfunded by more than $100 million. The overfunding in the U.S. plans gives us options as we think about derisking our balance sheet.", "Slide #13 has a number of key financial items to help in modeling our performance. Depreciation and amortization will continue to be approximately $285 million on a quarterly basis, and of that total intangibles amortization is approximately $70 million. Our CapEx is still estimated at $850 million for the full-year. The pension income of $8 million represents both the qualified and non-qualified plan amounts. Our book tax rate should be in the range of 33% to 35% for the December quarter.", "The September quarter effective tax rate of 29% was lower than our forecast due to discrete items primarily at the state tax level. We\u2019re planning scheduled maintenance downtime within our corrugated mill system of 114,000 tons during the quarter. Other items incorporated in our tax position also included $21.5 million of non-tax deductible restructuring fees.", "Cash pension contributions into our qualified pension plans are approximately $37 million in fiscal 2016, with almost all of that going into our Canadian plans. Our non-qualified or surplans will require additional cash funding of approximately $13 million this fiscal year. We have $115 million in state, federal, and foreign NOLs and $213 million in AMT and other federal credits.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Steve.", "Steve Voorhees", "Thanks, Ward. Looking to the immediate future there is a number of items that will impact our performance in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter. We\u2019ll see benefits from our performance improvement initiatives in our domestic box and folding carton businesses continue to do well compared to the market. Energy prices are lower, which is a positive for us. There is three less shipping days this quarter, and the December quarter historically has lower seasonal sales volumes than the September quarter.", "Maintenance and economic downtime will have a negative earnings impact. The euro and Brazilian real have both softened from September averages, and we expect to return to normal tax rates. Considering all of these items in the quarter, we expect sales and earnings to be lower in the December quarter as compared to last quarter.", "Looking further out, WestRock aspires to be the global leader in corrugated and consumer packaging. The first step for WestRock to achieve this aspiration is to combine and integrate organizations and in the process to capture $1 million in merger-related efficiencies and productivity improvements. We\u2019re on the road to capture this opportunity over the next three years. We\u2019ve made a lot of good progress in our business in just four months. We\u2019ve made progress building our culture at WestRock, progress making our operations more efficient, and more importantly progress teaming with our packaging customers to grow their share in the marketplace.", "While paper and packaging are very attractive businesses, the global economy, a strong U.S. dollar, and intense competition challenge us across our businesses. We are responding to these challenges with urgency, both to deliver short-term results, but also to keep our eye on the long-term opportunity we have within our sites. I remain enthusiastic about the opportunities that are ahead of us, and believe we\u2019re making excellent progress in the long-term value accretion opportunities we have as WestRock.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Jim, Bob, Ward, and I are now ready to take your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now being the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] One moment please for our first question. Our first question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.", "George Staphos", "Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. My two questions are going to center around consumer. I guess, the first question I had broadly, is there a way to quantify what kind of benefit you expect to get from the insourcing of Carolina? And for that matter the integration benefit you mentioned in cartons I think is something to the tune of 50,000 tons, and how that will begin to play out in the quarters?", "Steve Voorhees", "The integration of Carolina, we\u2019re going to begin producing those as rapidly as we can. We think we\u2019ll be up by the end of the December quarter. So right now we\u2019re at a run rate of 180,000 tons. So you take the incremental benefit of that times incremental margin and this can really speak to pricing and margin with respect to that. And it\u2019s pretty much the same song second verse on the folding carton business. I think, we have integrated that. I think in October, we, in fact, integrated 4,000 to 5,000 tons into our system already. So we\u2019re well on our way to the 50,000 tons which we said in the comments, we\u2019ll be at 50,000 tons by the end of December.", "George Staphos", "Steve, just point of clarification, I missed this. Are you currently at the 50,000 tons run rate right now, or are you going to there by the end of the quarter?", "Steve Voorhees", "We said we would be there by the end of the quarter. I saw some information in October, I think we\u2019re just about there now. But now is close to the end of the quarter.", "George Staphos", "Okay. Second question again around consumer, a couple of parts to it. With carton volumes up and merchandising strong certainly versus our model, do you think that we\u2019re finally seeing the pick-up in the consumer we\u2019ve been waiting for, it seems like for a long time. And related if you can, do you have any shipment statistics for all of the boxboard grades within consumer? Thank you.", "Steve Voorhees", "We don\u2019t have the shipment statistics for the boxboard kind of grades currently at hand. I think we\u2019re looking at it through a higher disclosure work, I think it\u2019s just open as to what it would provide those in the future.", "As far as trends in the market, it\u2019s hard to talk about a turnaround, but our volumes have been very strong in folding as we said. And on display, I think, we have seen a noticeable pick up in promotional activity from many of our customers. I think that has been noticeable and that has helped us drive the results that we\u2019ve talked about in this quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the lie of Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.", "Mark Weintraub", "Thank you. A couple of questions on the containerboard side. The first thing, I appreciate the details on the decisions you made on the footprint. There was a little bit of confusion there. I realize is that the reports were coming from the media, and so again the clarification from you is very helpful. But people were a little bit uncertain as to why the two mills they were \u2013 at least, through the media it was conveyed as indefinite closures and then fairly quickly that the mills were back on. And the outside view is that it\u2019s fairly unusual and maybe that\u2019s just not understanding how you guys typically convey information, et cetera. But if there\u2019s anything you can do to kind of clarify what was going on, that would be helpful.", "Steve Voorhees", "Okay. So I\u2019m going to let Jim Porter respond to that.", "James Porter", "Good morning, Mark. First of all, we have a large system with 16 mills now. and we operate that system very focused on providing our customers with good service, on-time delivery, and superior products, while balancing our supply with demand. And so we\u2019re constantly in a situation of designing the optimal portfolio and production capacity to meet that demand. And with the addition of the SP Fiber acquisition, which we were delighted to close October 1, gave us the opportunity to really reassess our containerboard system and to make some important moves utilizing those excellent assets at Dublin to better optimize our supply capability to our customers and improve our cost structure.", "So we were able to immediately take some capacity \u2013 production capacity out with the indefinite idling of the Fernandina Beach paper machine 3 and the Uncasville facilities, followed quickly by the announcement of the permanent closure of the Coshocton mill, which takes sometime to properly close in order to provide an orderly shutdown and to optimally consume chemicals, raw materials, fiber, wood, et cetera. And we also then followed that same week with the indefinite idling of the Newberg facility because of the weakness of the newsprint markets and to again balance our supply/demand scenario.", "So all of those decisions were executed to improve our capability to serve our customers and to improve our cost structure. We now are able to bring back the Fernandina Beach facility, which is an excellent paper machine producing high-quality virgin containerboard for our domestic and international markets. And the Uncasville recycled mill will also return. So that\u2019s \u2013 we operated that balancing in a way that supported our customers well and improved our cost structure, and that\u2019s the types of activities you\u2019ll see us focusing on in the future.", "Mark Weintraub", "Okay, great. And so am I right to interpret that? So the initial moves were on the indefinite closure on the two facilities, which then were restarted. It was a fluid situation and it depended on what was happening with some of the other facilities had an influence on what the status of those initial moves were ultimately going to be?", "James Porter", "Exactly. As I shared we\u2019re always in a position of balancing supply/demand through a combination of maintenance and capital downtimes that you will see we reported in this last quarter we only had 3,000 tons of maintenance downtime in the September quarter, whereas in the prior quarter, it was a little over 100,000 tons of maintenance downtime. And we\u2019ve just shared than in the December quarter we\u2019ll have 114,000 tons of maintenance downtime.", "So you can see within our system the balancing of capacity with demand is one in which we use the levers of maintenance downtime, flowbacks on certain paper machines, and the indefinite idling of others and in some cases permanent idling. But we have 16 mills that are operated in a way that we manage those paper machines production to demand.", "Steve Voorhees", "And Mark, the English language is a kind of just the English language and people interpret the same words differently. I think when we say indefinite we just mean not definite. And because we really don\u2019t want to create expectations that are \u2013 we don\u2019t want to create unnecessary expectations. So when we said indefinite, I think we\u2019ve had a meaning, which I think just was not \u2013 was picked up differently than, at least, the communication that we had. But I think Jim has covered the logic. And I think that\u2019s about all we can say on that.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Chi from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Alex Chi", "Hey, good morning, everyone.", "Steve Voorhees", "Good morning, yes.", "Alex Chi", "Couple of questions. So just looking at the North American containerboard segment, you actually provided specific earnings numbers for that segment as part of corrugated. And as I look at the September quarter, it didn\u2019t show the improvement that we saw in the first three quarters of the fiscal year. And I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s anything else in the number that resulted in that. I know it had a really good year, so was there some incremental incentive compensation that was paid out at the mill and converting level, or and anything else that maybe was in this quarter that didn\u2019t show up in the previous ones?", "Ward Dickson", "We did have some sequential increases from Q3 to Q4 and our fiber costs have been moderating. So on a year-over-year basis, we certainly were having dramatic benefits and reduced OCC, and they actually increased sequentially from Q3 to Q4. And we sold fewer tons.", "Alex Chi", "Right. And just on that question around the tons and also demand, so your box shipments are up 3%, which is the majority of the tons. You said your exports were down to get the number in the 30s, but that would sort of imply a very material drop off in tons to domestic customers. Can you talk to that a little bit and what\u2019s happening there?", "And then just as a follow-on on demand, you said October shipments were up 3% this year. Can you say what October was up last year, the genesis is being, I mean, are you putting up 3% on top of really good growth from last year? And I will stop here and turn it over. Thank you.", "Steve Voorhees", "I will let Jim talk about the domestic paperboard transition. But the box business has been performing very well on a volumetric basis for the past year. What October was up, I just don\u2019t have that number in my head. I think, John, can get it for you after the call. But we\u2019ve had very consistent, I think, strong volume growth in the box business for low at the strong execution by that team in the marketplace.", "James Porter", "Yes So the question was what was the mix of our business in the quarter? I\u2019m not quite sure exactly the question. You mentioned export shipments being down. Yes, in that quarter, they were down 29,000 tons. And yet internally with \u2013 due to our stronger corrugated box shipments, we had greater containerboard flowing through our internal channel. And, yes, a somewhat lower shipment to our domestic customer market and a slight increase in inventory. But the balance within our system is one in which we constantly look at our three channels, internal corrugated, external domestic, external international, and that\u2019s how we manage the system. So I\u2019m not sure if that answered specifically your question.", "Steve Voorhees", "Yes, just a question this quarter, I think, Alex looked like he was looking for the reduction of our domestic shipments quarter-over-quarter, that\u2019s approximately 60,000 tons exactly.", "James Porter", "Yes, 29,000 down export, 59,000 domestic, up in our internal channel in the mid-30,000s.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc. Your line is now open.", "Adam Josephson", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone.", "Steve Voorhees", "Good morning, Adam.", "Adam Josephson", "Jim, just a couple for you. Just back to exports for a second, on the last call you talked about seeing strong kraft linerboard markets around the world and you talked about export prices firming, and your exports, I believe are up a 11% year-over-year. Obviously this call you\u2019ve talked about exports being down from a year ago and prices being down both sequentially and from a year ago. So can you just help us understand what changed in the quarter with respect to export volumes and prices?", "James Porter", "Global demand continues to be solid. We really see across all of the global markets demand is there. The impact of currency, however, has been pretty radical. And I certainly would not have forecasted the significant movements in the global currencies and the impact on price, which gives us the challenge of choosing where we \u2013 which markets of the world that we operate in. And fortunately, we have a broad portfolio of customers in North America and across the globe to be able to serve. And you\u2019ve seen us making those decisions in this past quarter accordingly.", "Adam Josephson", "Got it. Jim, thanks for that. And just not to beat a dead horse here, but in terms of what happened in October, have you previously taken either recycled mills or kraft linerboard machines down for just a couple of weeks in this case? It just seemed from the outside to be a very short time to take those mills/machines down. But obviously we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on internally. Was it at all demand related or was it just \u2013 is that typical for you to do to take machines down for just a couple of weeks in this case?", "James Porter", "Absolutely. We\u2019ve been operating for the past several years matching supply with demand. And we\u2019ve got a great containerboard system and a wonderful portfolio of customers, but we have more installed capacities than our customer base. And so we\u2019re always optimizing our production capacity to meet demand. And you\u2019ve seen us indefinitely idle a number of our paper machines both version and recycled. And we are always operating in a mode, in some cases, we\u2019re slowing assets back. So this frankly was a very usual type of behavior, particularly in a quarter where we have very low maintenance and capital-related downtime.", "Adam Josephson", "Jim, and just one last one, can you talk about what the cost of market downtime is for the company and how you calculate that cost, and separately what the cost of the Coshocton closure will be? And thank you very much.", "Steve Voorhees", "Okay, just with respect to the cost of downtime, there is all sorts of different ways to look at it. I think if you are looking at the impact on our financial statements and you want to model something, I think using something in the range of $120 to $150 per ton should do it. I don\u2019t have the cash cost of the Coshocton closure. I just don\u2019t have it in my head.", "James Porter", "I don\u2019t either. The benefit is approximately $33 million in reduced cost, and the capital avoidance impact, which on average is approximately $4 million a year.", "Steve Voorhees", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner from Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Scott Gaffner", "Good morning. Just following up on the export shipments for the corrugated business, if I heard you correctly, it sounded as if you pulled back on exports not because of demand, but more because of price realization in the export markets. And if so which markets did you end up pulling back on specifically?", "James Porter", "The global markets are ones, as in all markets in which there is a range of pricing in each of those markets in the world and we make decisions to serve our customers and maximize our profitability. So there is really no specific market that we avoided. We just optimized our mix. We really don\u2019t share specificity relative to those issues.", "Scott Gaffner", "Okay. But the demand was there, you just chose to serve certain markets versus others. Correct?", "James Porter", "Well, each of the economies of the world certainly have their own demand variation. But in total the global demand for North American virgin containerboard, virgin containerboard period, remains quite solid. And we constantly try to optimize our mix through the three channels that we sell to.", "Scott Gaffner", "Okay. If I look at the $150 million of run rate synergy realization that you had in the quarter, I mean, it\u2019s exactly what you said you were going to do, you went out, you did it. But anything in there within the $150 million that sort of surprised you to the upside, and anything to the downside as you work through the integration synergy realization process?", "Ward Dickson", "Hey, Adam, this is Ward. I think we are pleased with our progress so far. If you look at the profile, as we talked about on the call last quarter, we entered the quarter with a $75 million run rate. We\u2019re clearly getting the benefits related to consolidation of some of the corporate overhead pools. I would say that we\u2019ve achieved about $50 million of the $100 million that we originally anticipated in the merger-related synergies. And then I think we\u2019re off to a very good start, both in the procurement organization and then some of the internalization discussions that we had across both the mills and our packaging organization.", "So we were \u2013 if I gave you a number we were right around $165 million is what we achieved in the quarter. I mean, that was the annualized exit rate that we achieved. And as we talked about, we\u2019re tracking it project by project. And now that we have P&Ls at the plant basis across the whole company. We\u2019re now building the linkages between the synergy projects and the plant P&Ls to make sure that we\u2019re actually realizing the benefits through the \u2013 through our earnings.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Your line is now open.", "Anthony Pettinari", "Good morning. I had a follow up on the corrugated business and specifically Brazil. I was wondering how much Rigesa exported in the quarter and maybe what percentage of production you can export from Brazil? And then does Rigesa compete in the same export markets as your North American system, or do you just talk about how those two systems meet each other in the global market?", "James Porter", "We \u2013 good morning, Anthony. We can assume within the Brazilian corrugated system approximately 80,000 tons a quarter. And we sell domestically and export approximately 40,000 tons a quarter. And the balance of Brazilian domestic sales and export is split pretty evenly. Now at the present time because of the currency related impact of the Brazilian real, we are biasing towards international shipments to gain that favorable advantage. And much of that is in continent, within South America, but there is some that goes into the European markets. And we do look at that in relation to the \u2013 our broader international sales from our North American containerboard business so..", "Anthony Pettinari", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then in past quarters you\u2019ve given us updates on the inflation of EVOL in the U.S. And I was just wondering if you could give us an update there and just generally on the box plan optimization activities that\u2019s going on and kind of the legacy RockTenn containerboard system?", "Steve Voorhees", "Sure. We\u2019re in the process of installing EVOL number 16 and 17 out of 30. So we\u2019re just implementing the program that we talked about. We just chose not to mention it just because we already had a lot of content in the call. The box plant system, the team is working I think exceptionally well and they are delivering great results. Bob, do you have anything to add?", "Bob Beckler", "Yes, not much to add to that, Steve. I just think it\u2019s the combination of both really terrific commercial execution in the box business in North America. As you mentioned in your prepared comments, the retention of customers has improved dramatically over the last year with just a focus on operating fundamentals around quality, service, and reliability while we\u2019re building a more robust pipeline. So it\u2019s very gratifying that the business continues to outpace the industry, as it has over the last year. And just really rigorous a focus on productivity and synergy at the operating level, and the EVOLs are a part of the story, but just a lot of blocking and tackling going on in that business that\u2019s leading to really great and improved results at the converting level.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng from Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Philip Ng", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "Steve Voorhees", "Good morning, Phi", "Philip Ng", "The 114,000 tons of maintenance downtime you\u2019re taking in corrugated in the first quarter, how much of that is a pull forward? And can you give us a sense of what the cadence is going to be for the rest of the year? And also assuming demand and pricing essentially holds, are you pretty much back to the balance level and can you kind of frame what kind of economic downtime you plan to take going forward? Thanks.", "James Porter", "Well, first, we don\u2019t comment on economic downtime going forward. We\u2019ve shared that in the October month, we took approximately 55,000 tons of economic downtime, however, I can\u2019t comment going forward. Relative to the 114,000 and the December quarter, I think you used the word pull-up. I would not characterize there as being any pull up that maintenance capital outage downtime schedule is one which we build frankly years in advance to try to hit the cycles of recovery, boiler rebuilds, and the necessary inspections and maintenance regime we needed to execute our business. And that volume is I think would be usual.", "Relative to the go forward, we would have somewhat less volume than the 114,000 in the next quarter, approximately the same in the third, and very little in our fourth quarter would be the normal cadence for our business. To your question on supply with demand, yes we are matched with supply with demand and it\u2019s something we plan for constantly. And the decisions we make are all focused on supplying our customers in the most efficient manner.", "Philip Ng", "Okay. I guess a question for Ward. The buyback you guys did there in quarter, I think it was a little north of $300 million. Is that kind of a good run rate going forward? I know you\u2019re below your leverage target \u2013 or was it more being more opportunistic with the pull back in the market? Thanks.", "Ward Dickson", "Sure. As you look at the leverage target had the SP Fiber acquisition closed in the last week of the quarter rather than in the first week, we would have been at a pro forma leverage ratio of 2.2 times just on the \u2013 just shy of the low-end of our targeted range. I think Steve mentioned in his comments that we did \u2013 we\u2019ve got to make sure that we retained the continuity of interest to preserve the tax-free spend. So we\u2019ve had to actually track the common shareholders at a fund level. That did constrain us to a bit as we were in the quarter, but we did buy back over 5 million shares in the quarter. I think we\u2019ve been consistent about executing against our leverage ratio. I don\u2019t think we are tied to the absolute target on any \u2013 at any quarter. But I think our actions have been pretty consistent with the capital allocation strategy that we described at the announcement of the merger.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon from Vertical Research. Your line is now open.", "Chip Dillon", "Yes. Thanks and good morning, Steve and Ward. First question \u2013 and Jim. First question \u2013 and Bob, actually is on the depreciation and amortization, does that include the $285 million run rate, does that include chemicals, or is that taken out?", "Steve Voorhees", "That does include chemicals.", "Chip Dillon", "Okay. So that will stay there until the spin actually occurs?", "Steve Voorhees", "That\u2019s correct.", "Chip Dillon", "Okay. And then you\u2019ve mentioned the cost that Coshocton was running, that sort of implies that either you were losing money there or is that a fair statement, or at least you weren\u2019t really getting much contribution, I guess, in recent months from that mill?", "Steve Voorhees", "I don\u2019t think that we can go over that with you, but it was doing fine.", "Chip Dillon", "Okay. Gotcha. Okay. And then looking at Newberg, I know that the one machine there that was converted to packaging papers, I guess, loosely defined was not that long ago, I think in March. I understood the machine had about 200,000 tons of capacity. And could you sort of give us an idea of how much of that machine was running medium versus bag paper and other things?", "James Porter", "The mix of business on that machine was pretty evenly split between bag and containerboard and it \u2013 but it certainly was not full, geat paper machine. Both of those machines really have excellent potential and capability and make a wonderful product. But it \u2013 we just don\u2019t need those machines at the present time within our supply/demand balance scenario.", "Chip Dillon", "Gotcha. That\u2019s clear. And I guess lastly, when you look at the \u2013 let\u2019s say the capacity \u2013 actually I think that covers it for me. Thank you.", "Steve Voorhees", "Okay. Thanks, Chip.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover from DA Davidson. Your line is now open.", "Steve Chercover", "Thank you. So it\u2019s good to see that your North American containerboard margins are now north of 20%. However, they are still below that of some of your major competitors. And I\u2019m wondering can that gap be closed with investment, or is it something structural or pertaining to the furnish that you use?", "James Porter", "We work hard on it every single day. And it\u2019s a combination of the types of things that we\u2019ve been discussing relative to getting our portfolio of assets structured in the lowest cost manner. It\u2019s channel optimization of our customer portfolio across the world and it\u2019s business improvement and operating efficiency enhancement. Literally thousands of things that our team is constantly working on. And we\u2019ve got a nice portfolio on the table currently that we\u2019re looking forward to delivering on. And over time I would see that gap closing.", "Steve Chercover", "But it\u2019s fair to say that improvement in North American containerboard is not really something that we would put into the synergy bucket, correct?", "Steve Voorhees", "Generally not. I think there would be some areas to where you would have synergies. We have better scale for providing corporate services. We have better scale for procurement. But just on the direct, we\u2019re not adding North American containerboard assets as a result of the merger. So we don\u2019t expect to improve.", "I would just add on to Jim\u2019s comments of \u2013 it\u2019s a competitive business. We can only improve our system. I think we have very good opportunities to improve our system, and that was incorporated when we came up with our productivity target. And I feel very good about the team we have working on that and our ability to improve the results in the North American corrugated business. How that translates into our GAAP, I can\u2019t really respond to that.", "Steve Chercover", "Okay. And sorry if I\u2019m somehow missing this, but can you clarify how open market purchases of your equity have any implications for the ratio of RockTenn and MeadWestvaco ownership?", "Steve Voorhees", "Yes, one of the things that we are trying to put and make sure that we preserve is the tax-free nature of the spin. And there is the continuity of ownership that we maintain the 50.1% through the period of the spin. So we actually had to go down to a fund level and identify those owners that were common share owners on July 1. And that\u2019s the opportunity set for the amount of shares that we\u2019ve been able to repurchase.", "Steve Chercover", "Yes. And I understand the importance of maintaining the tax structure. So you actually have to go to the fund level to say \u2013 to see whose shares you\u2019re buying?", "Steve Voorhees", "No, no, whose shares owned both MWV on July 1. And one of the elements that we are doing \u2013 we did file a PLR, a private letter ruling request with the IRS about the spin of specialty chemicals. And this is one of the items that we are trying to get a ruling from the IRS that will give us more freedom as we move forward.", "Steve Chercover", "But presumably after March 1, you can just go guns a blazing, right?", "Steve Voorhees", "Yes. And we believe that we have a \u2013 right now we have a capacity of about 10 million shares that we can feel even before we get a ruling from the IRS that we have the ability to buy back.", "Steve Chercover", "Very good. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Steve Voorhees", "Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.", "Chris Manuel", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "Steve Voorhees", "Good morning, Chris.", "Chris Manuel", "Maybe wanted to \u2013 maybe come back to the SP Fiber stuff for a second. So I have a question around it and I do have a follow-up. But with the SP stuff, could you maybe give us a sense -- I think you paid a little under $300 million for it, but what exactly you bought? You have \u2013 there were two locations. What did you have in mills, what was capacity and such there? And then along those lines as well, what may have changed with dynamics between the time you announced things in August until we got to October that perhaps it sounds like, I think, my understanding is the majority of it or the bulk of the mills are closed.", "James Porter", "Chris, we\u2019re really delighted with the purchase of SP Fiber. And what we bought were four big, wide, fast, low-cost paper machines. And it gives us lots of optionality in the production of containerboard grades as well as lightweight kraft bag, et cetera. And so we\u2019re really quite pleased with having those assets, particularly Dublin. The Dublin mill, extremely well laid out, very efficient, lot of upside potential for further improvement in their cost structure by operating it as a part of our larger containerboard system. So we just see exceptional opportunity.", "The Newberg mill all along with the newsprint production at that mill was one in which we were \u2013 we knew would be challenging. In the newsprint market, I think, you all understand as well as we do it is on a continuing decline. So what we have in newsprint in Newberg is the optionality on these two excellent big, wide, fast paper machines that give us the opportunity to consider what future needs may be for those assets. But currently we are indefinitely idling them and that improves the cash flow of the acquisition and the earnings from that case.", "Chris Manuel", "Maybe some clarification there. What was the capacity on each of those, the newsprint machines and then the stuff in Dublin?", "James Porter", "It depends on what grades you run them on. But round numbers, you could make up to 300,000 tons a piece on each of those machines depending upon what products they are producing.", "Chris Manuel", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then my second question was during the quarter, we had a transaction in the chemical space with Arizona that probably gives us a reasonable look at as packaging analysts and not primarily chemicals analysts, or a reasonable read as to what a multiple might look like for Ingevity. Why or why not might that be a reasonable thing to think about or not?", "Steve Voorhees", "Yes, Bob, do you want?", "Bob Beckler", "Yes. So, Chris, this is Bob Beckler. Yes, I think you are right in that, it\u2019s a data point. But you really have to look at Ingevity in the broader specialty chemical space. And there has just been widespread of valuations in that space that are generally still very, very attractive. While we do compete in the space that Arizona Chemical participates in on pine chemicals, I would say, we fly at a higher level in terms of targeting premium applications for pine chemicals and derivatives.", "For example, the pavement technologies or asphalt emulsifiers that we have in that business, which Arizona largely does not have, are very attractive and performed extremely well, record sales in the last quarter. So it is a data point, but I would say there is also a lot of apples and oranges. So I wouldn\u2019t take it too literally.", "Chris Manuel", "That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, guys. Good luck.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Steve Voorhees", "Debbie?", "Debbie Jones", "Hi, there. Good morning. I wanted to talk about the home health and beauty business. It doesn\u2019t get a lot of attention on these calls, but you talked I think last quarter about some investment to meet customer needs. Can you just kind of elaborate on whether that is to kind of grow volumes, what you are kind of expecting in that business? And then also how core is this business to you?", "Steve Voorhees", "Bob?", "Bob Beckler", "Hi, Debbie, it\u2019s Bob Beckler again. And thanks for giving a little attention to what is really a great business in the packaging portfolio. Steve mentioned in his prepared comments, it had a terrific quarter, and they continue to build on this track record of improvement that you have seen in the business over the last two years now, which has come from a combination of things. It\u2019s been a better commercial strategy targeting more attractive niches in the global market, better plant loadings and better productivity. And we have made incremental investments in that business that are required to support our customers, our partners with their particular rollouts.", "So it\u2019s all working together and continues to show a very positive trend. In terms of the fit, question we like it for three reasons. One is the overlap that the home health and beauty dispensing system business has with our other paper and packaging businesses. Roughly $1 million \u2013 $1 billion of WestRock sales are to customers that buy dispenser products and other paperboard and packaging products from WestRock. We also have really strong relationships with these customers through the dispensing system business, because it\u2019s a highly technical and innovative business.", "And so these are more like partnerships, which then we can leverage with our other packaging businesses. And then finally it\u2019s a global business, which gives us the opportunity to reach beyond the North American orders. So we still feel very good about the fit and the performance of that business.", "Debbie Jones", "Thanks, that\u2019s helpful. If I could one final question, you mentioned earlier you don\u2019t make the public announcements on your idle mills. And I appreciate these are difficult decisions, but can you help us understand going forward, does it make sense for you when you\u2019re managing supply with demand to idle mills for a short duration, or is this primarily just kind of related to the inclusion of Dublin in your system?", "James Porter", "The \u2013 I think as we\u2019ve shared, Debbie, that the levers that we have to balance supply with demand and demand varies, right? It depends upon our North American corrugated packaging business, global demand, et cetera. So we have to be flexible in the large system we operate between maintenance and capital downtime, idling, and slowback. So you\u2019ll see us operating that flexibility in a way that we think is the optimal way to supply our customers at the lowest cost.", "Debbie Jones", "Okay.", "James Porter", "So short answer you will see us continuing to use those levers going forward.", "Debbie Jones", "Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll turn it over.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Mark Wilde from Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open.", "Mark Wilde", "Good morning.", "Steve Voorhees", "Hello, Mark.", "Mark Wilde", "Steve, I wondered if we could just kind of take a step back for a minute. For those of us who have been covering the company for a long time, we recall that Smurfit-Stone was a pretty choppy ride for the first 12 months of that deal. Anything you\u2019re trying to do differently this time?", "Steve Voorhees", "That\u2019s a great question. I think, yes. But they are very different situations. Smurfit was literally an acquisition. This is a merger and it\u2019s a great that it\u2019s a merger, because one of the big issues we had in Smurfit I\u2019m going to put into the category of culture that we were integrating into our organization. At the time I was CFO. My job tripled overnight and then the Smurfit organization had not just been successful over a long period of time. And that continues to be a lesson for me of how that can really impact a culture.", "This merger is very much different, because I think most of the people on the call would have known both companies and WestRock\u2019s bringing the best of both companies to the table. We\u2019re highly complementary. I think you could pro forma either company, and I guess we are trying to pro forma both companies going forward. And we\u2019ve got a tremendous future together, which is better than either company would have on its own. So depending on which side you\u2019re on we can go through and then write the opportunities. But we effectively, from a culture standpoint, we\u2019ve put a much greater emphasis on that.", "And so we\u2019re moving beyond. This is a merger of two companies that it\u2019s a creation of a new company which is WestRock and we\u2019re working together. I\u2019m very optimistic about the future of the company and I think on \u2013 in the call, I think, we focused a lot on a very discrete set of actions we took, which I think were misinterpreted by the business. But underlying that, I think, we are performing at an exceptional level, that we\u2019re delivering the merger and performance improvements.", "Somebody asked about is there \u2013 was there a surprise, and I would like to think that there is an expectation we\u2019re going to go out and get that. But we are meeting that expectation I\u2019d say with enthusiasm across the organization. And that\u2019s going to end up what we need to do that to be successful. While all that is going on, we have, I think, each one of our businesses on a day-to-day basis is operating exceptionally well.", "I\u2019m very excited about the reaction we\u2019re getting from the customers. They are coming to us and asking us what can \u2013 what\u2019s this about and we\u2019re having conversation, it\u2019s a little bit early to tell what the ultimate tale to tape is. But I think it\u2019s going to position us to be a remarkably successful company going forward. So thank you for the opportunity, Mark.", "Mark Wilde", "All right, that\u2019s helpful. Listen, I have just as a follow on, a couple of questions around pricing and volume. You had flagged $17 million of pricing weakness in consumer packaging. And then over in pine chemicals you had talked about both pricing and volume pressure from petrochemical-based alternatives. And I wondered if you could just provide a little color on both of those?", "Bob Beckler", "Hi, Mark, it\u2019s Bob. Let me start with specialty chemicals and then we can come back to consumer packaging. I think, as you know having called the business the specialty chemical business that will become Ingevity is a highly flexible business around its refinery system. And oilfield technologies has definitely seen the impact of what\u2019s happening in the broader sector. But let me give you a couple of statistics to put it in perspective.", "So well count \u2013 oil well counts are down about 65% across the industry year-on-year, yet our revenue in that specific sector is only down about 40%. So we\u2019re actually taking share in a down market in oilfield, which is a market that we really like for its profitability and that\u2019s because we just have really great highly differentiated products. And at the same time we were able to shift business over into industrial specialties. Yes, there has been some pricing movement with the dislocations that are occurring and a very modest offset in volume. But as I said earlier and one of my answer is, we\u2019re able to move into some other areas that help offset that volume decline. And asphalt pavement technologies has been an example of that, up 19% versus prior year.", "So a lot a big movements in the business. But really great effort by the team in managing through what has been a fairly volatile period of time. And I think it will position them well for the future. Mark, can you repeat your question on consumer?", "Mark Wilde", "Yes. You had flagged $17 million of pricing weakness in consumer packaging. So just trying to understand where that is. We\u2019ve all heard some reports about sort of weakness in international SBS markets. I\u2019m just trying to understand whether that\u2019s the whole story there or whether you are seeing it in some other markets?", "Bob Beckler", "Yes, Mark. Well, I think it\u2019s both the paperboard and converting answer to your question. We have definitely seen the FX impact to the downside on both revenue and translation back at the profitability. With paperboard exports less so on the converting siding with the exception of our beverage business, which our beverage multi-pack business is about 50% outside of North America. And so there has been some FX exposure there as well.", "On the converting side, overall if you step back, we are really pleased with how we are performing in our markets. Our volumes are up. We\u2019re managing well in terms of mix and pipeline development with customers. And so overall, I think, the converting side of consumer solutions is performing well. Anything, Jim, you would add on the paperboard side?", "James Porter", "No, I don\u2019t think so. I think we like the positions we\u2019re in with respect to our specialty products that supply the high-end initiatives of the paperboard markets in North America and globally. We do feel some pressure from FX, which we\u2019re all aware of, but fundamentally the business is operating extremely well and we have a product portfolio that\u2019s in demand and we like our position.", "Mark Wilde", "All right. You\u2019ve got an excellent system. So I just that, if I can kind of read through this, it sounds like that $17 million is mostly on the mill side and it probably skews to the kind of the international trade component of the business. Is that correct?", "James Porter", "It\u2019s a good assumption. I think it\u2019s somewhat balanced between our \u2013 it\u2019s largely international sales across the portfolio of converted products.", "Steve Voorhees", "So, Mark, we\u2019ll just \u2013 I\u2019m not \u2013 we need to provide a better answer. We will do that in the Q that we file.", "Mark Wilde", "Okay. All right. That\u2019s helpful, Steve.", "Steve Voorhees", "I think rather than try to \u2013 I think that business has so many elements to it to try to isolate that specific price risk is a little bit difficult for us right now. So we\u2019ll include it in our Q, an explanation, so everybody will see that. Okay?", "Mark Wilde", "Fair enough. Thank you.", "A - Steve Voorhees", "Okay. Thanks, Mark. Operator I think we are complete with the call. Again, I want to express my appreciation for everybody taking their time to listen to the call. And we will speak to you next quarter. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you, speakers. And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating.

[Operator Instructions]. This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I will turn the meeting over to your host, Mr. Matthew Tractenberg. Sir, you may begin.", "Matt Tractenberg", "Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our FY16 third quarter earnings call. My name is Matt Tractenberg. I am WestRock's new Vice President of Investor Relations and I am excited to be here. I am joined this morning by Steve Vorhees, WestRock's Chief Executive Officer; Ward Dickson, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Porter, President of our Paper Solutions business. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discussed during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the SEC, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015.", "Additionally, we will be referencing adjusted or non-GAAP, financial measures during the call. We have provided reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of this slide presentation. The slide presentation is available on our website. With that said, I will turn the call over to you, Steve.", "Steve Voorhees", "Thanks, Matt. Good morning. Thanks for joining our call. For those of you who have not yet met Matt, Matt joined WestRock in May. He has 10 years of investor relations experience. I'm very happy Matt has decided to join our team here at WestRock. I want to start by taking a moment to look back on the first year of WestRock. It's been an exciting year, one that has had many accomplishments. The merger has gone extremely well and now, a year in, I'm pleased to report we've brought together a great team, created a great Company with the size and scale to succeed in the marketplace and deliver attractive and increasing cash flows to investors.", "WestRock holds the number one or two market share positions in attractive packaging markets. We're providing differentiated packaging solutions that help our customers win in the marketplace and our broad portfolio of products and services is resonating well with customers. We're delivering on the expectations that we outlined at the outset of the merger.", "These expectations fall into three overall categories, cash flow, productivity and the use of our balanced capital allocation strategy to create long term value. Beginning with cash flow, we managed our business to maximize our long term cash flow returns and we executed well on this objective during the quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $532 million, with $106 million coming from the reduction of inventory in our corrugated and Consumer Packaging businesses.", "We expect that our full-year FY16 adjusted free cash flow will exceed $1 billion. This was the upper end of our previously stated guidance. This highlights the strength of our business model, the capabilities of our team, our leadership position in the marketplace. It is worth pointing out that WestRock stock continues to provide an attractive, free cash flow yield of nearly 10% at the current share price.", "Next, productivity, improving productivity requires us to mobilize our Organization, getting literally hundreds of projects defined and completed. WestRock's teams are getting a lot done to improve productivity. This is demonstrated by the $105 million of productivity benefits realized in our quarterly earnings and our current annual run rate of synergies and performance improvements of $425 million. Our balanced capital allocation strategy includes paying an attractive dividend, reinvesting in our businesses, pursuing acquisitions that improve our business and repurchasing WestRock shares, all while keeping leverage within our targeted range of 2.25 to 2.5 times EBITDA. Over the past year, in addition to the $1 billion that we returned to stockholders, we invested $1.4 billion back into our business through more than $800 million in capital expenditures and approximately $600 million in acquisitions, including our joint venture with Grupo Gondi.", "This quarter we successfully completed the separation of Ingevity. I'm pleased to see the stock perform well. WestRock shareholders who have held on to their Ingevity stock have over $6 per WestRock equivalent share of additional value. All told, we're executing well on our strategy and this is reflected in our results for the quarter. During the quarter, we performed well across our businesses. Sales for the June quarter were $3.6 billion and adjusted earnings per share was $0.71. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $611 million or 17.3% of sales, driven by strong capture of our synergy and performance improvement opportunities.", "Adjusted EBITDA margins improved by 190 basis points in the Consumer Packaging segment versus the prior year. We generated adjusted free cash flow of $373 million in the quarter. This brings our fiscal year-to-date free cash flow to slightly more than $800 million. Then how about this? Over the last 12 months, we achieved more than $350 million in productivity benefits that positively impacted our income statement and cash flow. Our leverage ratio at quarter-end was 2.33 times. This is within our targeted range. We repurchased 1.2 million shares in the quarter, bringing the total to 12.5 million shares or almost 5% of the outstanding shares over the past 12 months.", "Our Corrugated Packaging team executed very well in the quarter, with North American adjusted EBITDA margins of 18.3%. This is an increase of 80 basis points sequentially. Our North American box shipments declined by 2% on a per day basis from the very strong prior-year quarter. Our fiscal year-to-date box shipments have increased over the last year and in July, our box volumes have increased 1.7% on a per day basis over last year. Our backlogs are higher than last year. I am very encouraged by our new business pipeline that's up significantly over last year and is a leading indicator of volume growth.", "Our box prices declined $16 per ton from the prior-year period as a result of the previously published pulp and paperweight container board price declines. Sequentially, third quarter box pricing declined by only $6 per ton. Shipments of domestic container board were about the same as last year. They were up slightly sequentially. Prices of domestic container board were flat sequentially. Current North American container board markets are healthy, with industry operating rates at 95.6%. Industry daily box shipments increased by 1.5% in June over the prior year. Container board consumption increased 2.4% in June and industry inventory levels declined and are now down to four weeks of supply.", "Shipments of export container board decreased slightly from the prior year and increased slightly sequentially. Our mix of export business was unchanged, with approximately 60% to Latin America and the rest split between Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Export pricing declined only $2 per ton sequentially. The negative price mix across our box, domestic independent and export customers had a pre-tax impact of $41 million in the quarter as compared to last year. This unfavorable impact was directly offset by ongoing productivity improvement efforts.", "Sequential changes in pricing and mix reduced income by less than $15 million which reflects very favorably on our disciplined approach to the market. We balanced our supply with our market demand by taking 72,000 tons of economic downtime in the quarter. In addition, we took 60,000 tons of maintenance downtime. The joint venture with Grupo Gondi, the premier operator in Mexico, is now complete. As a reminder, we hold 25% ownership interest in the partnership. Their exceptional team and exceptional assets provide us with a growth platform in a very attractive market. In the quarter, we shipped 67,000 tons of container board to the joint venture.", "We anticipate our shipments into Mexico will increase going forward, both from additional integration opportunities, as well as from strong growth opportunities. We're reporting Gondi's results in the equity investment line on the income statement. For the three months in the June quarter, Gondi's sales were $188 million and EBITDA margins exceeded 20%. I would encourage you, for the purpose of valuation to include our share of their EBITDA at an appropriate multiple Based on our independent purchase price valuation as of the time of formation of the joint venture, this was in excess of $1 per share for WestRock's interest. Gondi's management is led by Eduardo Posada and they've moved quickly to deploy additional capital available to them as a result of the joint venture. This includes the announcement of the acquisition of the Aluprint folding carton business and the order of 11 new production lines from Bobst and BHS that will be used to upgrade existing Gondi plants and capitalize new plants.", "In Brazil, our performance remains strong, despite the continued challenges the country faces, With EBITDA margins of almost 23%, our combined corrugated box and container board shipments increased by 5% compared to the prior year. Our year-to-date box volumes are tracking the industry, down 2.3% and we're implementing price increases to mitigate input cost inflation. The Tres Barras Mill is running well and we're capitalizing on strong mill performance and weak local currency to profitably export liner board to offset the impact of a soft domestic box market. As we indicated on our last call, we expected inflation in natural gas, recycled fiber prices during the third quarter to begin to have an impact. This played out as we anticipated, as seen in the recycled fiber prices which were higher by $7 per ton. An increase in natural gas prices has started to impact us this fourth quarter, but prices are still down as compared to last year.", "The average NYMEX natural gas price for the third quarter was $1.95, lower than the current strip of $2.82 for the second half of the calendar year. Overall, the Corrugated Packaging team navigated the market extremely well, offsetting price with productivity improvements and aggressively executing our commercial strategy. I will now turn to our Consumer Packaging business. We drove meaningful adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 190 basis points from the prior-year period. This was on solid productivity and integration synergies. Consumer Packaging net sales for the quarter were $1.64 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $275 million.", "We're in the process of integrating 250,000 tons per year in SBS volumes from both internalized consumption and the Carolina business. Pricing was stable in our core markets in the quarter, as the published price reductions covering SBS, CRB and URB in Pulp and Paper Week had limited impact on our results at this point, given our differentiated strategy, portfolio and mix. We delivered $59 million in productivity improvements year-over-year, reflecting the great progress we're making in integrating our Consumer Packaging businesses and realizing the synergies and performance improvements across our expanded platform. Demand has been stable in our folding carton and beverage packaging grades, as well as an our merchandising displays, home, health and beauty groups.", "In our consumer mills, industry backlogs improved during the second half of the quarter, particularly in SBS; we're now above prior-year levels. We're entering the quarter with backlogs of five weeks. Of note, we're continuing to see solid demand growth from hot and cold drink cups. In SBS, we're seeing limited penetration at this point from European and Asian competitors. CRB is the softest grade due to continuing pressures on packaged food categories such as cereals, crackers and snacks. Our backlogs for CRB and CNK range from two to three weeks. Beverage had a strong quarter, posting improvements in profitability versus prior-year due to productivity.", "We continue to achieve gains in global beer and sparkling water markets which offset the continued weakness in traditional carbonated soft drink demand, primarily North American. We continue to grow with customers that have packaging needs that correspond well with our strategy and capabilities, including craft brewers, new product introductions and paperboard multi-packs in Latin America and China.", "Our folding carton team performed very well in the quarter and is executing on our differentiated strategy. Organic sales growth was up slightly as compared to a slight decline for the overall folding carton industry. Integration of the Cenveo facilities into our folding carton business has been successful. As part of the integration, we announced the closure of a former Cenveo facility in Jacksonville, Florida. This closure, as well as internalization of mill tons, is driving $12 million of current run rate synergies. We're projecting $17 million of total synergies associated with the Cenveo transaction; this is $10 million more than originally projected. Using the acquisition purchase price of $98 million, we paid 3 times EBITDA after synergies. This is a terrific transaction for WestRock.", "Home, health and beauty results significantly exceeded the prior-year, driven by strong sales executions on growth and mix improvement initiatives, cost containment and operating productivity. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter were at a record for the business and were several hundred basis points higher than prior-year. Revenue was 4% higher than prior-year, due to growth in North America, Europe and Brazil. In merchandising displays, customer promotional activity has stabilized and we're seeing year-over-year growth with many of our customers. Our cost actions had a positive impact on results and we're seeing sequential adjusted EBITDA improvement the last two quarters.", "As part of our long term strategy to balance capacity and investment with market demand, we announced the closure of our Chicago manufacturing facility in April. We anticipate the cost savings of that closure to have a positive impact in FY17. Now I'll turn the call over to Ward, who will talk about the progress we're making with our land and development business, our synergy capture and other financial topics. Ward?", "Ward Dickson", "Thank you, Steve. We made significant progress this quarter and completed a detailed review of projects and strategy within our land and development portfolio. Segment sales for the period were $42 million and segment income was $10 million. We accelerated the sale of the Walworth property and the $27 million in proceeds was more than expected. We have been engaged since January with our Charleston-based team and an outside real estate advisor on a project-by-project review to determine the best path forward to maximize value, accelerate cash flows, reduced development costs and risks. We now expect to complete the accelerated monetization of the portfolio within the next 24 to 30 months and realize gross sales proceeds of approximately $600 million.", "After distributing our partners' ownership interest and paying off project-specific debt, we expect to realize after-tax cash flows of approximately $275 million to $300 million, in line with original purchase price estimates. More than one-half of this cash flow should be realized by the end of FY17. The original book value in the merger accounting was approximately $400 million on a pre-tax basis. As Steve indicated, we continue to execute very well on our synergy and performance improvement objectives. We exited the June quarter at an annual run rate of $425 million. We have generated benefits from the optimization of our consumer mill system, including the internalization of the Carolina tons and the outside bleach board purchases for our folding carton operations.", "In addition, we're realizing savings from our footprint actions in both business segments. We continue to make capital investments that reduce costs, such as our EVOL deployment and press upgrades in our converting operations. WestRock's size and scale has led to sourcing benefits across our raw material purchases. We expect to achieve a $500 million run rate by the end of the fiscal year which is the upper end of our previous range and we remain on track to achieve our $1 billion goal by the end of FY18. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined by $23 million. We had a $20 million unfavorable volume decline, primarily within Consumer Packaging.", "The $39 million unfavorable impact of price and mix was due primarily to our Corrugated business. However, we have benefited from commodity deflation, as lower natural gas and wood prices more than offset increased recycled fiber cost. Labor cost inflation more than offset these lower energy and material costs. We remain committed to our ongoing productivity initiatives and expect them to continue to contribute meaningfully going forward. The small FX impact of only $4 million reflects our primarily U.S. dollar revenue base. And finally, pension income was lower by $18 million, a non-cash impact reflecting our successful pension derisking plan.", "I am pleased with the strong cash flow we have generated through the third quarter which gives us confidence to say we will exceed our $1 billion adjusted free cash flow target for the FY16. We're a Company that generate strong cash flow and believe that this metric is important when valuing WestRock. Some of the key business drivers for the fourth quarter are as follows. First, we anticipate inflation of input cost, including natural gas and recycled fiber. And we're planning major maintenance outages with our Consumer Packaging mill system that will have an approximately $11 million pre-tax impact.", "Additionally, we recognized a $10 million pre-tax benefit during Q3 from our Walworth land sale which sold for more than its stepped-up value. We do not expect to repeat these gains in the fourth quarter and expect a sequential $10 million decline in land and development earnings. However, while these items will result in a sequential decline in adjusted earnings per share, we continue to work aggressively to capture commercial opportunities while controlling cost. We have protected our significant overfunded status in our U.S. pension plans and that has paid off.", "We matched our investment strategy with our pension liability so the decline in interest rates has no impact on our overfunded status, as our assets and liabilities move in tandem. We were overfunded by 107% against our GAAP liability which translated to a $450 million overfunding as of July 15. We do not expect to make any contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan. Steve, I will hand it back over to you for closing comments.", "Steve Voorhees", "Thanks, Ward. Let's look back at the first year of WestRock. We have allocated $2.4 billion of capital. We have invested $841 million in capital expenditures. We expect to invest $800 million to $825 million during this fiscal year. This includes the Ingevity funding prior to the separation. While we've completed our capital expenditure plans for FY17, we expect capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $725 million to $750 million. We estimate our annual maintenance capital needs to be approximately $400 million to $450 million. We see numerous attractive return-generating opportunities providing between 15% and 25% unlevered after-tax returns on these investments.", "Over the past year, we have returned $1 billion or more than 40%, to $2.4 billion to stockholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. This return of capital to stockholders will continue to be an important part of our capital allocation strategy. We continue to see acquisitions as an important growth driver for WestRock. We have a proven core competency in making good acquisitions and driving fantastic results from them. This is an exciting time for WestRock. I want to thank all of our WestRock co-workers who have worked to achieve all that we've accomplished in the first year.", "If you look back, our accomplishments in the first year are significant. We successfully integrated the Companies, both culturally and operationally. We delivered more than $350 million of productivity benefits. We separated Ingevity, completed two acquisitions and formed our partnership with Gondi. That's just a partial list because most importantly, we're building WestRock for the future.", "We're investing in developing key commercial and operational capabilities that will support our teams as we build upon our accomplishments. WestRock provides value-added innovative paper and packaging solutions that help our customers win in the marketplace and we deliver attractive and increasing cash flows for our shareholders over the long term.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "George Staphos", "My first question, can you talk a bit about your ability to replicate the productivity performance in consumer in upcoming quarters? Your performance was better than our expectations in the model. What comparative factors may weigh against it or accelerate it? Obviously, you have the maintenance program -- or the maintenance outage of $11 million this coming quarter?", "Ward Dickson", "As I think of the synergies and performance improvements that we've had in consumer, we have had a lot of the benefits related to the merger occur in the segment and we've done that very quickly. We have had the internalization of the Carolina tons, the internalization of our external folding carton tons and we've done that on the front end of the merger. We will continue to have those benefits. We will continue to have the sourcing benefits that we're seeing across both segments flow through. We will start to achieve some of the synergies that we -- and realize them related to the Cenveo acquisition and the internalization.", "We do have the headwinds in the fourth quarter related to the downtime that we will be taking across the consumer mill system. So we're making -- some of the synergies reported to date were front-end loaded related to the internalization, but we're continuing to generate gains across both our converting operations and the mill system.", "George Staphos", "Okay, so to conclude on that, until you lap this last 12 months, we can continue more or less at this pace, obviously adjusted for whatever volume is going to bring you and also the quarter-to quarter maintenance effects. Would that be fair?", "Ward Dickson", "That is fair.", "George Staphos", "Okay. The other thing I had and then I will turn it over, on the Corrugated side, again, you're a bit better than our forecast. Congratulations on that. Can you talk to the degree you think you have still natural ability to move lower on the cost curve across your fleet of mills? Thank you, guys.", "Steve Voorhees", "Jim?", "Jim Porter", "I'm great, thank you. George, we have an incredible runway of opportunities in our corrugated mill system to drive value. We've got a big system and you've seen us make changes to our portfolio with the closure of three of our assets and the acquisition of Dublin which has been a reset in our capability to move products around through our system and has improved our free cash flow within the portfolio.", "We also have substantial capital investments that are producing fruits. We have a supply chain system that is going through substantial improvement and modification. You've seen that evidenced by the dramatic drop in inventories that we posted this last quarter. So there's a nice runway of projects and our team is highly aligned and driven to create productivity.", "George Staphos", "Jim, do you think you can move down one quartile?", "Jim Porter", "That's being a little specific, George. We have -- each mill has its own runway of opportunities and we still have some movement between our assets, but certainly that concept is what drives us.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mark Weintraub of Buckingham. Your line is now open.", "Mark Weintraub", "Thank you. I was hoping if possible to get a bit more color on the comment that you're very encouraged by the business pipeline and noting that, that's a good indicator. One thing that -- a very good quarter, obviously -- one thing, year-over-year volume was still a negative for you in what's been a not a great but an okay environment. How close are we, do you think, to where that volume variable can start being a positive for you?", "Steve Voorhees", "Mark, on the pipeline, we have a very structured approach build, go-to-market in container. We measure backlogs, we measure pipelines and they have proven to be very reliable indicators of changes in volume over time. I reported I was very encouraged by the business pipeline. That's because we aggregate the potential we have across our system and prioritize it, I feel very good about our ability to grow volume from this point and have showed in the July results.", "Mark Weintraub", "So you're hoping that, basically, volume can start being a positive, assuming no negative macro developments?", "Steve Voorhees", "Exactly. It was a positive in July.", "Mark Weintraub", "Okay. And maybe somewhat relatedly, you said you'd shipped 60,000 tons of container board to Gondi in the just ended quarter and they ship 211,000 tons of converted product. How much more are they buying from the outside or is most of the balance there board that is actually made at Gondi?", "Jim Porter", "Their assets and that marketplace is one that has substantial growth opportunity and partnering with them gives us an incredible pipeline to further integrate with them. They have approximately 500,000 tons worth of manufacturing capability in the fiber-based packaging grades in Mexico and the balance is procured from others. There is local board that is procured, but a big benefit to Gondi is being able to tap into our very high-quality virgin substrates that gives them further capabilities to penetrate in the markets we serve. So net/net/net, we see a big opportunity to both improve their capabilities, as well as our vertical integration.", "Mark Weintraub", "So would it be fair to say a little bit more on the integration from where it is, but then you grow with them. Is that the way to think about it?", "Jim Porter", "Mark, that is exactly the way to think about it. We can get you the exact number offline.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Phil Ng of Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Phil Ng", "Strong quarter. Backlogs in the CNK and CRB was a little bit weaker than I would've expected. You are taking a little maintenance in fourth quarter, but are you planning to take a little economic downtime, as well? I just want to get some clarity on how order patterns are shaking out in that segment in July and August because I've heard that some of the CPG guys have ratcheted back inventory late in the year?", "Steve Voorhees", "So your question centers on CNK and CRB.", "Phil Ng", "Yes.", "Steve Voorhees", "Both of those segments, we'll say, the demand is solid; however, backlogs have retreated somewhat. The beverage business, as we all know, is seasonally strengthening somewhat below prior years, but it's still a solid market for us. Clearly, the craft brewers is a growth segment and so we will, yes, match our supply with demand and that's the landscape in the CNK area. CRB backlogs in the two- to three-week range and certainly it's competitive in the food board segments of the market, but we like our portfolio. We have a very strong customer base and we will succeed in those markets.", "Phil Ng", "Okay. And a question for Ward, I'm not sure if you prepared to give too much color on 2017, but with input costs rising a bit, some slippage on pricing, offset by synergies and CapEx is looking a little lighter than we baked in. Is that $950 million to $1 billion type free cash flow threshold sustainable when we think about 2017?", "Ward Dickson", "We're in the early stages of doing our FY17 plan. We're not prepared to give any guidance for 2017. We did give what our ongoing CapEx would be, as we move forward into 2017. We feel really good about the runway that we have related to the performance improvements and synergy targets. We will have inflationary pressures just like the rest of our peers in the segment. We will -- as we put the plan together, though, we also have to assess what we think the opportunities are going to be from a volume and price point of view. So we're not prepared to give 2017 cash flow guidance, but we're piercing through the high end of our range for 2016.", "Phil Ng", "One last one for me, now that you guys have spun off Ingevity, should we expect buybacks to pick-up? Just want to get your thoughts on what you're seeing on the M&A pipeline side. There obviously been a few box transactions in the marketplace, further integration probably wouldn't be a bad thing for you guys. Just wanted some thoughts in terms of capital deployment the next year or two? Thanks.", "Steve Voorhees", "Philip, we're going to continue to implement our balanced capital allocation strategy. As far as stock buybacks, we've bought back about $50 million this quarter. That's a $200 million run rate which is in line with where our cash flow generation is. As far as the acquisitions, we continue to look at acquisitions and you should expect us to continue looking at acquisitions and take advantage of the opportunities that we see to improve our business. It's part of our strategy.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Chip Dillon of Vertical Research. Your line is open.", "Chip Dillon", "Yes, good morning, Steve and Ward. First question is on the land sale situation. I know that when Plum Creek did the deal with MeadWestvaco about three years ago, the all-in value of their lands, they implied, were around $530 million. It looks like, if I add this up right, you are expecting $600 million more on top of the $75 million you just got, if I got that right. Is that a fair representation of how much that land value has gone up over those three years? The all-in value might be closer to $700 million or am I -- are there still more lands in addition to the 68,000 acres?", "Ward Dickson", "That is a tough question for me to look back that far. What I can tell you is, we look back and presented to the Board last week a look-back of the total proceeds of the land and development operation. I found an investor presentation that was done by a MeadWestvaco team in 2011 and they projected what the gross proceeds were going to be across all of their holdings.", "We've looked at the sales to-date from 2011 to now and what we think we're going to realize, we're actually on the higher end of the range that they projected back in 2011. So we feel good about the progress. We feel very good about the accelerated monetization strategy that we have and we have confidence that we're going to be able to generate the $600 million in gross proceeds and the $275 million to $300 million of after-tax cash flows to WestRock.", "Chip Dillon", "Okay. As you -- let's say that you continue to get a little bit better than the stepped-up basis, I would assume that, as each quarter as you sell land and you get some above your basis, you would continue to report that as ongoing earnings, so there could be a little bit of lumpiness like we saw this quarter. Is that something we should expect? Nothing major, but I would imagine it could be to be -- could it be a $10 million or $50 million one quarter, $0 the next?", "Ward Dickson", "Exactly. Because remember, we valued each project within the portfolio and we feel very confident about the aggregate, that we will exceed the purchase price original purchase price that was done in the merger accounting, but we could have some ups and downs on the individual projects. That will cause some earnings contribution and volatility from quarter-to quarter.", "Chip Dillon", "Okay. And then just the last question, just on the container board business. Are you happy now, in the sense of where your inventories are now down to or do you feel there is more reduction required? Then looking it around, how do you think about the industry now on the cost perspective? It would seem like, even globally, that we had seen costs basically moving down for the last two, three years, but now it looks like suddenly they are up meaningfully, especially outside the U.S. on the fiber side. And here, not only on the OCC side as well, but on nat gas. Does that change the way you think that the business dynamics look, at least next year or the year after versus what we saw in the past?", "Jim Porter", "This is Jim. I will take that one. First of all, on our inventories, as I've shared on previous calls, we manage our inventories at a very granular level and the whole purpose of our inventories is to make sure that we're able to provide our customers on time delivery and using the best weight freight. I also said that coming out of our heavy outage period this past couple of quarters, we would be reducing inventories this quarter and that's exactly what we did.", "Frankly, from the February peak, we were down 191,000 tons and quarter-over quarter 152,000, so that's a substantial drop in inventories, as we said we would. Where we're currently, we like our position. The logistics network and our supply chain capabilities have improved dramatically.", "Railcar availability, truck trade availability leads us to a point where we're pretty pleased with where we're currently. There will always be some pluses and minuses and maybe over time, a small incremental further reduction, so I hope that gives you color on that front. Relative to cost, there's no question that we're facing some headwinds on natural gas and fiber and you have normal inflation. However, we also have a nice pipeline of productivity. So we think, overall, our cost structure in our North American container board mill system is one that we have opportunities to further improve.", "The competitiveness globally which I think you were implying is all currency related and certainly we can't control that. So I hope that's germane to your question, Chip.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mark Wilde of Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.", "Mark Wilde", "A - Couple of questions. The first one, Steve, you talked about the interest in more acquisitions going forward. I wondered if you could just help give us some thoughts about where we might see that take place. I know there are always questions about, from a regulatory standpoint, how much bigger you could get in the box board business and maybe in the container board business in North America versus, say, doing more things in Latin America or maybe over in Europe or elsewhere?", "Steve Voorhees", "Sure. We start with looking at acquisitions as we want to do those that improve our business. We do see opportunities in our North American Corrugated and Consumer Packaging businesses. Cenveo was a relatively small transaction. SP Fiber would fit into that. I know you're very familiar with Gondi, Mark. Latin America fits very well with our Company.", "We have a great business in Brazil. We would like to invest more in that. We export 60% of our container board to Latin America, so I would say very natural place for us to grow, so that would remain, outside the U.S., the primary focus. We do have strong operations in Europe and Asia and those we would look at, as well, but the opportunity has to fit our business and has to make our business better.", "Mark Wilde", "Okay. All right. The following question I had, Steve, was just back in the SBS market. You mentioned specifically that you weren't seeing a lot of pressure from Asia and European SBS. I assumed that, that was coming into the U.S. and I just wondered if you could talk about your export business, because when I look at the trade data so far this year, all the SBS-grades are down pretty sharply?", "Steve Voorhees", "I am going to let Jim respond to that, Mark.", "Jim Porter", "As you know, our portfolio of paper board grades is very focused on the premium end of the marketplace, where we're serving the most demanding market segments in tobacco and commercial print, liquid packaging and specialty poly-coated applications. In North America, we compete very well and that's the reason has Steve remarked that we have seen negligible penetration into our markets competing against our premium grades. In the international markets, we use those products in exactly the same way. We have excellent customers in literally all the regions of the world that value our premium substrates and we've seen very consistent demand for those products and we'll see so going forward.", "Steve Voorhees", "Mark, I would add, when I have gone to Europe and Asia and talked to our sales force, they are incredibly talented at taking the needs of the customer and translating it into the specific quality of paper that they need. It is remarkable to me to see what they do. If you look at the overall volumes that we export, it ends up being a more of a -- it's a differentiated business, but it's more of a niche business because we're taking our technology and talent and just serving the precise needs of our customers. So is on point to our strategy.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mark Connelly of CLSA. Your line is open.", "Scott Liebman", "This is Scott Liebman in for Mark. Just a quick question for you. Is WestRock still being as selective in mill reinvestment that it makes on the container board side, similar to RockTenn and how they were? I'm curious as to whether you are selectively reinvestment to strengthen some of the mills but not others has achieved what you wanted thus far? Would you say you are closer to a steady state? Or whether you are still selectively reinvesting with a view to further rationalize the number of mills as one of your big competitors has done pretty successfully in recent years?", "Steve Voorhees", "We have a very rigorous capital investment process within both our mill and our packaging operations. I don't think it's changed from -- you referenced to RockTenn to the present. I don't think there's been any systemic change. We deploy capital to ensure the safety and environmental strength of each of our assets and then we deploy capital to maintain our assets in a highly efficient way. Most of all, we try to tap into the creative opportunities to make our businesses better. It's a very rigorous process that we would see continuing.", "Scott Liebman", "And then just one follow-on. When you did the SP Fiber deal, you said you expected significant synergies and for the deal to be accretive in the second half of this year and you've obviously changed the footprint there since the transaction was made. Was that part of the original plan and do you still think that SP will be accretive in the second half? And just overall in that transaction, are you getting the benefits that you expected?", "Steve Voorhees", "We're getting the benefits we expected. Newberg was not a significant contributor to the overall economics of the transaction. Dublin is the assets that fits very well into our system. We did come up with a -- for Dublin, if you look at the -- say, the productivity improvements that we expected over the first three years, our goal at the time we announced the transaction was $41 million.", "We're now, after less than one year, we're at $40 million. So we're not quite at what we achieved, but we're effectively there and then we have line of sight to $46 million and more. We took our Board there last week and the mill looked great. The people looked better. The production is on track. It is a good fit in our system.", "We're selling a new product for us in recycled craft bag them and that has worked very well. Our productivity programs are in place and the mill continues to fit very well in our system. So this is -- right now, it has worked out better than we anticipated at the time we announced the transaction.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Anthony Pettinari of Citi. Your line is open.", "Anthony Pettinari", "I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about market conditions in Brazil. Your box shipments declined in the quarter for you and the industry. Are you seeing any stabilization or maybe improvement there in terms of local demand or do you expect it in the second half? And then, to the extent that you can, can you talk a little bit about the price increase that was announced there?", "Ward Dickson", "Brazil is, first of all, an incredible asset for us. The forest land, the Tres Barras Mill is state-of-the-art and our integrated packaging portfolio is a great business for us and is performing extremely well. We're all well aware of the political and economic challenges in Brazil and I don't know that I could necessarily predict the trend line going forward on that whole thing, but I would say it will improve over time. I'm just not sure the pace of that.", "Relative to our ability to compete, we have superior assets and the quality and capability of both our container board and the products coming out of our converting system are winning in the marketplace. So, as the economy improves, we're going to win. The beauty is, we also have a very low cost mill that is able to toggle between domestic consumption and export, so you've seen our export shipments increase over time. Net/net, I love our position in Brazil.", "Anthony Pettinari", "Okay. Then following up on that, it seems like there's a lot of local producers there who might be much higher cost and OCC prices have come up pretty sharply there. When you think about rejace's market position within Brazil over this very deep recession, have you been gaining share? Have there been smaller local guys who have dropped out? Any color you can give on the market dynamics there maybe over the last year, 1.5 years?", "Steve Voorhees", "I don't know that I can speak to our competitors falling out. I just know I love our position. We have a premium virgin product coming out of the state-of-the-art mill that's vertically integrated with a great packaging system and a forest resource that makes us very low cost. So I like our position.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Scott Gaffner of Barclays.", "Scott Gaffner", "Steve, just to go back as a follow-up question on this new business pipeline, has there been any change in the way that you approach the sales team, are we up against easy comps over last year, anything you could talk to about the go-to-market strategy that would have any consequence on that would be great? The only reason I ask is because you go from the minus 2% in the quarter to 1.7% in July. That seems to be a pretty big inflection point?", "Steve Voorhees", "We worked into the call comments, that over the past year, this fiscal year, our volumes are up slightly. We do not focus on, call it, quarter-to quarter or month-to-month changes in our volumes. I know the investment community does, so we, in turn, have to focus on it, but we're focusing on building a Company that is very profitable and generates long term cash flows. So we're very focused in container, but we have just a very structured way to go to market.", "If you come to work at WestRock, you go through a certain training and we go to market and a very consistent way. Then we're in the process of, I'd say, rolling that out broader, more fully across WestRock and we're in a position to do that. I just came across something that Gallup, they have an email that they send out periodically that covers us all sorts of different topics. They sent one out yesterday and their conclusion was they find most companies can double their revenue by simply selling more to the existing customer base. I just repeat that because that's really on point to what we're doing.", "Most of our customers will buy folding cartons, they will buy boxes and we're taking our sales force and we're going to market to identify those customers we can go through and add value to. That's a long-winded answer to your question, but I am very pleased with what we're doing.", "We're building that capability over the long term. Our volumes will go up or down from quarter-to quarter, but if you look at the overall portfolio of business we're generating, it's a very attractive portfolio of business. I am going to go on because we're supplementing that with capital.", "So in Container, we've been very clear about the investment we're doing with respect to the EVOLs. As part of our capital budget process we talked about earlier, we go back and look at all of our capital as to whether it does what we thought it was going to do. At least in Container, as part of this process, we reviewed $80 million in capital projects in our Box business and a lot of them were EVOLs but there were other projects, as well. The actual cost was within 1% of what we thought it was going to be. The actual returns, we estimated at 15% after tax; the actuals were 20%. So they were well in excess of what we thought when we made the investment. So we have, I'll just say, full-court press across our business to go to market in a way which is very for perfect us and then back that up with the investment in capital and talent to make the business -- we will create a lot of value over the long term by doing that.", "Scott Gaffner", "Okay. Just one clarifying point there then. Are you saying that the pipeline looks better maybe year-over-year because you're finding opportunities to go out to Consumer Packaging customers that you didn't have maybe a year ago and sell them some of your Corrugated Packaging? Then I will turn it back over? Thanks.", "Steve Voorhees", "That's a contributing factor. The answer is yes. It's not the only factor, but it is a contributing factor.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Adam Josephson of KeyBanc. Your line is open.", "Adam Josephson", "Ward, two questions from me. The first is a multi-part question, if you don't mind, on free cash flow. Can you just talk about what the source of the FY16 free cash flow increase was? Was it working capital, CapEx, EBITDA or otherwise? And then -- and can you clarify what, Ward, you are expecting working capital to contribute to free cash this year?", "And lastly, with respect to free cash, your initial FY16 free cash guidance was $850 million which included chemicals. Now you are saying, for next year it will be $725 million to $750 million, obviously excluding chemicals. How much of the difference is chemicals versus other? And thank you for all those responses.", "Ward Dickson", "Adam, I will start with the second one, first. We had capital investments from our specialty chemicals business of approximately $45 million during the period of time that they were part of WestRock prior to the spin, so that is your reference point on the second point. If I go back and I look at the free cash flow guidance that we gave earlier in the year, a lot of things have changed. We've had pricing changes in the marketplace; we have had inflationary pressures. If I were to give you the reference points of why we're going to generate the higher cash flow or come out on the higher end of the range, earnings are better, our working capital source that we talked about at that point in time is actually lower.", "The other cash items, such as cash taxes, they are very consistent with the assumption that we laid out back earlier in the year. Then CapEx is clearly on the lower end of the range that we had identified at the beginning of the year. We will even come in just below the $825 million that we had described. So again, it's earnings, working capital is not as big of a use as we described back then, the remaining balance sheet items are fairly consistent and then lower CapEx.", "Adam Josephson", "Just one on the sequential guidance, I know you called out the $10 million lower income from land, the $11 million of higher outages in consumer, you had higher input costs, you had flat to slightly down price mix. Can you give us any more sense of the magnitude of the sequential decline that you are expecting?", "Ward Dickson", "We spelled out the two items that add up to $21 million and you can look at our natural gas usage in our recycled fiber and look at the changes in the strips and then the change in OCC. It is pretty straightforward how you calculate that. We do have some residual price mix flow-through from the PPW reductions that took place earlier in the year that does occur in Q4, but we're not giving specific EPS guidance for the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. That concludes today's conference. That you for participating. You may now disconnect.", "Matt Tractenberg", "Thank you, Nicole. Thank you to our audience for joining us this morning. We're proud of our progress and appreciate your interest in WestRock. If you have questions following the call, investor relations is happy to help you. We can be reached at ir.westrock.com.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point.", "I would now like to turn the call over to your host, to Matt Tractenberg. Sir, you may begin.", "Matthew Tractenberg", "Thank you, Dexter. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter earnings call. My name is Matt Tractenberg. I'm WestRock's Vice President of Investor Relations. I'm joined this morning by Steve Voorhees, WestRock's Chief Executive Officer; Ward Dickson, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Porter, President of Business Development & Latin America; Jeff Chalovich, President of Corrugated Packaging; and Bob Feeser, President of our Consumer Packaging segment.", "During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we discuss during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the SEC, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015.", "Additionally, we will be referencing adjusted or non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We've provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation. The slide presentation is available on our website.", "So, with that said, I'll turn it over to you, Steve.", "Steven Voorhees", "Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. September marked the end of our first fiscal year at WestRock. We've had an exciting and productive year. We've made considerable progress in building WestRock into what we are today. We're a $14 billion paper and packaging company. We hold leading positions across a broad set of markets. We're providing our customers with tailor-made solutions that help them win in their markets.", "We're executing our strategic plan and delivering excellent results. After only five quarters, we're already halfway toward our $1 billion three-year synergy and performance improvement target. Over the same five quarters, we've delivered $444 million in productivity improvements. We manage our business to sustain and grow our cash flows over the long-term.", "During fiscal 2016, we delivered over $1 billion in adjusted free cash flow. We returned $716 million to stockholders through $381 million in dividends and $335 million in share repurchases. To-date, we've bought back 13.5 million shares or 5% of WestRock's outstanding shares. We improved our business by investing $588 million in two acquisitions and one joint venture. Our balance sheet is in great shape with a leverage ratio of 2.33 times.", "On Friday, we announced a $0.10 per share increase to our annual dividend. The dividend increase underscores our confidence in our long-term cash flows. We have ample capacity to reinvest in our existing facilities. We have the flexibility to make acquisitions that improve our business and generate attractive returns. We will continue to purchase WestRock shares and expect to hold leverage within our targeted range of 2.25 times to 2.5 times.", "Sales for the quarter were $3.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $589 million for a margin of 16.3%. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.71. Productivity initiatives contributed $89 million to our income during the quarter. We transferred $2.5 billion of pension assets and liabilities to a third-party.", "This transaction significantly de-risked our U.S. qualified pension plan. For the full year, sales were $14 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $2.3 billion for a margin of 16%. We achieved our productivity and cash flow objectives in fiscal 2016 and we've set the stage for a very successful 2017.", "The Corrugated Packaging team delivered solid results in the quarter, including North American adjusted EBITDA margins of 18.2%. Adjusted EBITDA declined by $31 million from the prior year and was flat sequentially. As we said would happen on last quarter's call, the Pulp & Paper Week price reduction from earlier this year continues to flow through this quarter. This is true for both our box and domestic containerboard businesses.", "We reduced inventory by 143,000 tons from a year ago and we reduced inventories 16,000 tons sequentially. We took 32,000 tons of maintenance downtime in the quarter. Most of this downtime was at our Stevenson mill, where we completed our capital project to convert to a new pulping process. This scheduled outage of the Stevenson mill reduced income by $10 million.", "We've communicated a $50 per ton price increase to our customers for domestic containerboard and corrugated packaging. Export pricing has improved in our largest markets, including Latin America, where pricing was up $8 per ton sequentially. Our system has been and continues to be tied with good demand, low inventories and high operating rates.", "Within our box business, backlogs have strengthened and our current pipeline of new business remains strong. Our differentiated strategy is earning us new business. In October, our box volumes were up 1.6% over last year on a daily basis.", "Turning to Hurricane Matthew, I'm pleased to report that our employees came through Hurricane Matthew with no injuries. We have had several employees and their families with damage to their homes. And some of these employees are receiving support from the WestRock Employee Relief Fund. The impact of Hurricane Matthew on our business has reduced production by 35,000 tons.", "We've reduced shipments to export markets to help meet our improving demand, as well as address the lower production due to Hurricane Matthew.", "Grupo Gondi sales in the quarter were $180 million and EBITDA margins exceeded 20%. We shipped 55,000 tons of containerboard to the Grupo Gondi joint venture. And we expect shipments to increase going forward, as Gondi grows its business. Lastly, Gondi completed the acquisition of Aluprint, a leading manufacturer of folding cartons in Mexico.", "This acquisition adds additional capabilities for Gondi to serve customers in the growing Mexican packaging market. In Brazil, our team performed exceptionally well despite continued regional economic challenges. Box shipments per day were up by approximately 9% over the prior year and up 4% sequentially. EBITDA margins were 26.4%.", "Jim Porter is working with the team in Brazil. And I expect that they will create attractive investment opportunities for WestRock over the next year. Jim continues to advise us on the North American containerboard business, as Jeff Chalovich has assumed the responsibility of leading this business for WestRock.", "Jeff brings over 25 years of industry experience to WestRock. He joined RockTenn in 2008 when we acquired Southern Container. He's been leading our $5 billion box business for the past four years. Over the same period, we've improved our North American Corrugated Packaging EBITDA margins from 13% to 18%. Jeff's leadership has driven much of this improvement and we have more runway to increase margins.", "I'm looking forward to supporting our entire Corrugated Packaging team to deliver even better results through the execution of our differentiated strategy. Consumer Packaging delivered improved earnings and margins in the quarter. Net sales were $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $268 million. We delivered $42 million in productivity improvements. This drove our 90-basis-point increase in adjusted EBITDA margins.", "Folding carton revenue grew by 10% year-over-year driven by the Cenveo Packaging acquisition and organic growth of 2% in our core North American business. We're making good progress on productivity initiatives across our converting businesses. Pricing and mix were favorable, primarily due to lower pulp volumes. This was partially offset by the flow through of previously published index reductions for SBS and CRB.", "Our SBS backlogs have strengthened and are currently at five weeks. We produced less pulp at our SBS mills in the quarter. This was a result of improved paper board demand and planned maintenance outages of the Covington and Demopolis mills. We're seeing limited penetration from European and Asian board suppliers that's been targeting the U.S. market.", "Finally, sequentially, both our CRB and CNK backlog have increased and both are approximately three weeks. Bob Feeser leads our Consumer Packaging business. Bob's career started at Mead about 30 years ago. His known converting experience includes consumer, corrugated, domestic and international assignments.", "Bob has as broad set of experiences as any executive at WestRock. Bob's been instrumental in delivering more than $230 million in productivity improvements in the Consumer Packaging business. Our Consumer Packaging business is successfully implementing our differentiated strategy. I look forward to supporting the business in their drive to improve margins.", "Home, Health & Beauty. Our Home, Health & Beauty business has been performing extremely well over the past few years. Fiscal 2016, our sales were $567 million. EBITDA was in excess of $100 million. Capital expenditures have been less than 5% of sales. The business has generated very strong cash flows that have grown \u2013 that we expect to continue to grow over the next several years.", "The entire Home, Health & Beauty organization deserves recognition for what they have accomplished since the merger and many years before the merger. While the businesses fit well with WestRock's portfolio of packaging solutions, publicly-held peers of Home, Health & Beauty are valued at higher multiples than WestRock overall. And, in fact, our Home, Health & Beauty business may fit even better with another company.", "Accordingly, our board has authorized us to evaluate strategic alternatives for the Home, Health & Beauty business. These alternatives include the potential sale of the business during the first half of calendar 2017. In the event we sell the business for cash, we expect to use the sale proceeds consistent with our balanced capital allocation strategy.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Ward.", "Ward Dickson", "Thank you, Steve. We're making great progress on monetizing our land and development portfolio. We completed the $13 million after-tax sale of a residential apartment complex during the quarter. As discussed on our previous call, we expect to realize one-half of the $275 million to $300 million in net after-tax free cash flow during fiscal 2017.", "As Steve indicated, we continue to execute very well on our synergy and performance improvement objectives. We exited the September quarter in an annual run rate of $500 million. Fiscal 2016 productivity was driven by insourcing initiatives, procurement, actions to rationalize our footprint, return generating capital investments and merger-related synergies. We expect to achieve an $800 million run rate by the end of fiscal year 2017 and remain on track to achieve our $1 billion goal by the end of fiscal 2018.", "Fourth quarter adjusted segment EBITDA declined by $27 million, driven in part by unfavorable volume, the anticipated impact of price and mix and inflation of both input cost and labor. The impact of these three items was nearly offset by ongoing productivity improvements.", "On a full year basis, combined company adjusted EBITDA declined by $51 million, driven by lower volume and favorable price and mix, wage and other input cost inflation. However, we were able to offset much of these items by delivering $384 million of productivity improvements.", "In summary, both the quarter and the full fiscal year were successful. And I'd like to thank all of our employees for making this happen. As we look back at the first five quarters of WestRock, we have allocated $2.8 billion of capital. We have invested over $1 billion in capital expenditures over the last 15 months and continue to seeing numerous attractive return generating opportunities.", "We returned $1.14 billion or almost half of the total to stockholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. This return of cash to stockholders via dividends and share buybacks will continue to be an important part of our capital allocation strategy.", "In the first quarter, we expect sequential earnings will be lower, in line with the seasonal pattern we experienced last year. I'd like to remind you that from Q4 fiscal 2015 to Q1 fiscal 2016 segment income declined by $88 million. We have outlined several of the drivers of the first quarter and full year on slide 12. For Q1, we anticipate that price and mix will be negative as the impact of the previously announced corrugated price increase will be more than offset by the flow through of the previously published consumer price decreases.", "The first quarter is typically our heaviest maintenance period. And we're planning 160,000 tons of downtime. Volumes will likely decline, driven by four less shipping days in our container business. Consumer grade experienced seasonal softness in the first quarter as well. Inflation of input prices will continue in the period.", "And, finally, Hurricane Matthew will negatively impact us by approximately $15 million to $20 million. These items should lead you to a first quarter adjusted EPS lower than what we delivered in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, but increasing steadily as we make our way through the year.", "For the full year of fiscal 2017, we expect to deliver adjusted free cash flow of $1.2 billion, including approximately $150 million of land and development after-tax cash flow. We expect to invest approximately $750 million in CapEx. We also expect to realize significant productivity, as well as meaningful inflation in some commodity categories, including natural gas, recycled fiber and certain chemicals. Book tax rates are estimated at 34% to 35% and cash tax rates are in the high 20%s.", "Steve, I will hand it back to you for closing comments.", "Steven Voorhees", "Thanks Ward. I'm proud of the progress we've made in our first full year as WestRock. WestRock offers a comprehensive portfolio of paper and packaging products and services. This portfolio provides WestRock the opportunity to deliver winning solutions to our customers that help them win in their markets. We're doing just that. This is and will translate into great value for our customers, our employees and our stockholders.", "We exceeded our productivity and free cash flow targets in fiscal year 2016. And we're looking forward to continued success in fiscal 2017. Our cash flow is the foundation of our balanced capital allocation program, investing our business through capital improvements and acquisitions and returning value to stockholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases. And, as important as anything else, we have a terrific team and strategy. We're looking forward to driving even greater value creation in the future.", "Matt, back to you.", "Matthew Tractenberg", "Thanks, Steve. I'd like to remind the audience that in the interest of time, please limit your questions to one with a single follow-up, if needed. We'll take as many as time allows. Dexter, please open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And now, our first question comes from the line of Mark Wilde of Bank of Montreal. You may now ask your question.", "Mark Wilde", "Yeah. Ward, I wondered if you could \u2013 good morning. I wondered if you could help us a little bit more on the free cash flow guidance because it seems like between kind of CapEx down about $50 million, $150 million from land and development and $300 million from additional synergies you've got more tailwind than your current free cash guidance would suggest.", "Ward Dickson", "Sure. Let me walk you through the details of the $1.2 billion. I'll really highlight three things. You're right. We do have the contribution of $150 million from land and development versus a small use from land and development in fiscal 2015. In earnings, we have modeled in the implementation of the containerboard price increase. That's partially offset by the full year impact of the flow through of the previously announced PPW decreases in some of our consumer grades, along with the negative impact of input cost inflation. So, if you take our current pricings for some of our key raw materials and you compare that to the average of those prices in 2016, you can easily model between $175 million and $200 million of inflation on a year-over-year basis.", "Our working capital and other balance sheet items should be a source as we expand some of our payment terms with our vendors through our supply chain financing programs. The other thing that I would also call out is that we've got some non-cash related earnings. I think we highlighted at the equity and non-consolidated affiliates. That's Gondi and it's also the portion of our land and development holdings that are not \u2013 where we don't have a consolidating interest. And we highlighted that as a negative $60 million for the full year.", "Mark Wilde", "Okay. And just, if I could, as a follow-on, just on this containerboard pricing front. I know it's a sensitive issue, but I'm just curious. Earlier in the year, there was a decline of about $15 in the linerboard price series in Pulp & Paper Week and there was a lot of talk that that wasn't large enough to trigger any contract adjustments in the box business. So, now with the containerboard price hike much more than that, I'm just trying to figure out whether there's any kind of a netting effect of the two.", "Steven Voorhees", "Jeff?", "Jeffrey Chalovich", "Hey, Mark. So, we have -", "Mark Wilde", "Hey, Jeff.", "Jeffrey Chalovich", "A multitude of contracts and trigger mechanisms literally in thousands of customers, over 15,000 customers. So, we're not going to comment generally on that. We have communicated the $50 a ton price increase to our customer base and we will report on future calls on the progress.", "Mark Wilde", "Okay. Fair enough. Thanks. I'll turn it over.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America. You may now ask your question.", "George Staphos", "Thanks. Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the details. My first question \u2013 what I'll do is I'll piggyback off of Mark's question on pricing and again recognizing it's not necessarily something you like to talk about in a public forum. Can you give us a little bit more color in terms of the aggregate pricing benefit or actually reduction that you're thinking about in the fiscal first quarter? Directionally, we know containerboard is up and we know you have the flow through on the consumer side that's negative. Is there a way to parse those and, if not, just aggregate those in terms of what we should be thinking about given today's pricing? That's my first question.", "Second question, a totally different topic on Home, Health & Beauty. We're not terribly surprised by the announcement. We thought this is a good business within the whole of WestRock. But, in the past, Steve, you've talked about being a packaging company and dispensing systems being part of being a packaging company. Has there been anything that's changed in your view? Perhaps it's just valuation multiples. Does that suggest now is a better time to look to explore the valuation arbitrage, if you will, on that business? Thank you.", "Steven Voorhees", "George, on dispensing, it has fit well with us. I think you answered the question by saying its valuation multiples.", "George Staphos", "Do I get another one then? Just kidding.", "Steven Voorhees", "Yeah. So, Ward, take the first question.", "Ward Dickson", "So, George, on the first question on pricing, sequentially from Q4 to Q1, we said down slightly with \u2013 we will see some of the initial benefits of the containerboard price increase, but we will also see the continued flow through of the PPW reductions on the consumer grades. And, again, it'll be a small net negative between the two.", "George Staphos", "Okay. I'll turn it over. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson of KeyBanc. You may now ask your question.", "Adam Josephson", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Ward, one more on the guidance. I know Mark asked you about the cash flow guidance. Can you talk about the implied EBITDA guidance based on everything you laid out in that guidance slide? Are you expecting full year EBITDA to be up or down relative to the $227 million that you generated this year?", "Ward Dickson", "It should be up. The primary drivers of the EBITDA change \u2013 we will continue productivity. The productivity won't be as high as it was in this fiscal year because we have the benefit of some of the merger related synergies in the first year. We will have more pressure related to inflation. And I size the input cost inflation and I'd remind you of the $120 million to $125 million worth of labor inflation that we have on top of it. So, we will be moving from a \u2013 as you look at the full year FY 2016 bridge where the net commodity deflation and wage inflation was only a negative $50 million, it's going to be considerably more unfavorable on a year-over-year basis. Productivity will be \u2013 you should expect productivity in the $325 million to $350 million range for next year. And then, we will have the pricing flow through in the containerboard, which will be partially offset by the full year impact of the PPW reduction from the consumer grades.", "Adam Josephson", "Okay. Just as a follow-on, I assume Home, Health & Beauty is in your full year cash flow and EBITDA \u2013 cash flow guidance?", "Ward Dickson", "It is. And it's \u2013 again, I would reference some of the key facts that Steve gave you. It's approximately just north of $100 million worth of EBITDA. Their CapEx is approximately 5% of sales. And so, we estimate that the free cash flow for the full year is around $60 million.", "Adam Josephson", "And that's included in the $1.2 billion?", "Ward Dickson", "That's included in the $1.2 billion.", "Adam Josephson", "Thanks a lot, Ward.", "Ward Dickson", "I would highlight, as you look at FY 2017 versus FY 2016, we also had a small source, less than $30 million, ultimately, from Ingevity in 2016. That was included in the full year number. And so, that obviously doesn't recur and shows that the underlying free cash flow of the business increases year-over-year.", "Adam Josephson", "Thank you, Ward.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub of Buckingham Research. You may now ask your question.", "Mark Weintraub", "Thank you. I'm curious as to your sense how the corrugated market is feeling and this price increase is feeling relative to prior price increases that you have put through?", "Steven Voorhees", "Yes. Jeff?", "Jeffrey Chalovich", "Hey, Mark. So, currently, the industry fundamentals are really solid. Box demand is up 2.3% year-over-year in September and 1.6% year-to-date on an absolute basis. Consumption is up 2.8%. AF&PA inventories are down 272,000 tons year-over-year September. And inventories are sitting at 3.8 weeks. Operating rates are strong and high at 95.9%. And these are the highest we've seen since those times. So, fundamentals are very good.", "Our system is extremely tight. We're having to repatriate tons out of the export market to meet our domestic demand and customers. Orders for our domestic containerboard are and are solid, about 95,000 tons year-over-year and 24,000 tons sequentially. So, we see the market fundamentals as strong and very good.", "Mark Weintraub", "And relative to prior increases is the \u2013 the way it's going, does it feel very similar? And just as a tag on, Pulp & Paper Week had put out a piece this weekend suggesting that the export price increases, even to Latin America, were, at least from their perspective, not really getting any traction. Do you disagree with that?", "Jeffrey Chalovich", "So, the first part of that is, I think, it's very similar from the last time from what I'd recall. The industry fundamentals are solid. And I think that's what we're experiencing.", "Mark Weintraub", "And on the export question?", "Jeffrey Chalovich", "I'm sorry. What was the export question?", "Mark Weintraub", "Pulp & Paper Week put out an article this weekend suggesting that the price increases to the export markets hadn't really been gaining traction. I did note you said that your prices were up $8 versus the prior quarter. But the current initiative \u2013 do you disagree with that assessment? Do you still feel that you have a good chance of getting traction on those price increases into the export markets?", "Jeffrey Chalovich", "We're communicating directly with our customers. Like I said, we're repatriating tons and we are communicating directly with customers on our pricing stance with them.", "Mark Weintraub", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. You may now ask your question.", "Brian Maguire", "Hi. Good morning, guys.", "Steven Voorhees", "Good morning.", "Brian Maguire", "I just want to follow-up on the potential sale of Home, Health & Beauty. Just wondering if \u2013 what would be the priorities for uses of cash there? And maybe as part of that, you could just address the M&A landscape as you see it these days and what part of the portfolio you'd want to be reinvesting at this point?", "Steven Voorhees", "Sure. Whatever proceeds we get, we'll insert into our balanced capital allocation strategy. And we'll look at the relative merits of the alternatives we have at that time. I'd say M&A landscape is \u2013 I think we have a good deal flow across all of our businesses, so both in consumer and corrugated. And so, that's where we are.", "Brian Maguire", "Okay. Just as a follow-up. Just wanted to ask about the strength in the card in organic growth. I think it was up 2%. Maybe you could just dig into which grades and applications you're seeing the most strength in and how you kind of view inventories in that part of the business and just kind of the outlook for demand heading into fiscal 2017. Thanks.", "Steven Voorhees", "Yes. Bob?", "Robert Feeser", "Yeah. Hi, Brian. This is Bob Feeser. We're seeing stable demand across many of our consumer grades. As Ward mentioned, we will see the flow through on the published SBS and CRB reductions. But our demand is holding up well. We would expect to see normal seasonality in the December quarter. As we announced, our backlogs for SBS have improved to five weeks and CRB and CNK have improved to three weeks. So, demand is holding up well. CRB is probably one area that's a bit more pressured. But, overall, we're looking at a normal first quarter.", "Brian Maguire", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones of Deutsche Bank. You may now ask your question.", "Debbie Jones", "Hi. Good morning.", "Steven Voorhees", "Good morning.", "Debbie Jones", "I wanted to talk about the $800 million in performance improvements, the incremental $300 million from the $500 million you've already got. Can you just talk about how difficult or different it will be to achieve those versus the initial $500 million?", "Steven Voorhees", "Yes. Debbie, Ward will take that one.", "Ward Dickson", "Hi, Debbie.", "Debbie Jones", "Hey, Ward.", "Ward Dickson", "What we've recognized so far we certainly have had the benefits of the merger related synergies, the reduction in the duplicate order costs. But I also highlighted the fact that we have internalized close to 250,000 tons in our consumer system. So, as we start to lap those benefits and move into FY 2017, the role of the procurement organization will continue to generate a third of those savings during FY 2017. We still have about half of the remaining SG&A reductions which are related to IP projects that will also occur during FY 2017.", "Capital investments in our system to return generating capital investments will play a larger role. And then we will also get the full year benefit of some of the footprint actions that we have made across both systems. So, we will transition away from the merger related synergies related to the internalization. And then, we'll be more focused on capital and investments that were in return generating projects, procurement, and then just the other ongoing performance improvement programs that we have across the whole company.", "Debbie Jones", "Okay. Are these more skewed towards Consumer or Corrugated?", "Ward Dickson", "In fiscal 2016, it was more skewed to Consumer because of the internalization opportunities that we had as a result of the merger. As we move into fiscal 2017, it will be more balanced between the two businesses.", "Debbie Jones", "Okay. And just one more in this, the inflationary range you called out, $175 million to $200 million, is that just from raw materials or does that also include general cost inflation?", "Ward Dickson", "Debbie that was just raw materials. And what I simply did was I took current prices for some of our key commodities and compared it to the average for 2016. And then, on top of that, you should anticipate that we would have the normal wage and benefit inflation that I've highlighted in the $125 million a year range.", "Debbie Jones", "Great. Thank you. That's helpful.", "Ward Dickson", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari of Citi. You may now ask your question.", "Anthony Pettinari", "Good morning.", "Steven Voorhees", "Good morning.", "Anthony Pettinari", "In your guidance, you indicated you were planning downtime in Consumer Packaging in 1Q and 3Q. And I was wondering if it's possible to say which grades you're taking that downtime. And then just zooming in on CRB, we saw the price cut in September. What drove that and what's driven maybe a little bit more of a weaker environment in CRB in your eyes?", "Steven Voorhees", "Yes. Bob?", "Robert Feeser", "Yeah. Anthony, the downtime that we've highlighted is maintenance downtime related just to normal mill outages that we have both in the first quarter as well as the third quarter.", "Anthony Pettinari", "Okay. Is that spread across all three grades?", "Robert Feeser", "Well, yes. It's spread between \u2013 primarily what you're seeing is SBS and CNK, a little bit in the CRB business, but it's mostly SBS and CNK.", "Anthony Pettinari", "Okay. And then, in terms of CRB and the price decline in September, did that surprise you? And is there a reason that CRB seems a little bit weaker than the other two grades? At least from the outside it looks that way.", "Robert Feeser", "Yes. I would say that it was a bit of a surprise, although, again, we continue to see the fundamentals in CRB a little bit more challenging with the dry food market which is well published in terms of weaker demand in some of the processed foods, dry foods in particular. I think that is what's primarily contributing to a little bit of a weaker environment in CRB.", "Anthony Pettinari", "Okay. That's helpful. And then just maybe one last one on containerboard. Understanding you can't discuss forward pricing. In the past when you've implemented price hikes, is it possible to say how many months it typically takes to realize the full flow through of the price hike?", "Jeffrey Chalovich", "No. Again, we've communicated the increase to our customers and we will provide more color on future calls.", "Anthony Pettinari", "Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Ng of Jefferies. You may now ask your question.", "Philip Ng", "Hey, guys. Box shipment to North America held up pretty well and it seems like things have picked up a bit in October. Just curious to get your thoughts. What's driving the resiliency? Any end markets that really stand out? And are you starting to see some of the initiatives that you made on the commercial front really flowing through a little more fully right now?", "Jeffrey Chalovich", "Yes. I think that's a fair representation. We are seeing our Ag markets up year-over-year. We have strong dairy. Some of our retail e-commerce is significantly up for us. And then our food service packaging business, which is our pizza business, and the company businesses that go with the pizza, so some of our clam shells and things that we ship with that, are up year-over-year. So, our demand and backlogs are very good going into the season. And we are seeing some of the commercial efforts that we've worked on pay off and really driving the differentiated solutions. And we have the most comprehensive portfolio of paper and packaging products. And driving solutions with innovation is really paying off with our customers.", "Steven Voorhees", "And, Phil \u2013 go ahead, Phil.", "Philip Ng", "No. Please carry on.", "Steven Voorhees", "Okay. Phil, I was going to add back on to Jeff's comments. We've formed an Enterprise Solutions Group. And their job is to connect our customers to the full breadth of our product and service offerings, whether it's Corrugated or Consumer. We're in the early stages of doing this. It's been very well received by our customers and we're recognizing new business opportunities from \u2013 I think we've put out a release on those a month or two months ago. Craig Gunckel leads the group. And Craig's got 20 years of experience with us and he has a long track record of delivering sales growth across several of our businesses. So, this is a very important thing for our company over the long-term.", "Philip Ng", "Okay. That's really helpful color. And, Steve, that was actually one of my segues. Is there a bigger opportunity in Consumer or Corrugated in terms of some of these commercial initiatives? Or is it equally price lift, I guess?", "Steven Voorhees", "It's balanced. The portfolio fits very well together and we're able to go to our consumers agnostically between Consumer or Corrugated, different paper grades, to put together a tailor-made solution for their needs. So, our portfolio really fits well together.", "Philip Ng", "Okay. And just one last one on the corrugated side of things. Jeff, can you provide \u2013 I mean, you commented in the prepared remarks that backlog has certainly firmed up a bit in containerboard. Can you give us a sense how many weeks it in the quarter? How does that stack up year-over-year or sequentially? And good luck in the quarter. Thanks.", "Jeffrey Chalovich", "I'm sorry. Can you ask that again on the backlogs?", "Philip Ng", "Sure. You talked about containerboard backlogs have extended and firmed up a bit in fiscal fourth quarter. Can you just kind of frame how many weeks that was? How does that stack up either sequentially or on a year-over-year basis? That would be helpful.", "Jeffrey Chalovich", "I can just tell you that we track on our backlogs in box really five days and 10 days rolling. And so, we see the backlogs building on our five days. The lead times are very short there. And then we're booking a month out through our supply chain. So the backlogs remain strong or up sequentially for us.", "Philip Ng", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly of CLSA. You may now ask your question.", "Mark Connelly", "Thanks. Steve, I've just got one question. You said you saw about 2% organic growth in folding carton. Do you think that is a sustainable growth rate? And when you think about your willingness to acquire any opportunities, what do you think is a realistic top-line opportunity for folding carton over the next couple of years?", "Steven Voorhees", "Mark, I'm going to let Bob answer that.", "Robert Feeser", "Yes. Hey, Mark. We really like our position in folding carton. As we indicated, we saw 10% growth in the fourth quarter, driven by the Cenveo acquisition, but also the 2% organic growth. And we really believe that we're outpacing the industry in terms of overall growth that's flat to down. We've got a solid growth pipeline overall that we're executing against. It's a very well-run business. We're driving good productivity improvements. And we're continuing to make good investments and creating more capabilities in that business. So, we feel quite good about how we're positioned in folding carton.", "Steven Voorhees", "And then, Mark, I'll add. The business is \u2013 the majority of the business is food and beverage. And those trends have affected folding carton. I think our business, where we're integrated across all of our paper grades, we have the opportunity to, I think, grow organically probably faster than the industry, because of the breadth of offering we have in folding carton. We can offer CRB, SBS, and CNK.", "Mark Connelly", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel of Wells Fargo Securities. You may now ask your question.", "Chris Manuel", "Good morning, gentlemen. I wanted to kind of come back to probably your least favorite topic you've had this morning and that's price-oriented stuff. But I've heard you very carefully on a couple, four or five instances thus far say you've communicated with your customers a $50 ton price increase. I just wanted to kind of dive into that a little. As you sit today the beginning here of November, are you \u2013 you've communicated with customers. Are you, in fact, billing and receiving payments back for what you've put through? And then traditionally, that would equate to something, I don't know, 8%, 10% range as we think at downstream products. Are in you, in fact, communicated with them and billing and receiving for that as well?", "Jeffrey Chalovich", "So, we went to the market on box with a 10% and 12% communicated increase. And, well, we announced and communicated with our customers the $50 on October 1 in board and began billing the $50 ton increase on October 1.", "Chris Manuel", "Okay. That's very helpful. Second question I want to ask was it kind of comes back around to integration levels and in export and that type of stuff. So, I think, I heard you mention earlier, Jeff, that you were repatriating some board. But I was kind of thinking your integration rates were in the mid-upper 60%s. Can you kind of help me with where you sit today? Or maybe what you're talking about there? And then when we're thinking about those export markets, there've been some price announced there. It hasn't seen to gain a lot of traction. Do you think that that's something that over the next, call it, six months to 12 months we could see export prices come up as well? Thank you.", "Jeffrey Chalovich", "Sure. So, we are in the upper 60%s integration level. And if you look at some of the JVs we have where we have paper agreements, we're into the low 70%s. And so we look continually at our channel mix and how to increase in integration. Export is a part of our channels. We are repatriating paper and bringing it into the domestic market because of the strong demand we have in our box and domestic markets. We will and have communicated with our customers and the export markets. We did note that some of our prices on our large areas is up. And, again, we are communicating directly with them on pricing.", "Chris Manuel", "Thank you. Best wishes for the rest of the year.", "Jeffrey Chalovich", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon of Vertical Research Partners. You may now ask your question.", "Chip Dillon", "Yes and good morning, gentlemen.", "Steven Voorhees", "Good morning.", "Chip Dillon", "First question has to do with \u2013 you mentioned in the slides the strategic options you're looking at for Home, Health & Beauty. And if I kind of interpolate from pre-acquisition, it would seem like the EBITDA there is probably in the range of $130 million or so and maybe revenues of $750 million, $800 million. Is that the rough ballpark as we think about what the prospects are for that business?", "Steven Voorhees", "We said $500 million and some odd of sales and EBITDA of over $100 million. With the merger, they had some folding carton business that we have integrated into our folding carton business, so that would account for the difference.", "Chip Dillon", "Okay. That's helpful. You're missing some sales, but not much EBITDA, it sounds like. And then, a second question, just looking at the industry, in general, it's been almost a record period, three-and-a-half years, since we saw Corrugated prices move up in North America. And one thing I've seen and recall in the past is when you've had a long period of time, unless whether it's your box plant managers looking at it at their own P&L level or your independent customers. We've had a long time where they have not had the opportunity to offset naturally rising cost like healthcare cost or the fact that people might get paid a little more every year.", "And so my question is shall we read into the announced box price increase? I think you mentioned 10% to 12%. Some opportunity to capture some of those \u2013 to offset some of those cost increases, so that if I'm an independent player, I might actually see my realizations go up more than $50 because, obviously, if I'm paying $50 more for board, I need more than that to offset these other costs.", "Jeffrey Chalovich", "Sure. So I can't really speak to what the independents and others will do. I can speak to \u2013 we have a very rigorous process of how we manage our business and how we increase prices, track that and implement that. And whether it's during at time we've announced with our customers an increase or just normal course of business, we look to drive margins through other areas of our business. And that's through board rate optimizations. That's through efficiency gains. And so that's something we do as a matter of course with our customers. And we add value to them and help them drive total cost of use out of the system and improve our margins across our system.", "Chip Dillon", "I see. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman of Roe Equity Research. You may now ask your question.", "Gail Glazerman", "Hi. Good morning. I want to touch on containerboard inventories. Your 143,000 drop was quite significant relative to the industry decline of 272,000. And I know going all the way back to your Investor Meeting in 2013, you talked about carrying more inventory than four weeks. And, at one point, you had spotted a number that was much higher than the industry level. And I just want to know has that changed? And can you give any sense of where your current inventories are after that decline relevant to the 3.8 for the industry?", "James Porter", "This is Jim Porter. I'll take that one. You've heard correctly. We've put a lot of energy over the last two years investing in our supply chain processes and people to drive better systems and capability to match our customer requirements. That's the only reason we have inventories to ensure we've got the right products available on time for all of our channels. And so, you saw us early in our journey increasing inventories, but you've now seen them steadily decline. And I believe that's really the success of the implementations that we've had within our systems.", "Our system currently is in balance. It was somewhat dinned by the Hurricane Matthew. So, what we \u2013 frankly, a little below where we should be at this point in time. And then, you will also see us needing to increase inventories slightly as we focus on next quarter's maintenance downtime. But we manage inventories at a very granular level and the trend line downward, I think, is a result of those initiatives.", "Gail Glazerman", "Okay. That's great. Just one last question. Of the cost that you've estimated for the storm, how confident are you in that? Is everything kind of back up and running or are there any kind of risks in terms of operation, logistic, fiber supply beyond obviously the comments on inventories?", "Ward Dickson", "Yes. So we \u2013 Gail, this is Ward. We tried to capture all of those factors when we gave you the range of the estimate. I would say 50% of that cost that we identified was related to the lost production and 50% of it was actually related to the additional maintenance repair and some scrappage cost that we had in the quarter.", "Gail Glazerman", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. And our next question comes from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America. You may now ask your question.", "George Staphos", "Hi, guys. Thanks for the follow-up. Two questions, one kind of bigger picture and the other one more modeling related. On the latter, can you give us an update on what your thoughts for interest expense might be next year both cash and book, if there's any differences?", "And then we just came back from a conference where there was a lot of discussion on light-weight, high-performance grades and containerboard. Can you remind us what your position is on that and how SP Fiber helps you there and, ultimately, over time, what percentage of the market you think that might be able to represent? Thanks, guys. Good luck in the quarter.", "Ward Dickson", "George, this is Ward. I'll give you the answer to the interest question.", "George Staphos", "Yes.", "Ward Dickson", "I would model about $225 million of net interest. That's the interest expense less the interest income and book and cash are virtually the same.", "George Staphos", "Thanks Ward.", "Ward Dickson", "Yes.", "James Porter", "So, on the question of light-weight \u2013 this is Jim Porter.", "George Staphos", "Hey, Jim.", "James Porter", "Good morning. I think we've all seen a trend of lighter basis weights over the last several decades. Largely, though, in the U.S. market, those have been in, I would say, the middle weight grades transitioning from 69 and 42 down into the 33s and 35s. When we speak about light weight of sub-26 pound that really has been largely unchanged. It was 5% to 6% 30 years ago. And, frankly, today, it's about the same.", "Now, with that said, the Dublin mill has added some significant flexibility for us as we're able to go down really into the micro basis weights of 70 GSM or 14 pound board that we do have applications for. Our Corrugated business, some of the specialty food products grades, we now have the ability to integrate that with our own paper supply. So, we're quite excited about the future of that particular segment of the market.", "George Staphos", "So, Jim, implied in your answers is just you've got the capability but the fact that it's not really changed all that much tells you that the demand thus far domestically is \u2013 it's growing but not significantly. So would that be fair?", "James Porter", "I think that's exactly right.", "George Staphos", "All right. Thank you. I'll turn it over.", "Operator", "And, at this time, there are no questions. I'll turn it back to you, speakers.", "Steven Voorhees", "Okay. Matt?", "Matthew Tractenberg", "Thank you, Dexter. Thank you to our audience for your time this morning. We're proud of our progress. We appreciate your interest in WestRock. If you have questions following the call, the IR team is happy to help you. You could find our contact on today's earnings release.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the WestRock Company special announcements and second quarter fiscal year 2017 results call.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Matt Tractenberg, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Matt Tractenberg", "Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning for the call. We've issued a press release this morning and posted the accompany slide presentation to the Investor Relations section of our website. They can be accessed at ir.westrock.com or via a link on the right side of the application you are using to view this webcast.", "With me on today's call are WestRock's Chief Executive Officer, Steve Voorhees; Ward Dickson, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Porter, President of Business Development in Latin America; Jeff Chalovich, President of Corrugated Packaging; and Bob Feeser, President of our Consumer Packaging segment. Following our prepared comments, we will open up the call for a question-and-answer period.", "Before we begin, I would like to point out that during to the course of today's call we will make forward-looking statements involving our finance, expectations, estimates and believes related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we discuss during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the SEC, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 and our 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.", "Additionally, we will be referencing non-GAAP financial measures during the call today. We've provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the Appendix of the slide presentation. The slide presentation is available on our website.", "So with that said, I'll turn it over to you. Steve?", "Steven Voorhees", "Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. WestRock had a very good quarter. We generated $0.54 of adjusted earnings per share. We executed well. We delivered year-over-year productivity improvements of $103 million. Our productivity improvements were a highlight of the quarter and were the primary contributor helping us mostly offset the exceptional increase we experienced in input cost. While these higher input cost may persist favorable market trends and the relentless execution of our strategy by the WestRock team will drive improved results and increased value for our customers and stockholders' over the short and long-term.", "For a comprehensive portfolio of paper and packaging solutions is helping our customers meet their goals from quality paperboard to innovative and functional design to consumer packaging to corrugated packaging to displays. WestRock provides the full range of solutions to our customers. We are successful integrating our products and services to deliver value to our customers. Here are some examples of how we're doing this. We've already closed on more than $150 million an incremental annual sales from the breadth of our portfolio.", "Examples of these incremental sales include customers who already buy corrugated packaging from us and have decided to use WestRock to manufacture their folding cartons. This combination provides the opportunity for WestRock to work with these customers to reduce their total cost by optimizing the total fiber required to package and deliver their products.", "We have folding carton customers who have decided to use WestRock to design, manufacture and assemble displays and in the process this combination provides the opportunity for us to help integrate the best aspects of both products to help grow our customer's sales. Craft breweries are another excellent example. WestRock can provide craft brew customers with the beverage carrier, the corrugated box and the machinery to assemble the packaging, reducing their cost, supporting their growth, and reducing their supply chain risk as compared to relying on multiple suppliers.", "We are extending our solid track record of execution. At the end of the March quarter, we achieve an annual run rate of $675 million in synergies and performance improvements were two-thirds of the way to $1 billion goal. Since the completion of the merger, we've seen $632 million flow through our income statement.", "We have line of sight to achieve the $1 billion productivity goal by the end of the June quarter of 2018. This is one quarter sooner them initially planned and highlights the strong performance culture we are building at WestRock. We continue to execute our disciplined capital allocation strategy. We bought back $25 million of stock during the quarter.", "Since the merger, we've purchased 15.3 million shares at an average price of $49 per share. In total, we've returned $1.4 billion to stockholders since the merger through dividends and share repurchases. Since forming WestRock, we focused our portfolio on our core paper and packaging business. We excited the specialty chemicals business with the spin of Ingevity. We completed the sale with the Home, Health & Beauty business and monetized a significant portion of our land and development assets.", "Over the same time, we've improved our portfolio. We acquired SP Fiber and we acquired Cenveo Packaging. We further developed our position in Mexico with our joint venture with Grupo Gondi, and this quarter we acquired Star Pizza which has expanded our presence in the growing market for custom short-run pizza boxes.", "The announced acquisition of Multi Packaging Solutions will expand our presence in healthcare and high-end customer markets. The shareholders in Multi Packaging Solutions overwhelmingly approve the transaction and have both held earlier this month and we are progressing well in our integration planning. We anticipate that we will close this transaction in the June quarter. We are excited about the opportunities we are seeing to add new capabilities for short-run and premium products and services to our platform and to integrate in even broader portfolio of solutions across our exciting business.", "The work we've done today is confirming MPS was outstanding strategic fit in the WestRock portfolio. After we complete the Multi Packaging Solutions acquisition, our portfolio will be balanced between consumer and corrugated packaging. This balance will provide WestRock the access and the opportunity to participate in a wide range of end markets and the ability to partner with customers across our entire portfolio.", "More than 80% of our business will be in North America. About $800 million of our sales will be to Central and South American markets. Another $1.2 billion will be in the European markets and yet another $0.5 billion will be to the Asia Pacific markets. The scale in foreign markets has and will provide us additional opportunities to create efficient supply chains to support our customers' growth across these markets.", "Now, let's turn to the details of our second quarter performance. Sales for the quarter were $3.7 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $547 million for consolidated margin of 15%. Total commodity inflation was $125 million headwind year-over-year. This was the result of significant increases across most of our input costs including a $75 million or $66 per ton increase in the cost of recovered fiber and a $23 million or $1.23 per MMBtu increased in the cost of natural gas.", "On a percentage basis, our cost of recovered fiber increased by 81% and the cost of natural gas increased by 59%. The corrugated packaging team executed well in the quarter and included the benefits of the $40 per ton price increase published in October as well as increased volumes and productivity gains. These benefits were offset by the previous year's PPW published price reductions and significant inflation. North American corrugated second shipments were up 76,000 tons a total of 3.7% compared to the same quarter of last year.", "Box shipments per day increased 1.1% as compared to last year with strength in consumer, eCommerce, and select food markets. The corrugated segment continues to focus on our differentiated strategy and growth in the segments and markets where we can best position ourselves to drive value for our customers and for WestRock. Over the coming months, we will be integrating the 25,000 annual tons containerboard converted by Star Pizza.", "Last fall's $40 per ton domestic containerboard price increase that we communicated to our customers has been fully implemented, so we are now at a full run rate. Currently, we are in the process of implementing our $50 per ton domestic price increase that we announced to our customers in March and was recognized in Pulp & Paper Week this past Friday night.", "Healthy demand in our export markets continues in part driven by the strong South American growing season both sequentially and year-over-year. Export pricing in March was up significantly from our low point of last year with increases in effect in all of the markets. We fulfilled all backlog export orders from the fall in early winter. Remember, that Hurricane Matthew disrupted our ability to fulfill export demand in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 effectively pushing that volume into the March quarter.", "We are currently shipping at a more nominal run rate of approximately 300,000 tons per quarter. North American adjusted EBITDA margins were 15.9%. Commodity inflation was $91 million. We achieved productivity improvements of $36 million as compared to the year-ago period.", "This prevalence is the direct result of our entire organizations focused on performance excellence that is supported by our continuing capital investments to improve our integrated corrugated packaging system. We managed our inventory as well with inventories declining by 148,000 tons from last year. We took 78,000 tons of maintenance downtime in the quarter in line with our expectations and we took no containerboard economic downtime.", "Our joint venture with Grupo Gondi is progressing very well. Gondi reported sales of $192 million and EBITDA margins in excess of 20%. The Mexican packaging markets remain attractive and the business is very well positioned. In fact, additional investments are in process that will enable Gondi to continue to meet the needs of its customers well into the future.", "Our Brazil team continued to perform well with 16.5% total growth in box shipments, up more than triple that of the industry. We have an outstanding business and team in Brazil and see the potential to make incremental investments in this area that can provide attractive growth in returns.", "During the quarter, we recorded $2.8 million of legal reserves, which unfavorably impacted our EBITDA margins at 270 basis points. Our corrugated customers are seeking to meet their growing demand for greater performance and more high-end packaging that appeals to today's consumers.", "We're partnering with our customers to innovate in the space, create packaging solutions that protect our products and enhanced our brands. We have and will continue to invest in our corrugated platform to meet our customers changing needs and improve our cost position. This work will enable us to generate strong cash flows and improve our margins in our corrugated segment.", "The Consumer Packaging team operated extremely well and generated excellent results. Adjusted EBITDA was $235 million or 15.1% of revenue, an increase of 100 basis points year-over-year. Shipments of paperboard and converted products increased 0.9%, driven by growth in foodservice, liquid packaging and folding carton. This was offset by weaker beverage volume.", "Revenue declined year-over-year as a result of lower pulp volume and last year's published PPW price reductions. We expect this pricing trend to slow and then reverse for us as we implement price increases across every grade.", "Our SBS backlogs improved in the quarter and are currently a healthy six weeks, driven by demand and foodservice and liquid packaging. CNK backlogs also improved in the quarter and are now at six weeks. CRB backlogs are now at two weeks, which is our normal operating level.", "Consumer Packaging generated outstanding productivity, $72 million in the March quarter. We operated extremely well by implementing a broad range of improvement projects across the segment, which include ongoing converting footprint optimization, sourcing and capital investments.", "We continue to benefit from the integration of the volume we brought into the system from the acquisition of the Carolina product line, the Cenveo Packaging acquisition and internalization of the volume from the merger. The merger has also provided WestRock the opportunity to market our innovative paperboard products through our existing folding carton network. These innovative products include a paperboard called EnShield.", "EnShield has been designed for applications, such as frozen food and foodservice where the customer needs an excellent grease barrier without the use of poly coatings. By eliminating the use of poly coatings the package is fully recyclable, which enables our customers to meet their sustainability objectives. Several of our customers are successfully using this product and we are growing interest in EnShield throughout our customer base.", "Ward, I'll turn it over to you.", "Ward Dickson", "Thank you, Steve. Our strategy to monetize the land portfolio is proceeding well and as planned. I'm very pleased by our most recent sale of large portions of Nexton, the largest project in the portfolio. The sales resulted in more than $75 million in after-tax cash flow for WestRock, which drove segment income of $18 million for the quarter, due to our accelerated monetization strategy in accordance with GAAP, we are required to mark down the book value on any projects for the expected sales proceeds are less than book value. Therefore we wrote down the book value on a few projects by $42.7 million, before our joint venture partner share of $6.4 million.", "In addition because of the real estate assets now meat the gap held for sale criteria. We have reclassified the caring values to current assets on our March 31 balance sheet. We expect the other properties to have sales proceeds in excess of book value and continue to believe we will achieve the previously mentioned range of $275 million to $300 million and net after tax proceeds. We continue to expect cash flow for fiscal 2017 to be between $150 million and $175 million from our land and development monetization efforts.", "We delivered $103 million in productivity and synergy improvements in the quarter and now expect to exceed an $800 million run rate by the end of the fiscal year. We believe that the $1 billion target will be reached by the end of the June quarter of fiscal 2018 which Steve mentioned earlier. We also continue to execute well on our disciplined capital allocation strategy.", "During the quarter we returned more than $125 million to our stockholders through both dividends and our share repurchase program. As mentioned on our previous earnings call we expect pro-forma leverage hosting Multi Packaging Solutions transaction and including synergies to be slightly above 2.5 times. We have strong opportunities to invest in our business and in M&A. We expect to allocate more capital into these growth and margin improvement opportunities then to share repurchases over the near-term.", "We expect to achieve our current target of $1.2 billion of adjusted free cash flow in fiscal 2017. There been numerous changes in the external environment since we provided the guidance at the beginning of the year. We've had significant increases in inflation particularly recycled fiber, but we are also operating in a more favorable pricing environment and generating more productivity.", "In addition our land sales acceleration efforts are contributing more cash flow this year. Maintaining the $1.2 billion guidance in adjusted free cash flow is a testament to the strength of our business model, as well as our ability to executed stay on plan. For the third quarter we expect sequential adjusted earnings per share - per diluted share higher than the $0.54 achieved in the second quarter.", "For purposes of modeling we provided the key sequential drivers that will impact the quarter. First, we will benefit in the range of $50 million to $70 million of EBITDA from price seasonally higher volumes, favorable mix, and productivity. Second, inflationary pressures from recycled fiber impacted a significantly more than we expected in the March quarter. While prices have moderated recently they remain elevated both on a year-over-year and sequential basis.", "Based on our regional consumption mix a recycled fiber index cost was $118 per ton in January, $140 per ton in February, $181 per ton in March for a quarterly average of $146 per ton. Our price per ton declined in April to $168. We expect that recycled fiber costs will moderate slightly from here, but anticipate the average price in the June quarter to be higher than the March quarter.", "Third, we've completed the sale of our Home Health & Beauty business in early April and as a result we will forgo approximately $27 million of EBITDA in the June quarter. We do not anticipate meaningful EBITDA contribution from our land and development segment in the third quarter.", "Please note that our guidance does not include any potential contributions or earnings or adjusted free cash flow from the Multi Packaging Solutions acquisition since the closing date is uncertain.", "And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve.", "Steven Voorhees", "Thanks Ward. We've made substantial progress over the past two years focusing our portfolio and growing a leader in paper and packaging. We are well positioned to improve our margins, grow our cash and help our customers to achieve their goals for our comprehensive portfolio the paper and packaging solutions combined with our strong execution. We will use our consistent and growing cash flow to reimbursement our business and make acquisitions that improve our business.", "We expect to return capital to stockholders by increasing our dividend over time and repurchasing shares. I believe this is a formula that will provide significant opportunities for WestRock employees, customers and investors over the short-term and long-term.", "That concludes my prepared remarks. Matt, we are ready for questions.", "Matt Tractenberg", "Thank you, Steve. As a reminder to our audience, please limit your questions to one, with a follow-up if needed. We will get to as many as time allows. Chris, can we take our first question, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Brian Maguire", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "Steven Voorhees", "Good morning.", "Brian Maguire", "Steve, we've seen really strong box shipment volume so far in the last six months, it seems like the industry has maybe entered into a new period of little bit faster growth than we've been at over the last couple years. Just wondering if you have any views on what's really been driving that, I think people have kind of speculated eCommerce, but just wondering if there are some other factors like a stronger industrial economy maybe a little bit better fruit and vegetable demand expected this summer just as you kind of talk to your customers, just wondered what you're seeing out there and how sustainable you think these trends really are?", "Steven Voorhees", "Brian I appreciate the question. Jeff Chalovich is close to that, so I'm going to let Jeff respond.", "Jeff Chalovich", "Good morning, Brian. I think some of the things you outlined in the markets to include eCommerce, some of the fresh and convenient trends in the marketplace we're helping. We have seen in our business an uptick in industrial in the last couple years, actually it's come back some back on onshore has helped our business, so there is a bit more of industrial coming back and then the consumer non-durables although it's straight a little bit from it, the eCommerce piece I believe is helping that and driving some of the growth that you are seeing in the market.", "Brian Maguire", "Okay, great. And with that as a backdrop just wondering how the rollout of the box price increases going, I recognized you got the $50 from receipt and a lot of the contracts are linked to that, but just as you're having conversations with folks and if there's any volume not linked to that, how is the box price increase being received?", "Ward Dickson", "The reception is the same as most of the increases I've experienced. We expect the implementation of the $50 that we've announced to flow through the same way the $40, so we'll have some benefit in this quarter. And then by September, we should be at a full run rate on the $50.", "Brian Maguire", "Okay, great. Just one last one if I would, just on the outlook for the third quarter, just wanted to be clear on the guidance there the $0.54 based in this quarter that excluded about $0.04 of land sales and so as we're thinking about bridging from the $0.54 to whatever it is in 3Q, we don't need to deduct anything for land sales there right?", "Ward Dickson", "That's correct. The contribution land for the contribution of EBITDA and free cash flow is included, but it's excluded from EPS.", "Brian Maguire", "Got it. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "George Staphos", "Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. My two questions are just further delving into trends you are seeing in the fiscal third quarter so far. Number one, can you comment at all Jeff or team in terms of what trends you're seeing early in the quarter, markets that maybe are developing in line are better than expected perhaps those it might not be.", "And then the second related question and recognizing this is a little bit like asking Ms. Lincoln how the play was. If you exclude the effect of inflation which has been significantly more than we are you would have expected several months ago and you looked at what your expectations were for this portion of the year. How are you trending? How are you mapping against that again in terms of the fiscal third quarter whether it would be volume, clearly pricing is better, anything you care to share there? Thank you, guys.", "Steven Voorhees", "George, I'm going to let Jeff handle the first question and let Ward handle the second part of the question.", "Jeff Chalovich", "Hi, George.", "George Staphos", "Hey, Jeff. Good morning.", "Jeff Chalovich", "Good morning. So far April is shaping up to be strong, there is two less shipping days, but on a per day basis we are up 4.2% through the first half of the month. The segments that we are seeing, we are seeing our agriculture in Northern California come back, the weather start to dry up.", "That's been an outage for the last couple months, but we're seeing that come back as weather dries and I think overall that segment will be good long-term because they have water now. eCommerce continues to be strong for us and then some of our consumer markets and some of the food, our markets are still strong for us. I don't really see any trending office unexpected, but those markets particularly stick out as strong.", "Ward Dickson", "George, this is Ward. First our capital Q2 and how we performed relative to our expectations in the quarter. Clearly as we walked into the quarter, we did not anticipate the pace of the increase in OCC in the quarter. So inflation was probably $25 million higher than what the expectation was as we enter the quarter.", "But that was offset by the stronger corrugated volumes that we had, better pricing in mix across both businesses and our mill operations particularly in consumer that you saw from the productivity that we generate in the quarter. They performed extremely well, so our productivity was at a pace that was higher than we expected. And then clearly we also had an additional month of HH&B in the quarter as compared to our expectations at the beginning of the quarter.", "Now as I go on to Q3 and Q4, and look at the full fiscal year, the ability for us to maintain the full-year free cash flow guidance. I think shouldn't be lost given the inflationary environment that we're in. So we guided input cost inflation for the full-year at the beginning of the year to approach $200 million.", "If you look at the pace of where we are through the first half and then compare that for the full-year that input cost inflation can be close to $350 million for the full-year and what we've been able to do is offset that with more favorable pricing, stronger volumes, stronger productivity and the accelerated monetization efforts that we have in land and development.", "George Staphos", "Okay. Listen, I have exceeded my allotted question, I just want to say the performance in consumer productivity was very good. Congratulations of that. Thanks, I'll turn it over.", "Steven Voorhees", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chris Manuel of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.", "Chris Manuel", "Good morning, gentlemen. Congratulations on a very strong quarter. Just two quick questions, first, there was quite a bit of premium attached OCC, your different elements of that nature. Could you give us a sense maybe of how your recycle business did? Where you how planning of those components or not? And then my follow-up question as do some of the boxboard basis.", "Steven Voorhees", "Our recycling business that the - I guess the primary goal to recycling business is to make sure we have high quality fiber to - for a mills. We do operate a couple dozen plants. We do have a very well developed brokerage operation and they operated extremely successful and they were able to fiber mills and I think to - they also market waste from our converting operations. So they just had a - I think they performed up standard way well during the quarter.", "Chris Manuel", "Okay, then my second question had to do with some of the various possible grades; it looks like on the longer cycle grade, there was some price published over the weekend as well. What's your outlook for getting some more there? Are you done with your efforts? Is it just more of a staggered thing going through and then can you talk a little bit about the recycle grade as well or your outlook for recovering some of the higher deposit costs?", "Robert Feeser", "Hi, Chris, this is Bob Feeser. I'll just make a couple of comments on that so. As you know we have made an announcement about an SBS and a CUK increase and we're in the market working with our customers to move our prices up and we fully anticipate that we will get those price increases through and then as you also know we also announced a second CRB increase, which we are in the market as well. We have fully reflected in our forecast the CRB that increase that was reflected in pulp and paper week.", "Chris Manuel", "Thank you, guys.", "Steven Voorhees", "Thanks, Chris.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Debbie Jones", "Hi, good morning.", "Steven Voorhees", "Good morning, Debbie.", "Debbie Jones", "I was wondering if you could talk a little about the comments you made the strategy to potentially grow in Brazil where are the opportunities that you are seeing is it mostly on the converting side where I imagine you would get significant synergies or are you open to mill systems as well and kind of a sense of how urgent this is for you?", "Steven Voorhees", "Okay. Let me Jim Porter leads our Brazil operations now, so now like Jim respond to that question.", "James Porter", "Good morning, Debbie. First of all we really love our Brazil business the management team in that region are doing an outstanding job and continuing to execute a very strong manner. What we have some of the best timberland on the planet very new virgin containerboard machine and the trace box mill and a nice packaging system that's focused on innovative solutions. So they're performing very well. So our macro view of that business is to invest in it and we would see it being complimentary to expand our packaging and our know system capability. So we are not here was specificity but we are engaged in developing projects in that region.", "Debbie Jones", "Can you give us a sense of that the opportunity in the region for M&A, is there a pipeline?", "James Porter", "We really don't speak on our pipeline, but we are considering investments in our existing businesses our primary focus, but we are open to M&A that could merge with that business but it's not our primary focus.", "Debbie Jones", "Okay thanks. And then just my follow-up question, just can echoing whatever and that the consumer business is quite strong. I am assuming that that productivity performance is what's driving the comments around exceeding these 100 million by year-end? Could you just begin to kind of what went better than expected this quarter and what's driving the increased in the $800 million targets?", "Robert Feeser", "Debbie, this is Bob Feeser. We delivered strong productivity with buy and large so in line with our expectations. The mills ran extremely well for the quarter and we're continuing to see really strong yield from our base productivity program, which is many hundreds of projects across the system. We're continuing to capitalize on merger benefits and we'll be lapping those benefits in the coming quarters and I would mention that our beverage and displace business. We saw very strong productivity in those businesses with the fixed cost actions that we've taken as well as converting footprint optimization projects.", "Ward Dickson", "Debbie, this is Ward. I would just reiterate our goal along has been to when asked if we would raise the $1 billion productivity target it was to achieve the productivity target faster. So although the performance is very strong in the consumer business and Bob is talking about many of the merger related benefits of the internalization of the 250,000 tons that we talked about in the past we've also are making improvements also in our corrugated business and as well as the corporate functions as well that had merger related synergies So it's across the whole company that gives us the confidence that we're going to be able to exceed the $800 million run rate exiting the year and then actually pull in the full - the timing of the $4 billion goal by a quarter.", "Debbie Jones", "Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. I turn it over.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub of Buckingham Research. Your line is open.", "Mark Weintraub", "Just one clarification first half. It also in the bridge from the current quarter to the coming quarter, you noted that the negative $27 million from the sale of Home Health & Beauty. I think you maybe had backed that about $10 million or so from the EPS result pretax. So in thinking bridge should be thinking more like a minus 17 as we do an EBITDA bridge from this quarter to the current quarter?", "Steven Voorhees", "What we showed you was the EBITDA that remember when we recorded the held for sale we did not depreciate. We had lower depreciation in the quarter is normally the D&A in that business was about $3 to $3.5 million a month. So there was also the benefit in the in Q2 which we backed out of adjusted EPS held for sale impact on the lower D&A. So the sequential improvement from an EPS point of view would have reflected not only that we don't have the EBITDA contribution, but then you don't have that benefit that you have from the lower D&A. EPS is the net of the two.", "Mark Weintraub", "Got it. And you really did do phenomenally well in the consumer packaging relative to what I've been anticipating and productivity was a big part of it. Also that the pricing and mix held up much better than what I had anticipated given what we've seen in paper week during the prior year. Is that a function just of timing of when things roll through or have we really seen the majority of the negative downward drift and in fact we start to begin to see some of the positive price action begin to run through the P&L, how should we think about that?", "Robert Feeser", "Yes. Mark, this is Feeser again. So, yes we did see some positive mix underlying the business and really driven by some positive trends that we're seeing in liquid packaging and food service as well as growth in the healthcare and beauty markets as well. So that's positive mix, but we still have more of the announced price for the reflected PPW price to flow through in the next quarter before we start to see the trend back up with the price announcements that we've made.", "Mark Weintraub", "Okay, great. And then lastly on MPS, can you update us on expectation of closing for the transaction?", "Ward Dickson", "We still need a couple of regulatory approvals. We anticipate getting those over the next couple months, so we anticipate closing during this quarter.", "Mark Weintraub", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Wilde of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Mark Wilde", "Good morning, Steve. Good morning, Ward.", "Steven Voorhees", "Good morning, Mark.", "Mark Wilde", "I wondered if we could kind of coming back to consumer packaging in these productivity gains, is it possible that you can just help us parse out the key elements with a little more detail?", "Steven Voorhees", "Sure. Again the biggest individual driver that contributes to the acceleration of productivity on a year-over-year basis has been the internalization efforts that we've had since the merger. As we move into the second half of this fiscal year as Bob said, we are lapping those benefits. So it's the integration of the Carolina tons, the integration of the Legacy RockTenn folding carton tons, the integration of the Cenveo tons. Those are large contributors to the benefits.", "We've had procurement savings like we do across the whole system. And we also have footprint actions that we have been talking about both in our beverage business. We've actually took some footprint actions in our displays business as well, so it's a combination of all of those. I think on a year-over-year basis, as we look at this fiscal year, I would anticipate that this quarter would be the peak quarter in terms of productivity on a year-over-year basis because we do start to lap the benefits of the internalization efforts that really hit full speed as we went into the second half of fiscal 2016.", "Mark Wilde", "Okay. On those internalization, I mean some of that we understand is kind of bleach board that you are selling on the outside going into cartons, but is some of it also perhaps where you'd maybe been running some rolled pulp at the bleach board mills, and so you're actually not running rolled pulp, you are back running bleach board and you're able to internalize it?", "Robert Feeser", "Yes. Mark, this is Bob Feeser. That's exactly it. As we manage our system, the big opportunity from the integration of those tons was to upgrade the mix and eliminate the production of pulp in the system and integrate these tons, so that's exactly it.", "Mark Wilde", "Okay. And Bob just for my kind of closing, can you just do the same thing with box board in the cartons that we've talked about with kind of containerboard in the boxes in terms of timing, because I recall it back in the MeadWestvaco days moving those bleach board hikes through with some of the customers in tobacco or whatever, usually took quite a while. And I think there's some of the same that occurs in the CNK business?", "Robert Feeser", "Yes, those dynamics are similar I would say in the boxboard markets compared to containerboard that there is certainly a lag and we've typically would peg that it roughly about nine months from the time of a board increase through passthrough on boxes.", "Mark Wilde", "Okay, that's helpful. Good luck in the quarter.", "Steven Voorhees", "Thanks Mark.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Adam Josephson of KeyBanc. Your line is open.", "Adam Josephson", "Thanks, good morning everyone.", "Steven Voorhees", "Good morning, Adam.", "Adam Josephson", "Steve, just one question on eCommerce and one on OCC, I don't know how to direct this to Jeff or Steve. You mentioned a positive impact on your box demand in the quarter and continuing in April, I don't think that it's surprise anyone, can you talk about also the impact on availability and price of recycle fiber as a result of the growth in eCommerce and as well as whatever price mix impact this eCommerce growth is having on your business?", "Steven Voorhees", "Sure, I'm going to let Jeff to handle that.", "Jeff Chalovich", "Good morning, Adam.", "Adam Josephson", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeff Chalovich", "On the recycle piece, there is some uptick of OCC or corrugated going to our single stream recycling centers. So we operate those centers and it's a few percentage points. So it has some effect, but I would say it's not a driving effect at this point in time on driving OCC prices as eCommerce becomes bigger, it may have a bigger effect right now it's very minimal.", "The mix of that business varies. If you look at our system some of the investments in EVOLs, die cutters. The things we've done in the system, we're setting up our systems to run the complete mix of the eCommerce space. So you have small RSCs wraps, die cut wraps that we're putting machines and to be able to handle those mailers, [T-folders,] we're equipped very well across our system with scale to address the complete mix of the eCommerce space.", "We're also seeing more graphics, which we can use the photos of products. So websites are a little laminate, manufacturer in our merchandise displays or footprint we're able to address that space across our entire enterprise. I won't speak to the margins, but the mix I think we're well positioned to address.", "Adam Josephson", "Thanks, Jeff. And Ward, just want to know OCC. I know you mentioned you expect slightly lower OCC cost sequentially. Can you help us with what decline you're expecting in May whether it's $15 a ton or otherwise and related what if any impact you think decline in OCC in May would have on your ability to raise box prices and CRB prices? Thank you very much.", "Ward Dickson", "So the guidance that we gave on inflation is largely the range is due to OCC. So what I would say is that our expected average for the quarter is up between $10 and $15 a ton. So that would imply some slight moderation from the April level and then we just really carried out through the end of the fiscal year without any real sequential decline from Q3 to Q4.", "We believe that the environment to execute that containerboard price increase is strong and in fact we've reflected it in our free cash flow guidance and underlying demand operating rates. Inventory levels support the implementation of the price increase both - in all three of our channels because we are also implementing price increases into the export channel as well. And so we feel good about the outlook and we've reflected that in our free cash flow guidance for the full-year.", "Adam Josephson", "Thanks a lot Ward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng of Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Philip Ng", "Hey, guys. Question for Ward. In your 3Q guidance, do you have any incremental pricing benefit from the April increase or exports flowing through? Reason why I ask you that I would have thought the open market tons from April increase would have provided a larger list, but can you remind us the cadence on how the timing works to PPW reflected in April? Do you start seeing the open market increase in May? Just some color around that.", "Ward Dickson", "Okay. So the prices mix volume and productivity where we've identified at $50 million to $70 million sequential improvement. The biggest individual driver of that is price.", "Philip Ng", "Okay.", "Ward Dickson", "We will get sequential price increases because of the export price increases that we announced recently and are implementing. We will start to get the initial benefits in our domestic containerboard channel and in boxes well and as Jeff said the implementation will be very consistent with the implementation of the $40 per ton increase and by the time we exit the fourth fiscal quarter we anticipate that we will be would be a full run rate.", "Philip Ng", "Okay. That's helpful. And then one more question for you Ward. From a cash flow standpoint I know you excluded MPS [you have encoded]. Can you provide some color on contribution you think it's going to have for this year and in land sales you guys are able to monetize it well quicker this year so that the big left on cash flow for 2017 but how should we think about the lumpy for 2018?", "Ward Dickson", "Let me start with the second question. So I will give a buildup of how we get to the $300 million of the land accelerated monetization efforts. We started the clock on that in Q4 of FY2016 and we had about $10 million that was contributed. If we achieve the $175 that means that we will have about between $100 and $150 million to go in fiscal 2018 and that's our current plan. Now I forgot you gave me two questions I forgot the second question?", "Philip Ng", "The MPS do you say know the deal has been closed but any color on the contribution on cash flow but actually the share?", "Steven Voorhees", "What I would look at is I would just refer you to their historical public filings and look at their unleveled free cash flow generation. We will have more details when we actually closed the transaction and then have a forecast of how it's embedded and along with our integration plans, but at this point I would point you to their historical public filings.", "Philip Ng", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chip Dillon of Vertical. Your line is open.", "Chip Dillon", "Yes, good morning.", "Steven Voorhees", "Good morning, Chip.", "Chip Dillon", "First question have to do just making sure we understand the tax rate in the last quarter. It depends on I guess the non-controlling interest bill. It looks like it was pretty high on operations like 38% but in Ward if you could clarify that. And then secondly, I'm not sure if you all actually had any land sales cash in 2016 so is that mean you have about $125 million left in 2018 if you hit the $150 to $175 target?", "Ward Dickson", "So Chip I just answered your second question and the last question. We did $10 million in Q4 FY2016 so of land sales. So it's approximately $115 million that would be required next year to get to the high end of the range. If I would point you on the adjusted - the tax rate for adjusted EPS was just over 34% current quarter. The best thing for you to do is to go to the press release the last page in the press release have all the adjustments and the associated tax related to those adjustments and then you can bridge back to the 34%.", "Chip Dillon", "Yes, well, I just it wasn't clear how the non-controlling 6.4% was treated but I see what you're doing here? So is that makes sense.", "Ward Dickson", "Yes, and so our guidance going forward is still 34%, our cash tax rate for the full-year will approach 38%.", "Chip Dillon", "And then just real quickly more for Steve, as you think about the MeadWestvaco acquisition? Have you found any ways to benefit cross segments from that and what I mean particular what OCC spiking like it has - has it and thinking about the first quarter being seasonally slow for CNK? Is there any way you can sort of bridge that in any way whereby you know maybe you actually are better off as a company slowing back you know recycle mills and maybe making a little bit of just linerboard at March.", "Robert Feeser", "Yes, Chip this is Bob Feeser. We are actually integrating if you will March as part of the overall containerboard system and where it makes sense in those offered periods to actually run a little bit of craft linear to do exactly what you indicated. So that's actually a nice positive that we see as part of the overall merger.", "Chip Dillon", "Understood thank you.", "Steven Voorhees", "Chip, I just go on from there, when we - the idea of the merger was to build the paper and packaging leader and consumer and corrugated packaging. I go back and look at what we saw it periodically in the time we announce merger and we're just spot on what we intended to do. So we've got leadership positions in the businesses we operate.", "We've integrated to outstanding organizations. We're focused on customers who are larger more balanced in our Company. And we have I think a terrific slate of investment opportunities both internally and potentially be acquisition. But just kind of put us in a great position going forward. I just want to add that to your question, since you brought up the merger.", "Chip Dillon", "Well, I'm not sure I would have ever anticipated when I just asked, but it certainly is clear that's one big positive. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steve Chercover of Davidson. Your line is open.", "Steve Chercover", "Thanks. Good morning everyone. First of all, just on Star Pizza was that about a $35 million acquisition and what multiple was paid please?", "Steven Voorhees", "We haven't put out this specific numbers on that. I think the purchase price here in the zone of what it was and I think we haven't announced a multiple, but it's a very attractive multiple for us particularly when you put in the 20,000 tons of annual containerboard integration. We have as a result.", "Steve Chercover", "I recognize it small, but still nice to see it integrating. And then I want to get a bit more color on exports if you would. So you've got both a price increase and if I'm not mistaken just a diminishing discount, so can you give us a sense of what the mill nets or how they might be changing year-over-year?", "Steven Voorhees", "I'm sorry, what are changing? I didn't hear with you.", "Steve Chercover", "I guess I'm calling it mill nets because I think you've got both an explicit price hike, but also the discount in the export is getting smaller. So I'm wondering how much more you're actually capturing in the export market per ton?", "Ward Dickson", "Well, we've increased significantly from the low point exports and the markets are strong that we're serving. It's a good market for us and I'd say that from a low point we have significant increases that we're putting through right now.", "Steve Chercover", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari of Citigroup. Your line is open.", "Anthony Pettinari", "Hi, good morning.", "Steven Voorhees", "Good morning.", "Anthony Pettinari", "On the free cash flow guidance, I was wondering if it's possible that quantify the expected impact working capital, I think you said it was maybe a $70 million source of cash earlier in the year, has that changed?", "Ward Dickson", "Anthony, this is Ward. It has not changed materially.", "Anthony Pettinari", "Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then just going back to export containerboard, is it possible, but qualify the export price increases that you're currently implementing that maybe aren't looks like that and kind of the latest pulp and paper week? Are they kind of on the order of magnitude of $30 a ton, $50 a ton, any kind of color you can give us across the major market you ship to?", "Ward Dickson", "As I said Anthony, we are in the process of implementing. I think part of the drag was we had the 33,000 tons in the quarter that we moved over that sort of diminish the flow through some of the pricing. But we're in the midst right now of the increase and we are moving to significantly in those markets.", "Anthony Pettinari", "Okay, that's helpful.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Scott Gaffner of Barclays. Your line is open.", "Scott Gaffner", "Hi good morning.", "Steven Voorhees", "Good morning.", "Scott Gaffner", "Jeff, quick question on the volumes within the corrugated segment, you were up 1% this quarter and the industry up - was up about 2% and I think you were slightly below the industry in the prior quarter as well. But you mentioned maybe some end market exposure like Ag and maybe there's some geography there. Is there anything specific to point to as to the underperformance relative to the industry and maybe we start to recover that as we move into the back half of the year based on your exposure?", "Jeff Chalovich", "Hi, Scott. So I think there's a lot of dynamics that effect volume overall in the short-term. There has been some weather things there's lots of things that happen in the markets that affect short-term. Over time we were serving markets in segments and we believe we can add value to our customers and to our business in a differentiated strategy and I am fully expect that over the term - the long-term which we have shown over the long-term we can grow at the market and beyond.", "Scott Gaffner", "Okay and we see announced that they were putting on hold their recycled fiber recycled containerboard index. For a while, but they are also exploring a more objective calculation methodology for pricing on a go forward basis any initial thoughts on what that would do as far as volatility in pricing for containerboard?", "Robert Feeser", "I mean it's too early to tell I don't know enough about the performance space yet my position as we think the current index works well it's a good indication of movement and we prefer that we keep the same baseline that we have now, but I don't know enough to say what it will do in the future.", "Scott Gaffner", "Okay. But last one for Ward just on you mentioned the $70 million positive working capital, but you have $150 million of in additional raw materials headwind. So where is the from a working capital perspective where is the variance relative to that that gets you still that $70 million positive.", "Ward Dickson", "So that's a point over time - that's the inflation's over the course of the whole year and the working capital set up, a point in time at the end of the year what I will say is that we've done a good job of managing inventories and our procurement organizations soon a fantastic job of implementing our supply chain financing program and extending terms with our vendors.", "Scott Gaffner", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I return the call to our presenters.", "Matt Tractenberg", "Okay. Thank you, Chris, and thank you to our audience for joining today's call. As always reach out to us. If you have any questions, we're happy to help.

My name is Jack, and I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the WestRock Company Third Quarter FY '17 Results Call.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Matt Tractenberg, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Matt Tractenberg", "Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We issued a press release this morning and posted the accompanying slide presentation to the Investor Relations section of our Web site. They can be accessed at ir.westrock.com or via the link on the right side of the application you\u2019re using to view this webcast.", "With me on today\u2019s call are WestRock\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Steve Voorhees; Ward Dickson, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Porter, President of Business Development and Latin America; Jeff Chalovich, President of Corrugated Packaging; and Bob Feeser, President of our Consumer Packaging segment. Following our prepared comments, we will open the call up for a question-and-answer period.", "Before we begin, I\u2019d like to point out that during the course of today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we discuss during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the SEC, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, and our 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.", "Additionally, we will be referencing non-GAAP financial measures during today\u2019s call. We provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation. The slide presentation is available on our Web site.", "So with that said, I\u2019ll turn it over to you, Steve.", "Steven Voorhees", "Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. The WestRock team delivered outstanding results during the June quarter. We generated $0.74 in adjusted earnings per share and $94 million in year-over-year productivity improvements. These productivity improvements, along with improved pricing and channel mix, more than offset the extraordinarily high input cost that we\u2019ve had to absorb over the past year.", "Our comprehensive portfolio of paper and packaging solutions enables WestRock to deliver value to our customers. We deliver value to our customers by using our capabilities to develop solutions that help our customers grow their sales, lower their total costs, reduce their operating risk and achieve their sustainability goals. Our acquisitions enhance our product portfolio, improve our integration levels and expand our footprint. This enables us to better serve and deliver value to our customers.", "We\u2019ve made substantial progress toward our $1 billion productivity goal. We achieved an annual run rate of $760 million at the end of June, and we expect to reach the $1 billion goal by June of 2018. These achievements have been a direct result of our teammates executing our strategy throughout WestRock and implementing opportunities to do things better each and every day.", "We\u2019ve generated $950 million in adjusted free cash flow through June of this fiscal year, and we\u2019re on track to meet or exceed the $1.2 billion that we said we\u2019d generate this fiscal year. The reliability of our cash flow reflects the strength of our company and the strength of our business model.", "We\u2019ve taken steps to further transform our portfolio to a business fully focused on paper and packaging. These steps included the sale of our dispensing business, the sale of our interest in ArborGen and the accelerated sales of our land and development properties.", "We\u2019re strengthening and building our paper and packaging portfolio and have made a number of recent acquisitions. The largest of the acquisitions is Multi Packaging Solutions. MPS has substantially increased our participation in the higher growth healthcare and specialty packaging markets, has expanded our operating footprint in Europe and Asia.", "Since closing the transaction, we\u2019ve made significant progress integrating the organization and identifying footprint opportunities. And we\u2019re beginning to capture the benefits of paperboard integration. We\u2019ve transitioned eight folding carton plants serving primarily health and beauty markets to the MPS operations. This has enhanced our capabilities to serve specialty packaging customers with an expanded geographic footprint.", "We\u2019re optimizing the footprint of our combined system by evaluating opportunities to eliminate excess manufacturing capacity and increase utilization across the most efficient plants in our system. Last month, we announced the closure of a folding carton facility in Texas, and we\u2019re repurposing one of our Canadian facilities from a combined folding carton and label facility to one producing only labels.", "We\u2019ve initiated the supply of our paperboard to our MPS facilities and expect to achieve our target run rate of 100,000 tons per year of paperboard integration by the end of fiscal 2018. We\u2019ve moved quickly to achieve the synergies from the transaction and believe we\u2019ll capture more than half of our expected $85 million of synergies during fiscal 2018 and hit a full run rate by the end of fiscal 2019.", "MPS has been successful in standardizing their manufacturing processes across geographies. For example, MPS has been able to successfully provide cartons manufactured in North America, Europe and Asia to global customers interested in consistent, high-quality packaging around the world. This capability will be enhanced by the integrated supply of high-quality paperboard from WestRock\u2019s mills.", "Earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of Hannapak, an Australian converter with whom we\u2019ve had a long-term relationship as the converting partner for our beverage paperboard for our customers in Australia. The $60 million acquisition will integrate our converting and paperboard sales, and it\u2019s a natural extension for our consumer business in Australia. Hannapak will help improve our beverage business and will give us a platform for further growth in the food, food service, health and beauty markets with existing and new customers. The acquisition is immediately accretive on a cash flow and earnings basis.", "We completed two important corrugated acquisitions in June and July with U.S. Corrugated and Island Container. The addition of U.S. Corrugated has expanded our presence in geographies where we need the converting capacity. The acquisitions integrate \u2013 the U.S. Corrugated acquisition integrates more than a 100,000 tons of containerboard with another 50,000 tons committed in a long-term agreement.", "Island Container serves an outstanding host of customers in the New York and New Jersey area and will integrate another 80,000 tons of containerboard. The integration of these facilities and the commercial teams is well underway and will improve our Corrugated Packaging business in a number of ways, including increasing our integration level by 300 basis points from 70% to 73%.", "Let\u2019s turn to the details of our third quarter performance. Sales for the quarter were $3.7 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $598 million for a consolidated margin of 16.2%. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.74. Pre-tax income was favorably impacted by $13 million from the sale of our equity interest in ArborGen.", "We\u2019re benefiting from favorable demand and price trends across our portfolio. We expect to achieve the full $50 per ton corrugated price increase that was published in April by the end of September. We\u2019re implementing several published price increases within our consumer grades that are beginning to offset last year\u2019s index price reductions.", "Total commodity inflation was $123 million headwind year-over-year. OCC accounted for $81 million or the vast majority of the increase. The sequential increase of $13 per ton, the average price of OCC, was consistent with our expectations at the beginning of the quarter.", "Our leverage ratio of 2.58 times was consistent with our expectations, was slightly above the high end of our targeted leverage ratio of 2.25 to 2.5 times. We expect our strong cash flow to quickly bring us to within our targeted leverage ratio without compromising our ability to make investments to strengthen our business.", "The WestRock Corrugated Packaging team executed extremely well in the quarter. We implemented price increases across each one of our channels. We integrated the Star Pizza and U.S. Corrugated containerboard supply into our system. We grew back volumes by providing unique and differentiated solutions to our customers.", "Our operating rates remained high at 96%. We set production records at our West Point, Seminole and Florence mills. The solid commercial and operating results were partially offset by the negative impact of inflation.", "Overall, North American corrugated segment shipments were flat compared to the prior-year period, as strong gains in our domestic mill and box shipments offset lower export and pulp shipments. North American adjusted EBITDA margins were 18.8%. This was an increase of 50 basis points year-over-year and 290 basis points sequentially.", "North American per day box shipments increased by 5.7% compared to last year and was 4.2% when excluding recent acquisitions. The 4.2% increase was driven by our commercial team and strong demand in consumer, e-commerce and selected food service markets.", "Our export containerboard shipments of 260,000 tons were 16% below last year and 22% below the March quarter. This intentional shift of tons from lower margin export accounts to more profitable domestic customers favorably impacted overall price mix.", "With the recent acquisitions, we\u2019ve increased our integration and we will continue to optimize our channel mix. We expect that going forward, our annual export volume will be less than 1 million tons as compared to 1.2 million tons for the trailing 12 months ending June.", "We took approximately 45,000 tons of maintenance downtime in the quarter and no containerboard economic downtime. It\u2019s worth noting that in the year-ago period, we took 72,000 tons of economic downtime.", "Inventory levels remained flat as compared to the prior quarter. In the September quarter, we expect to increase our inventory position by approximately 70,000 tons so that we consistently achieve high on-time delivery rates to our customers as we prepare for upcoming mill maintenance outages in the first half of fiscal 2018.", "In July, WestRock\u2019s average daily box volumes increased 10% compared to last year and 6% when excluding newly acquired companies. We\u2019ve got the right momentum in our North American Corrugated Packaging business.", "Our joint venture with Grupo Gondi performed well in the June quarter. The paper and packaging markets in Mexico are growing, and our partners at Grupo Gondi are investing to meet this growing demand. Gondi is expanding its box plant capacity across the country.", "Paper supply in Mexico is extremely tight and expansions are underway at our mills in Mexico City and Guadalajara. Gondi has announced plans to construct a new state-of-the-art 350,000-ton recycled lightweight containerboard mill, which will be the largest machine in Mexico.", "This additional capacity will ensure Gondi is very well positioned for growth with their customers in Mexico.

EBITDA margins were 25% for the period, up 570 basis points sequentially and 230 basis points over the prior year.", "Driven by our talented team, high-quality assets and positive markets, we continue to explore opportunities to improve and expand our presence in Brazil. Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with how the WestRock Corrugated Packaging team performed during the June quarter.", "Consumer Packaging team also performed extremely well in the June quarter. Overall shipments declined due to planned outages at Evadale and Demopolis, and this resulted in 47,000 less tons of pulp sold. Shipments of paperboard and converted products increased 18,000 tons or 2% on a year-over-year basis.", "Industry backlogs have increased with CRB up 9% and SBS up 37% both on a year-over-year basis. Our backlogs have improved through the quarter and currently stand at between five weeks and six weeks on SBS and CNK and approximately two weeks on CRB.", "Our markets are mixed with ongoing demand softness in processed foods, tobacco and commercial print, which is offset by strength in food service, liquid packaging, health and beauty markets. The beverage season has been solid with warmer than expected weather in Europe and parts of the United States.", "We\u2019re winning through differentiation in our enterprise sales approach, which brings the best of WestRock\u2019s capabilities to create value for our customers. We\u2019re now at a $15 million annual revenue run rate for EnShield. This is our barrier-grade paperboard for grease and oil resistance. We\u2019ve also introduced a new fully compostable paperboard for hot drink cups and that\u2019s gaining a great deal of interest from our major food service converting customers.", "We\u2019re winning with new machinery commitments from our largest beverage customers and from customers in the growing craft brew market, including we\u2019ve received our first orders for our 1210 Combo machine, which automates both solid fiber multipacks and corrugated trays into a single integrated solution. This is a great example of our ability to provide integrated solutions across our portfolio to our customers.", "Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $230 million or 15% of sales. The year-over-year decline was a result of planned maintenance downtime, higher input cost and the flow-through from previously-published price reductions.", "We\u2019re implementing published price increases across every grade as we enter fiscal 2018. Input cost inflation unfavorably impacted the segment by $29 million from cost increases in recycled fiber, chemicals and energy.", "Our Consumer Packaging team delivered another strong productivity quarter with $50 million of improvement that helped offset cost inflation. We\u2019re realizing improvements from procurement savings, return-generating capital projects and converting footprint optimization.", "And the Covington Mill team executed extremely well on productivity improvement projects and capital investments. This is a direct result of the Covington team\u2019s efforts with the production record they set during the quarter.", "We have numerous opportunities to invest internally in our business, and our Board just approved a $57 million project to rebuild the cutter section of one of our paper machines at the Mahrt Mill. The rebuild includes a new carton box cutter. In addition to providing an attractive return, this investment will increase both the quality and flexibility of our production at the Mahrt Mill when it\u2019s completed in the spring of 2019.", "Ward, I\u2019ll turn it over to you.", "Ward Dickson", "Thank you, Steve. In our Land and Development segment, we drove strong sales activity across raw land, industrial and commercial properties. We\u2019ve previously stepped up these assets to fair market value and realized no income in the quarter as sales prices were in line with previous estimates. I will remind you that last quarter we announced that Land and Development activity is excluded from adjusted EPS.", "We\u2019re making very good progress on the remaining portfolio and believe that we\u2019ll recognize between $150 million and $175 million of after-tax proceeds in fiscal 2017.

I\u2019d like to point out that this goal, issued last November, has remained constant through one of the most rapidly changing business environments that we can remember. We\u2019re proud of our ability to meet our commitments to our stockholders and look forward to closing out the year on a strong note.", "For the fourth quarter, we expect sequential adjusted earnings per diluted share higher than the $0.74 achieved in the third quarter.

Based on our regional consumption mix, our average index price paid per ton for OCC in the second fiscal quarter was a $147. In the third fiscal quarter, that increased by $13 to a $160, in line with our expectations.", "Note that the average July index price for WestRock was $177 per ton. Therefore, we expect an average cost per ton in the fourth quarter to increase sequentially by $15 to $20 per ton to between $175 and $180. However, noting the volatility that we\u2019ve seen this year, predicting recycled fiber cost remains difficult.", "This assumption, when paired with chemicals and fuel costs, results in a sequential cost increase between $25 million and $30 million in the fourth fiscal quarter. Third, we anticipate aggregate incremental EBITDA of between $50 million and $55 million from the previously announced acquisitions.", "Additional items that you will need to consider in your sequential modeling aggregate to approximately $0.13 to $0.14 negative impact to adjusted earnings per share. Increased interest expense is approximately $0.01 to $0.02 unfavorable.

The gain on ArborGen, slightly increased share count and other non-recurring items are a $0.01 negative sequential impact.", "Finally, I anticipate that you will have questions about our expectations for fiscal 2018. As we enter our third year as WestRock, I\u2019m pleased with the momentum that we have with our customers and across our businesses. We are finalizing our operating plan for next year, and we believe that we are well positioned to drive growth in EBITDA and operating cash flow.", "We have attractive opportunities to invest in high-return capital projects that improve our competitiveness. With these opportunities, along with the addition of MPS, I expect capital investments in fiscal 2018 will be higher than the 750 million that we plan to invest in fiscal 2017. During our next earnings call, we will provide full year fiscal 2018 guidance. We will continue to be disciplined in our allocation of capital.", "And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Steve.", "Steven Voorhees", "Thanks, Ward. We\u2019ve made substantial progress over the past two years transforming our portfolio and building a leader in paper and packaging. The WestRock team is well positioned and committed to working together to improve our margins, grow our cash flows and help our customers achieve their goals through our comprehensive portfolio of paper and packaging solutions and our strong execution.", "We\u2019ll use our consistent and growing cash flow to reinvest in our business and make acquisitions that improve our business. We expect to return capital to stockholders by increasing our dividend over time and repurchasing shares within our target leverage ratio. I believe that this is a formula that provides significant opportunities for WestRock employees, customers and investors over the short and long term.", "Matt, that concludes my prepared remarks. We\u2019re ready for Q&A.", "Matt Tractenberg", "Thank you, Steve. As a reminder to our audience, please limit your questions to one with a follow-up, if needed. We\u2019ll get to as many as time allows. Jack, can you take our first question please?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Brian Maguire", "Hi. Good morning, guys.", "Steven Voorhees", "Good morning.", "Brian Maguire", "Steve, the box shipments continue to be at a little bit of a faster growth rate than you were in, in the recent couple of years I think up 4.2 organically, 5.7 with M&A. I was wondering if you could talk about what you\u2019d attribute the acceleration to, if you\u2019re seeing any particular end markets that are growing a little bit faster than others or regionally, if there\u2019s anything you\u2019d call out. And then maybe give us a little bit of color on how trends were in July?", "Steven Voorhees", "Okay. Jeff?", "Jeff Chalovich", "Sure. Good morning, Brian. So I\u2019ll start with \u2013 in the quarter, we experienced growth in most of our market segments, notably pizza. And so you\u2019ll recall we just executed an acquisition of Star Pizza, which put us in the specialty pizza niche. We have a large share of large pizza and large franchises, but that was a place we didn\u2019t have. Also, we had a few promotional pieces with the big four that drove increased sales.", "And then our food service packaging in general is up. We\u2019re well positioned in that market based on investments we\u2019ve made both in Star Pizza, high- speed rotary die cutters that are multiple colors and then our white top position in the markets. So that\u2019s helping us differentiate and grow sales effectively in that market.", "Also, we continue to grow in segments enabled by EVOLs and our automated packaging system. And that\u2019s really what we\u2019ve seen in our retail and consumer segments. Although some of the larger companies aren\u2019t growing, we\u2019re penetrating that market based on investments we made and customers who value taking total cost out of their systems. And so our automated packaging systems give us the ability to take the back of the house, eliminate labor, reduce total cost and give them automated packaging solutions in their businesses.", "And then finally, we continue to grow from e-commerce which again is up significantly. And we\u2019re benefited by our scale and then the platform investments we\u2019ve made again in EVOLs. We can run short runs, custom orders, long runs, small boxes. So we can run a mix of business on those Flexos from mini all the way up to 50-inch business. And it\u2019s really positioned us well in the markets. And over time, we expect to continue to grow.", "Steven Voorhees", "July?", "Jeff Chalovich", "July, I would say the same figures \u2013 we see the same segments growing. 10% is organic -- or 10% total, 6% organic in our business. The markets are strong in all of our channels; export, domestic and box. And we continue to grow with our customers. And we continue to execute new field basics [ph]. Our customers are pleased with what we\u2019re doing. We deliver high-quality boxes on time and complete, and we do the same thing in our market segments and channels in domestic and export. And our backlogs remain strong. Inventories are stable, but tight and our demand is strong in most of our segments.", "Brian Maguire", "Okay. Thanks for that. Just one follow-up. Maybe this one\u2019s for Bob. Just with the inflation you\u2019ve had in OCC, it seems like a renewed effort from the industry to try and get some CRB pricing. And I know the one over the summer didn\u2019t meet with a lot of success. But maybe you can kind of comment on how those conversations are going now and what your kind of outlook is for CRB pricing over the next couple of months?", "Robert Feeser", "Hi, Brian, I can\u2019t comment on pricing related with our customers, but I can say that our CRB system is much stronger during this last quarter. We\u2019re seeing a bit of strength. But over the last four or five quarters, it\u2019s been very, very stable. So we like our CRB business quite a bit and we\u2019re continuing to take steps to strengthen the business.", "Brian Maguire", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Your line is open.", "George Staphos", "Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details and congratulations on the progress. I guess my first question broadly is on acquisitions. You\u2019ve obviously acquired a number of businesses in paperboard converting over the last year, some very recent. Can you relay to us what findings you have thus far? Any surprises, either positive or negative relative to any of the businesses? Obviously, MPS is the largest. And if we think about the aggregate EBITDA that you\u2019ve acquired, what would you place it at? I know you said 50 million to 55 million incremental in the fiscal fourth quarter. But on a gross basis annualized, what do you think that EBITDA amounts to across all the businesses? And then I had a follow-on.", "Steven Voorhees", "This is Steve. I haven\u2019t done the math on what the aggregate EBITDA is that we\u2019ve acquired. Let\u2019s talk about the acquisition opportunities that we have. When we put WestRock together, the idea is that we were going to be able to grow the business. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing. And the acquisitions that we\u2019ve made, I think fit extremely well with our portfolio. And they add to our portfolio. And really without exception, the opportunities that we have as a result of the acquisitions have been I think very positive.", "And I\u2019d say \u2013 now we had an expectation that they\u2019d be positive. Otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t have done the acquisitions. But the chemistry that we have as an organization that we\u2019re building, we\u2019ve been able to I think really combine our businesses and really enhance our overall portfolio. So I\u2019ve been very pleased with the acquisitions that we\u2019ve made. They\u2019ve been really on our business strategy. And really that\u2019s what I\u2019ve got to say.", "George Staphos", "Okay.", "Ward Dickson", "And George, this is Ward. The contribution in the third fiscal quarter of the acquisitions, it was really only MPS and it was less than 15 million of EBITDA given the timing of the close. So you can take that and the sequential number to get the \u2013 get kind of a run rate. And then the contribution of the converting acquisitions; Star, U.S. Corrugated, Island Container and Hannapak, I would put that in the range of less than $40 million before synergies on an annual basis. And then you -- ", "George Staphos", "Understood.", "Ward Dickson", "Yes, you\u2019ll understand the EPS historical numbers \u2013 I mean the MPS historical numbers.", "George Staphos", "Correct, that\u2019s helpful, Ward. My second question and I\u2019ll turn it over. From our vantage point, the management of cost inflation was quite good. You were pretty much in line with your guidance from the third quarter I think which was \u2013 or the second quarter \u2013 for the third quarter of 125 million, yet it seemed like inflation pressures were more or less building over the course of the quarter. Can you remind us what you might have done to manage the inflation either through purchasing scale, fiber substitution, et cetera? And how important will price be as a lever to managing that going forward relative to past years, particularly in the boxboard piece? Thanks, guys.", "Ward Dickson", "George, this is Ward. I\u2019ll start with Q3 and talk about our outperformance versus the guidance. So really our price, box volumes and productivity were better than what we anticipated. I would say that the inflation just came in slightly above the high end of the range that we gave you in the quarter. And then clearly, the lower tax rate in ArborGen \u2013 the ArborGen gain contributed to the benefit and then our guidance at the beginning of the quarter excluded MPS. So the real driver for us in terms of the outperformance was stronger productivity, stronger volumes, stronger box volumes than we anticipated.", "As you look at the year, I think it\u2019s incredible that we are able to maintain the $1.2 billion free cash flow guidance. If you go back to the inflation guidance that I gave on raw material at the beginning of the year, I said it was going to be $175 million to $200 million. And as we go through Q4, that number is going to approach $400 million. And we\u2019ve been able to maintain the free cash flow guidance because we\u2019ve been able to drive stronger volumes and we\u2019ve realized price increases across all of our businesses.", "And in addition, we\u2019ve generated more productivity than what we expected at the beginning of the year. To me, it reinforces the need for us to constantly drive productivity across our businesses and also the commercial excellence that we demonstrate by focusing on markets that we think that we can win in.", "George Staphos", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Your line is open.", "Anthony Pettinari", "Hi. Good morning.", "Steven Voorhees", "Good morning, Anthony.", "Anthony Pettinari", "In containerboard, a number of your competitors have talked about debottlenecking opportunities and given some tonnage figures on the recent calls. Given you and the industry appear to be running close to full out, do you plan to add any capacity in your current mill footprint?", "Jeff Chalovich", "Good morning, Anthony. It\u2019s Jeff. So currently, we like the position we\u2019re in and see our best opportunities to increase free cash flow and our North American EBITDA margins by further integrating our North American box system with our mill system, and then continue to invest in our mill system to reduce our cost profile. We just executed three acquisitions in the last four months to enable us to further integrate our capital investments in the box plant system, support that integration and growth with our customers. And we continue to invest in the mill system to reduce our cost profile.", "We have good optionality to manage our channel mix and reduce the tail of our least profitable channels and export and move that into North American domestic and box shipments. So we\u2019re well positioned I think to provide our customers with differentiated products, innovative solutions. And we\u2019re going to continue to execute that strategy and disciplined capital execution plan. And we\u2019re confident in our ability to continue to compete and win in the market, regardless of what happens from other investments sometime in the future.", "Anthony Pettinari", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, Ward, in the 4Q guidance, you gave a 65 million to 75 million benefit from vol, price mix and productivity. Understanding these are all ranges and that they\u2019re going to move around in the quarter, is it possible to roughly say how much you would split into those three buckets of the 65 million to 75 million?", "Ward Dickson", "The largest bucket is the pricing benefit for the continued implementation of the previously published price increases, specifically across our corrugated segment. So that\u2019s by far the largest bucket, followed by the sequential productivity and then the smallest would be the incremental volume.", "Anthony Pettinari", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Gabe Hajde", "Good morning, gentlemen. This is actually Gabe sitting in for Chris. A quick question on the consumer business. I think it was earlier this week there was an announcement from the FDA about tobacco products. Just curious if you could parse out what piece of the consumer business has exposure there. I think most of it is in the SBS side, but \u2013 and I appreciate some of that\u2019s international. But just give us a sense for maybe how those volumes have been tracking and how much of that business is exposed there? Thanks.", "Jeff Chalovich", "Yes, the majority of our tobacco SBS business is international. It\u2019s roughly 80% of the total that we do. And the volumes have been relatively stable. Clearly, there is sequential decline \u2013 or secular decline in the market overall. We play in pockets of the market that are very much in the premium high-end brands of tobacco. And we have identified opportunities to grow the business in China, in particular. So those are areas that have been important to maintain our volume profile in the tobacco market.", "Gabe Hajde", "Okay. And perhaps maybe this is for Steve. But just \u2013 you mentioned some opportunities too in Brazil in the corrugated operations to either improve or expand. Can you elaborate on that a little bit for us?", "Steven Voorhees", "Yes, Jim Porter\u2019s here. I\u2019m going to let Jim take that question.", "James Porter", "Good morning, Dave. First of all, we really love our Brazil business. We\u2019ve got just an outstanding team and a strategy and an asset portfolio in Brazil that really continues to execute extremely well. Brazil is an attractive market for us with over 200 million people consuming products that need our packaging solutions every day. And we are focused on expanding in that region beyond our current organic capabilities, and we have several projects that are under consideration. I\u2019d have to say the growth in our corrugated packaging capability is our current priority.", "Gabe Hajde", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Mark Wilde", "Good morning.", "Steven Voorhees", "Good morning, Mark.", "Mark Wilde", "I\u2019d like to come back to the \u2013 on that CapEx and debottlenecking question, because it sounded like from Jeff\u2019s commentary that the focus in kind of containerboard is going to continue to be on increasing integration and taking out costs rather than increasing supply at all. And I wondered if you could confirm that.", "Jeff Chalovich", "I think you summarized it. This is Jeff. Mark, I think you summarized it very well.", "Mark Wilde", "Okay. And then, Ward, just a point of clarification. I think you just mentioned $15 million in benefit from incremental EBITDA coming out of MPS. But in the slide deck, the number is 5 million. So can you help us reconcile that?", "Ward Dickson", "Is that the segment income or EBITDA? It\u2019s MPS and other. So there\u2019s some \u2013 if you look on the consumer bridge, there\u2019s $14 million of EBITDA from MPS. There\u2019s $2 million of negative foreign exchange and there are some of the costs associated with the maintenance outage that we\u2019ve had. So that\u2019s the reconciliation.", "Mark Wilde", "Okay, all right, that\u2019s fine. Last question, I just wondered, Steve, the announcement that we had about four weeks ago from David S. Smith about their entry into North America. I wondered if you could give us some thoughts on that. I think you guys have had a relationship, some technology sharing, with David S. Smith. And I\u2019d like to know whether this deal changes that relationship.", "Steven Voorhees", "Jeff is closest to that relationship, so I\u2019m going to let Jeff respond.", "Jeff Chalovich", "Hi, Mark. No, it doesn\u2019t change the relationship at all. We continue to work with them in the machine space, and we\u2019ll continue to do so.", "Mark Wilde", "Okay, very good. I\u2019ll turn it over.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.", "Mark Weintraub", "Thank you. I was hoping to get more color on containerboard export markets and maybe understand a little bit more as you\u2019re repatriating more tons. Is that sort of evenly across the different export markets, or are you taking it out of one region versus another? And are there different pricing and market dynamics in the different regions that maybe speak to that?", "Jeff Chalovich", "Hi, Mark. It\u2019s Jeff. Our preponderance of our export is still Latin America \u2013 Mexico, Latin America and that remains the same. And then we have \u2013 it\u2019s almost two-thirds of our export. And then we have some smaller positions in Asia, Europe. So we\u2019re really concentrating on Latin America, Western Europe. We\u2019re moving into Eastern Europe a bit and then a small amount in Asia. We\u2019ve exited some markets in Africa \u2013 sum of customers more specifically in the specific markets, including all the ones I\u2019ve just called out. And really it\u2019s that tail of the export. I\u2019d refer you to what Pulp & Paper\u2019s published on pricing and that would give you a guide of the different areas in pricing. And we have executed, as we said on previous calls, price increases in those areas. And again, we are managing the tail of that channel.", "Mark Weintraub", "Great. I believe that there are some new pricing initiatives in Europe on the kraft linerboard side. Are we seeing anything of that sort in the Latin American or Mexican markets?", "Jeff Chalovich", "I can\u2019t really speak to the future pricing. You\u2019ve seen what was published in Europe. Then we\u2019ll have to wait and see what happens in the other markets.", "Mark Weintraub", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical. Your line is open.", "Chip Dillon", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "Steven Voorhees", "Good morning, Chip.", "Chip Dillon", "A question I had was \u2013 the first one is I think, Ward, you all laid out the increase in the cost saves you expect. You expect to go from a 760 I believe, you said, annual run rate now to 825 at the end of the fiscal year or just this quarter. So that would suggest about a $17 million absolute improvement, you divide that difference by 4. And I\u2019m just wondering in the guidance bridge, is that 17 million an offset to the cost pressures or is that part of the $65 million to $75 million number? I\u2019m just trying to figure out where that 17 is?", "Ward Dickson", "So when you try to bridge from run rate to sequential earnings changes, it\u2019s not that elegant. So we can actually execute a project in the last two weeks of the quarter, and we capture it into the run rate. And so again, we will have some sequential productivity improvements from the actions that we\u2019ve had. We\u2019ve embedded it in the guidance, but it\u2019s not as precise as you described.", "Chip Dillon", "Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. And then the last one \u2013 second one is looking at the consumer area; two things. One, I think, Steve, you mentioned the backlog in CRB was two weeks, which I either misheard you but that strikes me as a little bit low. And then secondly, you mentioned the Mahrt project that will come on in about I guess 18 or so months. How much downtime will that involve? And when do you expect that downtime to occur?", "Steven Voorhees", "Bob?", "Robert Feeser", "Chip, so the two weeks that we\u2019ve referenced on the backlogs for CRB is a pretty normal level for us and it\u2019s in part just how we manage our internal system, which is a big driver of the backlogs. But we have in general seen a bit of firming over the last quarter. And then on the Mahrt project, we\u2019re really excited about this opportunity to really improve the quality of our product overall and provide more flexibility to the market in general. And that project will be completed during an outage in March of 2019, and it\u2019s roughly about a 28-day outage that will take place on that machine in March of 2019.", "Chip Dillon", "Got you, very helpful. Real quickly, I noticed that a major or small for North America producer of corrugated packaging announced a pretty large box plant in New Jersey. It looks like it\u2019s going to eat up about 200,000 tons. Obviously, I\u2019m talking Cascades. And that would mean for them an integration move that\u2019s pretty significant. Does that mean you might have more opportunities to sell board up from Solvay and I guess other mills in that general region on the open market, or otherwise do you see \u2013 how do you see that move impacting you all?", "Jeff Chalovich", "I\u2019m sorry, Chip. I missed the new corrugated place in New Jersey. I didn\u2019t hear what you said.", "Chip Dillon", "Yes. It was announced this morning. Maybe you didn\u2019t see it. But Cascades is announcing a plant that\u2019s going to create 2.4 billion square feet of boxes, which will be about 0.5% I guess of North America, and we would guess around 200,000 tons of cut-up in Piscataway. And so assuming that is true, which I\u2019m reading here, I would imagine that that eats up a lot of their board from their relatively new machine and some of their other capacity, it integrates it. So I just didn\u2019t know if that opens up more opportunities for you all with your very profitable Solvay Mill.", "Jeff Chalovich", "It\u2019s possible. We have a large position with our box plants currently there. But we\u2019re always looking at our mix and our customer base. And it\u2019s one of our most profitable channels, our domestic market. So we like that market. And I can\u2019t say yet, but I\u2019m sure that as we get more clarity, we\u2019ll be able to decide if that works in our system or not.", "Chip Dillon", "Okay. They\u2019re saying they\u2019re spending $80 million, so it\u2019s got to be a big one. Anyway, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Philip Ng", "Hi, guys. You\u2019ve made a few bolt-ons recently to enhance your integration level both from your consumer and corrugated side. Is there like a target integration level you would like to achieve over the medium term? And are you signing more opportunities in one segment versus the other?", "Jeff Chalovich", "Phil, I\u2019ll talk to the corrugated. We\u2019d like to move our integration level up to the 80% range and that would mean our export is basically down to 10%. We like the optionality with that to manage our mix and our channels and then the low ends of whatever channel there is there, we think it gives us more optionality. So we\u2019re targeting 80% in corrugated.", "Steven Voorhees", "Phil, the opportunities we have are balanced across our company. One of the benefits that we have at WestRock is we can look at opportunities in both consumer and corrugated and also across different geographies, like the acquisitions that we\u2019ve made are representative of that.", "Philip Ng", "Okay, that\u2019s great. And I guess longer term, bigger picture, looks like you\u2019re finding still pretty good capital projects with good returns. But longer term, to offset inflation as you wrap up this $1 billion synergy target, how should we think about productivity going forward?", "Jeff Chalovich", "I think to be successful and to offset normal inflation, we need to be in the $275 million to $300 million of annual productivity.", "Ward Dickson", "And I believe that we \u2013 this year we obviously have had spikes in energy and natural gas \u2013 I mean in OCC. But if you just look at a steady state ongoing wage inflation environment and input cost environment, it reinforces the need for us to constantly drive productivity. And my estimate would be a $275 million to over $300 million on an ongoing basis.", "Philip Ng", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks a lot.", "Matt Tractenberg", "Jack, next question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Lars Kjellberg with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Lars Kjellberg", "Thank you. Just one question on the consumer board. As you continue to integrate significant volumes in that segment, can you bring us through the pricing dynamics as you raise prices for SBS, CRB, CNK, et cetera? And can you also confirm that your intention to convert pulp into more paperboard to continue to have the open market exposure that you\u2019ve had prior to MPS?", "Robert Feeser", "Lars, this is Bob Feeser. We can\u2019t comment on pricing, but \u2013 as we\u2019ve indicated that we see a great opportunity to integrate the 100,000 tons of paperboard consumption from MPS, and we\u2019ll continue to do that and reduce our overall production of pulp in our SBS system. That\u2019s a very attractive proposition for our business overall. And then clearly, additional paperboard-related acquisitions, we have additional headroom for future integration as well. But at the same time, we have very attractive business in the external market with very good converting customers that are very valued to us. So that will continue to be a very important part of our strategy overall.", "Lars Kjellberg", "So there is no formulistic pass-through of index prices into the carton side, or how should I think about that?", "Robert Feeser", "I\u2019m sorry.", "Steven Voorhees", "Lars, could you repeat that?", "Lars Kjellberg", "Similar to box prices, if there\u2019s no index for the Pulp & Paper Week price index transfer of higher board prices into cartons?", "Matt Tractenberg", "I\u2019m not sure we understand the question, Lars, but we can take it offline, okay?", "Lars Kjellberg", "Okay.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Your line is open.", "Adam Josephson", "Hi. Good morning. Steve, just a question on e-commerce. I know you mentioned it was beneficial to your box demand in the quarter. You\u2019d previously said you thought overall box demand wouldn\u2019t significantly change as a result of the growth in e-commerce. And over the last year, it seems like box demand has really picked up, partly or if not mostly, on account of e-commerce. Do you think differently today than you perhaps did a year ago about the impact of e-commerce on the alignment? And relatedly, what do you think the impact of e-commerce growth has been on the ramp in OCC inflation that you talked about earlier?", "Steven Voorhees", "I\u2019m going to let Jeff talk about our expectations for e-commerce now. And then I\u2019ll talk about the impact on the recovered fiber stream after Jeff talks about the overall increase in demand in e-commerce.", "Jeff Chalovich", "Hi, Adam. ", "Adam Josephson", "Hi, Jeff.", "Jeff Chalovich", "So e-commerce \u2013 good morning. There is an effect and it\u2019s on \u2013 it has been a net positive for corrugated, but I think it\u2019s important to talk about some the macroeconomic things going on in our business, because it\u2019s just not that. So the GDP in the second quarter was a healthy 2.6%. The ISM Purchasing Managers Index rose to 57.8 in June from 54.9 in May. So the index continues to indicate growth in the manufacturing sector. New Orders Index rose to 63.5 in June with 15 of those 18 industries reporting growth. And then the nondurable industrial production rose to 1.5% year-over-year, and that\u2019s after averaging 0.3% growth over the prior 12 months.", "So there\u2019s growth in our segments, and we\u2019re seeing that across the board in some of these smaller food and beverage companies, even if things like Big Beard on craft beer is growing. Noncarbonated beverages are growing. So some of the reports of some of the large accounts or customers being down are really being offset by other pieces of the market. There\u2019s industrial growth. E-commerce is fueling it, and it\u2019s net positive. But there\u2019s a lot of other positives going on across multiple markets and segments.", "Steven Voorhees", "And just on the impact on e-commerce. We have a very nice recycling business, and we operate a number of facilities across the country. Four of those facilities are single-stream recycling facilities. They collect the entire recyclable stream from \u2013 so this would include pulp boxes, newspapers, plastics, aluminum. So the four facilities process 300,000 tons per year and we monitor the collections of OCC from these facilities because we obviously want to get that OCC integrated into our mills. And the collections from those facilities have grown by 8% over the past year. And it\u2019s not surprising because I think everybody is using corrugated packaging as it\u2019s intended to protect the products that they are shipping and it helps as a great way to market your product. And so that\u2019s coming into the homes and it\u2019s showing up in the waste room.", "Adam Josephson", "Got it. And just, Ward, one clarification. You\u2019re expecting no further OCC price increases from July. Is that right?", "Ward Dickson", "Yes, in the 175 to 180 range, we\u2019re at 177. So it would imply that it would be stable. Obviously, that will be an element of volatility to the forecast that we have for the quarter.", "Adam Josephson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity Research. Your line is open.", "Gail Glazerman", "Hi. Good morning. Maybe just following up on that. If you don\u2019t necessarily think e-commerce is driving OCC, can you just talk fundamentally about what you think has driven it? And maybe taking kind of a medium-term view on where you see it going, do you think it can hold at these levels, not just this quarter, but moving forward? And how that changes how you think about your business?", "Steven Voorhees", "Yes, sure. So let\u2019s talk about this in kind of a broader perspective. Like if you look at world demand for containerboard, it\u2019s been growing at a low single-digit rate for the past several years. Like recently, we\u2019ve seen demand increase even faster. We\u2019ve seen box demand increased 3% in the U.S. the first six months of this year. Increasing demand for containerboard is served by OCC. And so far this year, we\u2019ve seen demand for OCC increase 5% worldwide, 3.6% in North America. And then China, it\u2019s increased by 7%. And as I said, increase in demand \u2013 and we\u2019re seeing changing supply trends because of e-commerce that we just spoke about. I think that helps \u2013 explains what\u2019s happened to prices.", "Now in perspective, our average fiber price over the past 12 months, so this would be the 12 months ending June, was $130 per ton. That means at the current price, $177 per ton, and our annual consumption of 4.9 million tons, we\u2019re going to have fiber price headwinds to overcome for the next several quarters because the math would indicate that. Now over time, if you look at this on a [indiscernible] it looks like prices are high. And so we would expect there to be some moderation in the price over time. We don\u2019t have a clear crystal ball on that.", "So I don\u2019t know where it would be between historical levels and current levels, but we\u2019d expect some moderation. So we look at that. We look at it carefully. If you think about the situation, it\u2019s like a nice problem to have because that means the driver is increased demand for paper and packaging. And that\u2019s our business. So we\u2019re participating in the demand trends. And I think paper and packaging are great products to serve attractive markets. And so that\u2019s where we are, Gail. And I think from WestRock\u2019s perspective, I really like our position because we\u2019re balanced. We\u2019re 60% virgin, 40% recovered fiber. And so we\u2019re well positioned to adapt to whatever scenario plays out.", "Gail Glazerman", "Okay. Thank you. And just one last one. As you look to trying to drive integration in corrugated from 73% to towards 80%, just what type of open market opportunity in terms of that M&A that you\u2019ve been doing do you see remaining? And how much of that might have to be integrated and organic?", "James Porter", "Hi, Gail. It\u2019s Jim. So it\u2019s a mix of both. I think that if you look at roughly 70,000 tons is about 1 point for us. So yes, there is available M&A in the market. Although some of the independents; it\u2019s smaller, there are still opportunities in the market to expand. And then our box volumes are strong. We expect to be able to grow with the market organically. And we see the opportunity to get to the 80 as a realistic goal.", "Gail Glazerman", "Okay. And I don\u2019t suppose you want to put a scale on what you see \u2013 what percentage you see as independent market at this point?", "Jeff Chalovich", "It\u2019s hard to say. There\u2019s multiple ways to look at it. The FBA looks at it \u2013 the independents that are tied to some type of containerboard mills and then there\u2019s not. So it\u2019s a 20-ish percentile range of independents and those that aren\u2019t tied to mills is 10 to 13. It\u2019s not an exact science, but there\u2019s 20% out there and over 10%, I would say, that aren\u2019t tied to boards that are still operating.", "Matt Tractenberg", "Jack, we\u2019re going to take one last question please.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of James Armstrong with Armstrong Investment. Your line is open.", "James Armstrong", "Good morning and thanks for fitting me in.", "Steven Voorhees", "Good morning.", "James Armstrong", "The first question is could you talk about the drivers in the Brazil business? That was actually a great number. I just was wondering, is that sustainable and could it continue to grow? And what are you doing different in that market?", "Ward Dickson", "Thank you, James. So as I said, we really are quite proud of our Brazil business. The team and the strategy and the assets just continued to perform extremely well against a very difficult backdrop. But that backdrop we think is improving. We are seeing signs that the business climate in Brazil is improving. And our EBITDA margins returned this quarter to its more normal 25%-ish range. And that\u2019s due to a very strong volume growth, realization of price increases, productivity.", "We\u2019ve just got a lot of tools in that Brazilian business between our very high-performing forestry assets, literally the \u2013 one of the lowest-cost virgin containerboard mills in the world and a portfolio of packaging assets that are focused on differentiated packaging solution. So that combination really has produced a winning situation for us. And as we\u2019ve said, we look to continue to invest and grow in that market.", "James Armstrong", "Okay, that helps. And then switching \u2013 coming back to exports out of North America. Could you talk a little bit more about your long-term thinking, getting that down to 10%? Would there ever be a scenario where you want to be at zero exports, or do you think exports will be a continued strong part of your business?", "Jeff Chalovich", "Hi, James. It\u2019s Jeff. I think exports will remain a strong part of the business. We don\u2019t want to be overexposed, but we like the markets. The world needs virgin kraft fiber. We supply it. So it just gives us optionality in the three channels that we supply and that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for.", "Matt Tractenberg", "Jack, I think that\u2019s all that we have time for today.", "Operator", "I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to the presenters.", "Matt Tractenberg", "Thank you. And thank you to our audience for joining the call today. As always, feel free to reach [Technical Difficulty]. Have a great day, everyone.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

My name is Sharon, and I will be your conference operator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the WestRock First Quarter Earnings Results Call and announcement of the acquisition of KapStone Paper and Packaging. ", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. James Armstrong, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "James Armstrong", "Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. We issued two press releases this morning, one concerning the quarterly results and another announcing our agreement to acquire KapStone Paper and Packaging Corporation.", "We have prepared slides to supplement our comments during today's conference call. You can find these on the Investor Relations section of our website. With me on today\u2019s call are Steve Voorhees, WestRock's Chief Executive Officer; Ward Dickson, our Chief Financial Officer; Jeff Chalovich, our President of Corrugated Packaging; and Bob Feeser, President of our Consumer Packaging segment. The call today will be an hour long and will end at 9:30 Eastern. Following our prepared comments, we will open up the call for Q&A.", "Before we begin, I'd like to point out that during the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we discuss during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the SEC, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.", "Additionally, we will be referencing non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation. The slide presentation is available on our website.", "So with that said, I'll turn it over to you, Steve.", "Steve Voorhees", "Thanks, James. Welcome to our team. I am pleased you have decided to join us at WestRock, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on short notice. ", "Before I get into the results of our first fiscal quarter and our agreement to acquire KapStone Paper and Packaging, I want to provide context for what we are doing at WestRock over the long-term.", "For those of you who joined us at Investor Day you will recognize this context. First, I believe paper and packaging are very attractive businesses, where scale and differentiation matter. Second, our team at WestRock is building a paper and packaging [leader] with a differentiated strategy and capabilities to generate attractive returns over the long term. And third, margin expansion and capital investment to provide WestRock the opportunity to generate $4 billion in adjusted EBITDA by 2022.", "The acquisition of KapStone fits extremely well into this context, and will accelerate the achievement of our near-term and long-term goals. Before I cover the acquisition, I want to cover our first fiscal quarter results that provide a relevant mile marker of progress towards our long-term objectives.", "Fiscal 2018 is off to a good start. Our adjusted earnings per share increased 85% and adjusted segment EBITDA increased 33% compared to last year. The results were driven by outstanding performance by our corrugated packaging team. Our adjusted book tax rate for the quarter was 25%. This compares to our guidance of 32% to 33% for an $0.08 per share benefit.", "We generated $374 million of adjusted operating cash flow in the seasonally low first fiscal quarter. In addition to strong operating results, we had three items in GAAP earnings that were adjusted out of our $0.87 of adjusted EPS. These items include first, a one-time tax benefit of tax benefit of $1.1 billion as a result of the reduction of our US corporate tax rate. Second, a charge of $180 million on a pre-tax basis to reflect potential future cash payments from our decision to exit a multiemployer pension plan. The majority of this liability is payable over a 20 year period. And third, $28 million of impairments in our land and development business, which were largely tied to reduced values for natural gas mineral rates.", "Sales for the quarter were $3.89 billion. This was a 13% increase over the prior year quarter. Total company adjusted segment EBITDA was up $164 million to $654 million, and adjusted segment EBITDA margins increased 260 basis points to 16.8%. This was driven largely by favorable price and mix.", "The corrugated packaging segment delivered outstanding results delivered by the full realization of previously published PPW domestic price increases, along with better export pricing, strong demand and favorable channel mix. Corrugated packaging adjusted segment EBITDA margins were 20.4% and were up 510 basis points year-over-year.", "Supply and demand fundamentals within our North American corrugated packaging business continued to be strong. We earned a 21.4 adjusted segment EBITDA margin in our North American corrugated packaging business in this quarter. This was a 560 basis point increase over last year. Our fiscal first-quarter North American daily box shipments increased 4% on a per day basis from the prior year period, and January shipments are also up approximately 4% year-over-year. ", "The demand environment for consumer packaging is stable. We delivered volume growth across several of our targeted end-markets, including food packaging, healthcare and personal care. These gains were offset by softness in North America mainstream beer, carbonated soft drinks and commercial print applications. Sales increased 17% and segment EBITDA increased 9% driven by the net impact from the MPS acquisition and the sale of our dispensing business.", "Backlogs across our mill systems were firm. SBS and CNK system backlogs are currently about five weeks and CRV backlogs are over two weeks with strong order inflow. ", "I'll now turn the call over now to Ward to provide more details on the quarter and guidance. Ward?", "Ward Dickson", "Thanks, Steve. As you know, executing our synergy and performance improvement goals is key to achieving our long-term objectives. We exited the December quarter at an annual run rate of $910 million and expect to achieve the billion dollar goal by the end of the third fiscal quarter. ", "Before I discuss second-quarter guidance, let us start with the positive impact of tax reform. WestRock recognized a one-time benefit in the quarter of approximately $1.1 billion. This benefit reflected the remeasurement of the company\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as the recognition of the tax liability for the mandatory deemed repatriation associated with foreign cash and earnings.", "With our September fiscal year we will receive nine months of benefit of the federal rate reduction in fiscal 2018, and expect our adjusted book tax rate to be approximately 27% this year, and approximately 26% in fiscal 2019. In the second fiscal quarter, we expect the combination of volume, price and mix to be positive in the range of $50 million to $60 million sequentially. Transportation costs are being negatively impacted by winter weather, higher diesel costs and truck and rail shortages driven by strong economic conditions.", "The winter weather is also driving virgin fiber costs higher by 2% to 3%. During the second fiscal quarter we expect moderate inflation in OCC prices. In total we expect total commodity inflation of $40 million to $45 million pre-tax. Winter weather may have an additional $15 million to $20 million sequential impact. To help you with your models, we have provided additional guidance on our tax rate and D&A.", "When all of these items are taken into account, we expect Q2 adjusted earnings per share to be slightly lower on a sequential basis, but significantly higher than last year's second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.54. We are reaffirming our previous sales and EBITDA guidance and raising our full year adjusted operating cash flow guidance to $2.45 billion due to a $150 million benefit from tax reform.", "I will turn it back over to you, Steve.", "Steve Voorhees", "Thanks Ward. I'm pleased to be able to announce that we have signed a definitive agreement to acquire KapStone Paper and Packaging. Before I get too far, I want to express my admiration for Roger Stone and Matt Kaplan and the entire KapStone team for what they have built since 2005.", "It is an incredible story. I have been able to spend more time than ever with Roger and Matt over the past few months, and it has only increased my regard for them as people and as businessmen. They are truly focused on their customers and their employees. They have delivered outstanding returns for investors.", "It has now been three years since we formed WestRock, and our team has been building a leading paper and packaging company. KapStone is an outstanding fit with our business. The corrugated packaging operations will enhance WestRock\u2019s North American corrugated packaging business and provide complementary products in geographical locations that will enable us to better serve customers across our system.", "The addition of the specialty and paper products to WestRock\u2019s portfolio further expands our comprehensive range of differentiated products into heavyweight [craft] grades that we currently do not produce. With the transaction, we also acquired Victory Packaging, a packaging solutions distribution company with more than 60 facilities in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Victory provides opportunities for WestRock to integrate our system further downstream to an expanded set of customers.", "I'm looking forward to welcoming KapStone employees to WestRock to provide them opportunities to sustain and advance their careers, and I'm looking forward to working with them to help make WestRock an even more successful company. We have a track record of successfully generating efficiency and productivity that increase performance and create value.", "The acquisition of KapStone is no exception as we expect, approximately $200 million in synergy and performance improvements, over half of which we think will be achieved within a year of closing. Combined with WestRock\u2019s current business, we believe the transaction will generate significant cash, enabling us to return to our targeted leverage ratio of 2.25 to 2.5 times in fiscal 2019, while continuing to invest in our core business. We believe the economics of the transaction are compelling.", "WestRock will pay $35 per share for a total enterprise value of $4.9 billion. The purchase price equates to less than 10 times KapStone\u2019s annualized EBITDA performance over the past six months, an attractive seven times after anticipated cost synergies and productivity improvements. Importantly, the transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to adjusted earnings and cash flow. We expect the transaction to close in the quarter ending September 30, 2018. ", "Let us turn to the structure of the transaction. Under the terms of the merger agreement, KapStone stockholders will receive $35 per share in cash. KapStone stockholders will have an option to elect to receive 0.4981 shares of WestRock stock in lieu of cash. This election will in aggregate be limited to 25% of the total consideration. This option gives KapStone stockholders the opportunity to participate in the future upside that the combined business on a tax-deferred basis.", "KapStone\u2019s chairman, Roger Stone, and president and CEO, Matt Kaplan, have entered into voting agreements to vote their shares in support of the transaction. We will fund the transaction through committed acquisition financing and existing liquidity.", "The combined company will have even greater capability to serve an expanded set of customers. On a combined basis, WestRock will generate nearly $20 billion in annual sales, produce over 16 million tons of paper and be a leader in the growing consumer and corrugated packaging segments with increased diversification across paper and packaging products, markets and substrates. ", "KapStone will be integrated into our corrugated packaging segment, which will represent almost two-thirds of our overall business. The transaction is an excellent strategic fit for WestRock. First, the acquisition of KapStone will create opportunities for approximately $200 million in cost synergies and performance improvements. We do our homework upfront. We have a strong track record of delivering on our commitments across many transactions.", "Second, the acquisition strengthens WestRock\u2019s presence in the West Coast. KapStone will help us to better compete in the growing agricultural markets in the region and will bring our value delivery model to a whole new set of customers. Third, KapStone will broaden WestRock\u2019s portfolio of differentiated paper and packaging solutions with the addition of attractive paper grades and distribution capabilities.", "The addition of KapStone\u2019s heavyweight kraft products, which WestRock does not produce, are complementary and will further broaden our enterprisewide offerings enabling us to bring even more value to our current and prospective customers. Fourth, this transaction increases the mix of virgin fiber-based paper in WestRock\u2019s portfolio. KapStone\u2019s 3 million tons of paper is made using 78% virgin and 22% recovered fiber. This will bring WestRock\u2019s overall mix of virgin fiber from 65% to 67% and allow for more flexibility.", "Also the combined footprint will give us the ability to serve customers more efficiently. The transaction will enable us to bring our automated packaging solutions through [APS] and Box-On-Demand to the same expanded markets. This will benefit our customers through lower cost, increased sales, reduced risk and it will also help them meet their sustainability goals.", "And again, the acquisition will be immediately accretive to our adjusted EPS and cash flow. KapStone will add four mills that complement our current geographic footprint. In addition these mills will provide opportunities to further optimize our mill production and reduce both logistics and variable operating costs. The Longview mill gives us great logistical advantages with its strategic Northwest presence while the other mills integrate well into our existing system. The Charleston, Roanoke Rapids, and Cowpens mills are in great fiber baskets that we know well.", "The mills provide us with additional operational flexibility across our larger mill system. KapStone brings a complementary box plant system that enhances our national footprint. This will position WestRock to efficiently serve markets where we did not previously have a local presence and expand service to the Western agricultural market. With this extended geographic reach we believe there will be significant opportunity to realize economies in freight and logistics cost due to the integration of our West Coast box plant system with the Longview mill.", "I will turn it back to Ward to talk about some of the financial aspects of the transaction. Ward?", "Ward Dickson", "Thank you, Steve. We believe the acquisition will create significant sub-cost synergies and performance improvements. We have multiple initiatives to reduce cost across the mill and converting network from both process and capital investments, supply chain optimization and our ability to leverage our scale.", "In addition, there will be cost savings from the elimination of dual public company expenses. Finally, we will also be able to quickly integrate additional container board production into Victory\u2019s distribution network.", "We estimate total run rate synergies of approximately $200 million with approximately half of the synergies coming within the first 12 months. We have demonstrated that we can integrate acquisitions effectively and have a proven track record of delivering on the synergy and performance improvement goals.", "While our near-term capital allocation focus will shift to reducing leverage the transaction will not limit us from continuing to invest in our business. We expect leverage to quickly return to our targeted range by the end of fiscal 2019.", "I will turn it back to you Steve to wrap it up.", "Steve Voorhees", "Thanks Ward. The acquisition of KapStone aligns extremely well with our strategy. The addition of KapStone strengthens our North American corrugated packaging business. It provides meaningful synergy and performance improvement opportunities and it is very attractive financially. The acquisition builds on the positive momentum that we have in our corrugated packaging business that will accelerate our ability to reach our margin improvement objectives and meet our $4 billion adjusted EBITDA goal by 2022.", "The acquisition plays to our strengths and makes us a better company over the short and long-term. We remain focused on creating stockholder value. As we said before, we think about creating stockholder value as a three-step process. The first step is starting with the customer to provide a broad portfolio of paper and packaging solutions and we customize for the needs of our customers.", "This transaction improves our portfolio of paper and packaging solutions. Second, we execute well. This allows us to generate significant cash. This transaction provides us the opportunity to improve performance and execute well over an expanded corrugated packaging system. Third, with this transaction we are deploying our capital back into our business. The acquisition of KapStone Paper and Packaging will improve our business, grow our business and generate significant value for customers, employees and stockholders.", "James, would you now please give the instructions for opening up the line for Q&A.", "James Armstrong", "Thank you Steve. [Operator Instructions] Sharon, please open the call for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.", "Mark Weintraub", "Thank you. Congratulations. Obviously you have been busy as always. One of the questions \u2013 it is certainly everything strategically, financially looks good, the one question people often have had on KapStone is quality of assets, and therefore longer term capital needs. We are hoping to get your perspective on that question?", "Steve Voorhees", "Sure. I'm going to let Jeff answer that. He has been over to the mills recently with his team and has had the opportunity to review the operating records and meet with the key management. Jeff?", "Jeff Chalovich", "Good morning Mark. So, as Steve said, we have been through the mills. Went to the east recently, and have previously been through the Longview mill. So we are familiar with the asset quality, and there is really no surprises from what we have seen. We think from what we have seen we are able to manage those assets, invest appropriately through the mill system, and using performance excellence and capital allocation strategy improve the asset quality, the quality of the paper and we have a track record of being able to do that to take SP Fiber, [indiscernible] assets. We are going into a clear item. We are excited about the opportunity to integrate tons from the West Coast and really work that into our entire system. So we are excited about the opportunity. We plan to capital appropriately and we know how to do that.", "Mark Weintraub", "And so, Jeff, if you contrast the way their assets look relative to yours, would you say they are comparable, there are areas of clear opportunity to get them up to where yours are, or does it vary from asset to asset, any color you could give?", "Jeff Chalovich", "Sure. It varies from asset to asset, but if you take the Tacoma mill in the West, it is a good mill and well integrated for us, and what we have seen is we think we have the ability to bring the assets quality up to our standards, and we have a clear path that we see to do that.", "Mark Weintraub", "And one real quick one if I could, just on the containable price increase. Friday, IT announced KapStone also announced our unit position where you can tell us given I believe the guidance you gave on all the multiples et cetera presumably did not include another price increase.", "Just wanted to clarify that. I'm sure that's the case. But is there any color you can give us on what's going on contained about pricing?", "Ward Dickson", "As you know, we can't comment on future pricing. What I can comment on is the strength of our business. Our backlogs are strong, our market, our shipments were up 4%, last quarter 4% in January as Steve already said. Operating rates remain strong. As MPA reported 99% operating rates. Export markets are strong.", "So, and the economy, the backdrop of the economy is also strong. So, strong more can strong economy but can't comment on future pricing.", "Steve Voorhees", "And Mark, multiples we gave were on trailing basis to annualized six months or results.", "Mark Weintraub", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chip Dillon from Vertical Research. Your line is open.", "Chip Dillon", "Yes. Good morning and congratulations. First question is did I -- I just want to confirm that the guidance for this year does not include any incremental pricing increases in containerboard. And maybe I missed this but Steve did you say that the 2022 target EBITDA was moved up from the 3.8 because of this spill or maybe I misunderstood that?", "Steve Voorhees", "No. the target we gave on Investor Day was $4 million, there is no change in that. I mean, what we respond.", "Ward Dickson", "And our the reaffirmation of our full-year guidance reflects our current view of inflationary items but only assumes pricing for previously published price increases across both our corrugated and consumer business. And so, we are our current view is that we can maintain that EBITDA guidance for the full-year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Your line is open.", "Anthony Pettinari", "Good morning.", "Steve Voorhees", "Good morning.", "Anthony Pettinari", "Just following-up on Mark's question on asset quality. I think for a number of years you've had a goal of increasing your Ford integration rate. I think KapStone had a kind of a lower integration rate.", "Just wondering, in terms of timeline for reaching I think the 80% target that you've laid out, how the acquisition potentially impacts that?", "Jeff Chalovich", "Hi Anthony, good morning, it's Jeff. We finished this quarter at 77% integration with the KapStone acquisition. We'll be in the low-to-mid 70 still. The integration targets' not a hard and fast number, as we said we'll continue to drive to the 80%. And that's really again the option now that we continue to address the tails of our channels and we like the optionality we have between the channels.", "And we will continue to do that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "George Staphos", "Good morning, everybody. Welcome, James. Good luck with the transaction. Thanks for all the details. My question is a little bit of a two-part question. In total, Jeff and Steve, what how will maybe you know KapStone impact the way you run the business. Specifically, what key process and systems and data opportunities you would in KapStone, that's obviously been a big piece of the WestRock story over the last number of years.", "And then, in that regard and in terms of how you evaluate business and run your business, does the potential KapStone acquisition change at all, how you'd look at the algorithm for pricing at containerboard, not trying to get into future pricing but if the market and all the other things that go into the algorithm are as they are, would KapStone affect that all your choices for future pricing? Thank you.", "Jeff Chalovich", "Hi George, this is Jeff. To start with your first question, the way we run the business is the same. We're at much different corrugated business today than when we acquired some more from Stone. The KapStone assets fit nicely into the regions that we already have established.", "So, our management teams have come through the Smurfit acquisition, they've done multiple integrations. Their operating platform is a mixture of QIWI and Ametek. Those are the systems we run. We'll fully implement the QIWI system through the plans that we same thing we did in the Smurfit assets. We have a good way to do that, a good data management system.", "Our performance excellence programs, commercial excellence programs be rolled out through the plans the same way we do. In the regions as they fit today, East Central in West regions. So, we have the management teams in the areas already set up. We have to scale to integrate these quickly and integrate them well.", "And a very good training program with technical resources to be able to implement the systems and processes. So, we won't change the way we go to market and the way we manage the business. And the acquisition also provides a great growth area for us where we don\u2019t compete in some of the local markets in the West.", "So, we like the mix of business that's really regional and local. And it gives us some scale on the West where we don\u2019t currently compete and puts us in the new markets. It also gives us some opportunity to scale our automation platform.", "So, our \"Box on Demand\" recent acquisition on our APS programs, we really have a new area in markets to be able to leverage that platform which will continue to do in the Northwest, their AG platform is very solid. So, that gives us a chance to integrate our machinery business through the markets.", "And then, there is good synergies where we have complementary markets in areas that we need to be able to grow that we were capacity constrained. These assets give us a tremendous opportunity to grow where we haven\u2019t with the systems and processes we already have in place.", "On the second point. I'm going to comment, it's been a long time. So, I can't really speak to algorithms and the pricing and make forward comments on the pricing. I know you want to get into the pricing discussion, George.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Adam Josephson from KeyBanc. Your line is open.", "Adam Josephson", "Hey Ward, John, congratulations and best of luck on the transaction. Steve, one question comparing these assets and this business to Smurfit. How would you compare the quality of the assets of KapStone to Smurfit as well as how you expect the integration to be similar or different? Thank you.", "Steve Voorhees", "That is a totally different situation. If we recall, I mean, Rock-Tenn at the time was a $3 billion company and Smurfit took us to $10 billion. And it, I'll just tell you it was a challenge to take all that on and we did it. And if you recall that frankly retain the Smurfit management team for about a year.", "And then we changed management teams in the corrugated packaging business to the current management team which is led by Jeff Chalovich and Tom Stigers and I think a very talented group of people. And over the past five or six years, I think they have very deliberately developed a just an outstanding business.", "We have installed QIWI virtually across the entire system. We have installed a new management system that allow us to manage the processes. And so, in that context, I think Jeff went through how KapStone fits into our business and where they really fits very snugly into our business.", "So, the integration challenges, the asset quality challenges, and all of the challenges are much easier to address than Smurfit. I think it's just two different situations.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Connelly from Stephens. Your line is open.", "Mark Connelly", "Steve, the containerboard now are going to be more than 2/3rds of the business. Do you think it's important to continue to expand the consumer to make that more relevant or are you comfortable letting consumer contribution continue to drop?", "Steve Voorhees", "And so, consumers contributions' the same as it was last week. And on consumer we've got a great business which is very complementary to our entire business. And we're going to continue to look at opportunities across our entire business. Part of the reason for the merger was to create long-term opportunities for us to invest and then build our business.", "And that remains as true today, last week.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steve Chercover from Davidson. Your line is open.", "Steven Chercover", "Thanks, good morning everyone. First, it seems like Victory was an opportunity to place boxes for KapStone but their geographic fit and maybe their financial effects inevitably didn\u2019t allow them to really leverage it. Does your footprint allow you to fill that really rapidly?", "Steve Voorhees", "It does, I'll let Jeff expand on that.", "Jeff Chalovich", "Good morning, Steve. And you have a good question. It does. We're a supplier currently to Victory. We have been for over 20 years, we know their business well. And it's a chance for us to forward integrate across the larger platform. When we had the plants in the same areas, I think KapStone was a little bit of a disadvantage for their plant locations.", "We will quickly integrate business across the platform for Victory.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Scott Gaffner from Barclays. Your line is open.", "Scott Gaffner", "Thanks. Good morning and congratulations.", "Steve Voorhees", "Thank you.", "Scott Gaffner", "My question was just is really strictly around the timing of the acquisition and sort of what drove the decision making process sort of what line out, because if I look at it, right, it's a 35% premium to last night\u2019s close but 60% premium to where the stock traded over the last seven months of 2017.", "So, was there some strategic push that made it now that the best time or maybe you can help us out with that a little bit? Thanks.", "Steve Voorhees", "Thanks for the question. I've been really visiting and so we announced the merger three years ago. We spun off in jeopardy, we sold HHB and made a handful of acquisitions last year, including MPS.", "I'm sorry, think just now is a good time from that standpoint. I think corrugated packaging business has been improving and specifically our corrugated packaging business has been improving. I think we have the capability to take those on in a way organizationally that we just didn\u2019t have even six months or a year ago.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Lars Kjellberg from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Lars Kjellberg", "Thank you. Just a question on capital allocation. Ward, you mentioned that the focus will shift towards deleveraging. How should we put that into context of this one position and if you can put any color on the incremental CapEx need required to capture those 200 million in synergies.", "And if you take delaying any that the major CapEx projects to be able to capture this 200 million versus the prior scenario?", "Ward Dickson", "Thanks, Lars. I believe this fits quite well into our capital allocation priorities. So, depending upon the timing of the close, our initial leverage will be above three times. But with the ongoing cash flow generation of both our business and the KapStone business and the achievement of the initial synergies, we believe that we will fall back into our targeted range by the end of fiscal 2019.", "The capital that we are planning is roughly a $140 million to a $150 million a year CapEx. That's their base CapEx plus any return generating capital that we need to include to capture the synergies. And we will, as we said, we will focus our short-term capital allocation priorities to return leverage in our targeted range but it will not prevent us from proceeding on the strategic capital projects that we've already announced.", "And it's a testament to the strong cash flow generation that we have across our business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Wilde from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Mark Wilde", "Good morning. I think you guys are pretty familiar with that long view mill. You spend a lot of talk over time about potentially leveraging a lot of excess kind of holding capacity of that mill. Can you just talk about the potential for that and whether these recent changes and the tax code might make that more attractive over the next few years?", "Jeff Chalovich", "Hey Mark, good morning, it's Jeff. So, we are familiar with the mill. I think it's too early to say what we'll do with the assets completely. We're familiar with the capacity for the pulping. It's not, I don\u2019t think it's a simple change. But it's too early to say categorically what the opportunity is there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo Security. Your line is open.", "Chris Manuel", "Good morning, gentlemen and congratulations on this accomplishment. Quite significant, I think it'd be quite helpful. A couple, one question for every couple of parts to you. First, can you talk to us a little bit about expectations through the first half of the year or how you see some OCC stuff playing out in the market?", "And then, the second part was by our math, if we continue to grow at and you talked about 4% in the first half of the year, I'm sorry, 4% through January for corrugated. The market can be pretty tight and it seems to us as coming into this being a large export player, that's going to have to get throttled back quite a bit.", "How do you balance that at least through the first half of the year between pulling back into next board and you still think you'll have enough to serve some of your strategic customers down, example Mexico and that kind of stuff?", "Jeff Chalovich", "Sure. Hey Chris, this is Jeff. So, I'll start with the OCC. As you probably read, there has been 1.1 million licenses issued recently. So, it's we see it's been down a bit and if you look at our forecast hasn\u2019t changed considerably. There'll be tons hitting China here in the future.", "So, it's early to call what will happen with the quality requirements still at 0.5% and the license is being issued. So, we're not clear that it's going to stay so good through the first half of the year.", "On the second part, tell me your second part of the question again, please, go on.", "Steve Voorhees", "It was on the export.", "Jeff Chalovich", "The export. So, we have pulled packaging now as we continue to manage the tails of our business. We are supplying our strategic customers. And again, we have optionality to the tails. So, if we have opportunities in domestic, we'll export that seem better than the box channel.", "We'll take those opportunities and we've done that. So, we'll continue to service our strategic customers and we'll continue to manage the tails. Where we can make the most money on our products, we'll sell them into those channels.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brian Maguire from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Brian Maguire", "And thank you. And my congratulations on the deal. And welcome James to the team. Just a question on the synergies. The target there, it looks like it's a little over 6% of KapStone sales. Actually a little bit high based on some of the recent deals you've done. Just, I know you guys have done your homework on it but just wondering what gives you some confidence that you can exceed a little bit of a higher synergy target than you have on some of the prior yield.", "Ward Dickson", "This is Ward. I think Jeff has articulated how it just fits extremely well into our network. So, a large component of the synergies is our ability to optimize the supply chain and improve the pairings between mills and external customers and box plans and external customers and our internal supply chain.", "We also have seen that we have opportunities to leverage WestRock's scale from procurement point-of-view. Fiber procurement and other commodity procurement. So, this deal, every deal is unique in terms of its complementary nature to our existing network and this fits so well into our both our mill and converting systems that it gives us tremendous confidence that we can achieve the targets.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "George Staphos", "Hi, just a quick one to finish up. Thanks for taking my follow-on. I just want to verify the synergy targets that you provided both the end goal of 200 million including performance improvements and the half by the end of fiscal '19. Those are run-rate targets, correct?", "And then, as we look at the slices of the pie, and I think its slide 18. Can you give us a little bit more color in terms of what you're doing on the mill side, both in terms of the process improvement and network optimization as well as the performance improvements? Thank you.", "Steve Voorhees", "George, I'll take the first piece of that and then I'll have Jeff add to it. So, it is run rate, run the $200 million goal is a run-rate goal and the achievement of half of it in the first full fiscal year, is again our root run-rate goal. I'll reiterate some of the comments that I just made about the ability to for us to optimize the supply chain to reduce logistics cost as we match mills and box plans with customer pairings and optimize the supply chain and to the straight logistics.", "I'll have Jeff talk about the further opportunities in the mill and converting network.", "Jeff Chalovich", "Hi, George. So, the blue part of the charts are made up of fiber procurement opportunities. So, optimizing fiber purchasing. Energy cost improvements across the system. There's a large opportunity to implement our ePay and maintenance system. So, we see great opportunities across the mill system to do that.", "General productivity improvements to our Lean Six Sigma technicians and then also some CapEx related projects that we see opportunities for. So, that's the major part of that, slice of the pi.", "Steve Voorhees", "So George, I'm on a --.", "George Staphos", "Thank you.", "Steve Voorhees", "So George, it's just one of the great things about Smurfit is their system was there most of them was relatively complex from a papermaking standpoint including trauma mixed delays. And so, we took it on ourselves to invest in technology that allows us to dispatch our mill system in an extremely efficient way.", "And we've been able to use that to pro forma the KapStone mill system. That gives us a lot of confidence in the, I'm going to say the word \"Justifiable supply chain integration\" and that portion of these synergies and the forms and bring them.", "George Staphos", "Thank you, very much. Good luck.", "Operator", "Your next question that comes from Paul Quinn from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Paul Quinn", "Thanks very much and congratulations, I like the fit. Just a question on we talked about containerboard, we talked about Victory, just on kraft paper, KapStone has got about a million tons. How do you like that business and especially around the export market and what are you going to do different than KapStone's in there?", "Jeff Chalovich", "Hi Paul, it's Jeff. So, we do like that business, it's complementary to what we have. So, the heavier weight Multiwall and also kraft bag puts us in to markets where we don\u2019t have. And with the kraft bag market, in favor as you look at plastics being banned, we think that's a good opportunity for us.", "And so, we're going to, we'll learn more and more about it as we get into it certainly, since we're just signed last night. But overall we like that market in that segment. And it's complementary to a one we already have.", "Paul Quinn", "Excellent. Thanks a lot.", "Jeff Chalovich", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Scott Gaffner from Barclays. Your line is open.", "Scott Gaffner", "Taking a follow-up. Just two quick ones. One, on the synergies. When I look at the number, actually looks relatively conservative to me because if I look back just when you did Smurfit-stone, you significantly overachieved your initial goal and even the initial goal was as a percentage of revenue was higher than what you've outlined here.", "So, can you maybe talk about your view on conservatism verses aggressiveness on the synergies? And then just, one thing that hasn\u2019t been hid on here on the call is just the regulatory hurdles. Can you talk about any approval that you might need outside of the U.S. thanks.", "Steve Voorhees", "Okay. So, just we have $200 million, that's the number we're presenting. And we'll comment on whether it's conservative or not after we have $200 million. We think it's a great opportunity, we have complementary businesses. With respect to regulatory clearance and addition to the U.S. we'll need it in Mexico, Austria and Germany.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Wilde from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Mark Wilde", "I'm just curious, KapStone has had a pretty bumpy last four five quarters. They seem to have done a whole lot better based on the guidance this morning in the fourth calendar quarter. But what gives you guy's confidence that these issues are really behind them at this point?", "Ward Dickson", "Hi, Mark. Aside from what we've seen the past that they've laid out, is solid. I think they have been executing better and what I have comprehended is our ability to manage that system based on our history and our results of running the business.", "So, what I'm confident of mostly is our management team and how we can execute and how this fits well into our system in the upside we have with managing the KapStone system.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chip Dillon from Vertical Research. Your line is open.", "Chip Dillon", "Yes. Thanks for taking my follow-up. This is more for Ward. What kind of step-up would be a good number to use? I know Smurfit, I'm sorry, KapStone's DD&A was around 180. And with 220 bigger place to go and just a cut to the chase, it seems like if we assume about a 4% interest rate and that so right depreciation, I'm getting like $0.25 accretion without synergies and $0.85 with synergy.", "Ward Dickson", "As we get closer to the close with there are -- they're run rated as you said of DD&A's about between a $185 million and a $190 million. We estimated right now that it's going to be our initial estimates a $100 million higher than that.", "Chip Dillon", "Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo Security. Your line is open.", "Chris Manuel", "Good morning. Just two quick follow-ups. First to go back to the OCC environment. What you had an old assumption at your Analyst Day and the primary service it was about 140, 150. What is the new assumption for this year? And then I'd have a second follow-up.", "Ward Dickson", "This is Ward. What we did provide was a 140 average for the full-year and right now our current estimate is approximately $10 below that for the full-year.", "Chris Manuel", "Okay. So, that's is what's based in the rest of your guidance. That's perfect, thank you. And then in the second follow-up. The follow-up question is with regards to the KapStone transaction, walk us through a little bit of the process here. So, is there do you anticipate any regulatory issues maybe with a look at mills on the West Coast, since there is a little bit concentration and that type of stuff.", "Is there any sort of a provision that either you can walk if there are material divestitures or things to that nature. What's the or can anything there you can tell us would be helpful.", "Steve Voorhees", "And we'll be making a regulatory filings shortly. We don\u2019t believe the transaction rates is any serious concerns and add the jurisdictions for which we need to receive regulatory clearance. Like our businesses are very complementary, owing that enhances our presence on the West Coast and the heavy weight kraft paper products.", "They produce the products that we don\u2019t produce. And importantly, the acquisition will expand and improve the efficiencies of our mill and box plant system and we quantify that with the $200 million and cost synergies and performs improvements.", "Chris Manuel", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Adam Josephson from KeyBanc. Your line is open.", "Adam Josephson", "Thanks. Steve, just one on your grade mix. So, obviously with the Mead merger, you got much bigger in box board and you got bigger yet in box board last year with multi-packaging. And now you're going back toward containerboard is getting into kraft paper to a significant extent.", "So, is there any kind of strategic comparative to be bigger in one particular grade and if so, why?", "Steve Voorhees", "There's not a strategic imperative be bigger in one particular grade. We're a paper and packaging company and I think the a lot of people look at the business between consumer and corrugated. But algorithm is highly related and complementary and one enhances the other.", "We have many customers that buy both from a manufacturing standpoint. Paper mill doesn't much certainly know what grades its making. It take fiber and turn into paper and our converting process have great commonality as well. So, IPO is also a paper and packaging company and will continue to look at opportunities across our business, across our grades as we've been doing for the past several years.", "Adam Josephson", "Nice, Steve.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.", "Mark Weintraub", "Thank you. I just wanted to make sure on the tax rate for KapStone, is there any reason why we wouldn\u2019t be expecting to see similar types of decline versus what's been seen historically as to what you've laid out for yourself from 10% or 11% decline in the effective tax rate. Is that a good starting point?", "Ward Dickson", "I will let KapStone publish their disclosure for the end of the year to clarify that for you. But the clearly their business even as compares to ours has a higher U.S. mix. So, in terms of earnings mix across the globe. So, they will clearly have meaningful benefits with the rate production -- the several rate production.", "Mark Weintraub", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "At this time, we have no further questions.", "Jeff Chalovich", "Thank you, Sherrin. And thank you to our audience for your time this morning. We appreciate your interest in WestRock. If you have any questions following this call, the Investor Relations team is happy to help you.
