(ZMH) Q3 2014 Results Earnings Conference Call October 23, 2014  8:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Bob Marshall - VP of IR", "David Dvorak - CEO", "Jim Crines - CFO", "Analysts", "Bob Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "Matt Taylor - Barclays Capital", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company", "David Lewis - Morgan Stanley", "Operator", "", "Good morning. I would like to turn the call over to Bob Marshall, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer.", "Mr. Marshall, you may begin your call.", "Bob Marshall", "Thank you, Britney and good morning everyone. Welcome to Zimmer's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. I'm here with our CEO, David Dvorak and our CFO, Jim Crines.", "Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties. Also, the discussions during this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included within the earnings release, which is available on our website at investor.zimmer.com.", "With that, I'll now turn the call over to David.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call for the third quarter of 2014. This morning, I'll review our third quarter financial results, providing commentary on the year's progress to date and highlights from our performance. Jim will then provide additional financial details. I'll state all sales in constant currency terms and all earnings results on an adjusted basis.", "Zimmer drove solid topline growth across several key product categories and geographies in the third quarter notably, accelerating U.S. knee sales over a strong performance in the prior year.", "Consolidated net sales for the quarter were $1.11 billion, an increase of 3.1% and our earnings per share were $1.35, an increase of 8% over the prior year period. In the third quarter, Americas sales grew by 1% year-over-year, while Europe, Middle East and Africa increased by 5.7%, and the Asia Pacific region grew 6.9%.", "These results reflect focused execution amid a stable global market for musculoskeletal solutions, with some modest acceleration in certain geographies.", "With respect to pricing, we experienced price pressure of negative 2.2% in the third quarter, increased global market penetration of new products, positive long-term clinical validations of our legacy products in key international markets and the natural cycle of contract renewals and renegotiation in the United States all contributed to a sequential improvement and negative price trends by 60 basis points and thanks to the ongoing success of our operational excellence initiatives in the quarter, we once again expanded operating margins and accelerated earnings growth.", "We also made progress with integrations planning for our pending combination with Biomet. We continue to be excited about the compelling strategic and financial rational, underlying this combination.", "In addition to commercial and operational synergies, our combined entity will posses enhanced capabilities and resources for research and development, allowing us to more rapidly and efficiently bring a broad portfolio of musculoskeletal products, technologies and services to market.", "We remain focused on integration planning efforts around the transaction, which we expect to close in the first quarter of 2015.", "Turning now to our product categories, Knee sales for the third quarter increased 6.3%, which we believe was an above-market performance, reflecting positive volume and mix of 9.2% and negative price of 2.9%.", "Our Americas segment reported a sales increase of 5.7%, while Europe, Middle East and Africa grew by 9.8% and the Asia Pacific region delivered 3.8% growth compared to the prior year period.", "Throughout the quarter, our focused execution drove solid sales of our next gen knee replacement system in European markets and supported the achievement of milestone sales for Persona, the personalized knee system, which has now surpassed the total of 100,000 implantations since its commercial introduction.", "As we've communicated in previous quarters, the Persona system offers unprecedented level of anatomic fidelity and next generation features and is supported by Zimmer's intelligent instrumentation systems, including patient-specific instruments, the iASSIST Personalized Guidance System and the eLIBRA Dynamic Knee Balancing System.", "We also continue to be excited about the steady growth of our joint preservation portfolio, including our single injection Gel-One Cross-linked Hyaluronate treatment and the Knee Creations' Subchondroplasty procedure.", "Earlier this month, we strengthened this growing biologics portfolio of differentiated treatments early joint disease through the acquisition of Cambridge Massachusetts-based ETEX Holdings, Incorporated and its innovative line of solutions.", "Zimmer's hip business recorded a sales increase of 2.7%, reflecting positive volume and mix of 5.2% and negative price of 2.5%. These results include a 0.2% sales decrease in the Americas; a sales increase of 2.8% in Europe, Middle East and Africa; and an impressive 9.7% increase in the Asia Pacific region.", "We continue to position a comprehensive hip portfolio, for long-term growth opportunities and in the quarter, we achieved above market performances in several key overseas markets.", "Global sales were led by premium solutions such as our Continuum Acetabular System and BIOLOX delta Ceramic head offering. We also delivered steady growth in the Americas with our M/L Taper and TM Primary Stems as well as the Avenir M\u00fcller Hip Stem in the European markets.", "Our legacy hip portfolio continues to demonstrate excellent performance as evidenced by an impressive level of clinical and scientific validation. Zimmer continues to achieve favorable ratings by the United Kingdom's Orthopedic Data Evaluation panel with 10 of our major hip brands having now obtained a Class A 10-year rating.", "Additionally, in ongoing extensive laboratory testing, Zimmer's Vivacit-E Vitamin E Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene liners have been evaluated for more than 90 million cycles of wear testing. We believe this to be the first and only hip replacement technology to demonstrate long-term wear resistance, surpassing the number of walking steps a patient will typically take during their life time following total hip replacement surgery.", "Turning to extremities, Zimmer recorded a sales increase of 2.5% in the third quarter. Competitive pressure continue to present a headwind for our shoulder business in the U.S., which somewhat offset our double-digit growth in the Europe, Middle East and Africa and Asia Pacific regions.", "We'll continue leveraging our differentiated shoulder portfolio including the Trabecular Metal Reverse Shoulder and the Patient Specific Instrument shoulder system and innovative surgical platform that further enhances our position in this rapidly growing segment of the shoulder arthroplasty market.", "We'll also continue to drive sales contributions from our more recently introduced products in our extremities portfolio such as the Trabecular Metal Total Ankle system and the Nexel Total Elbow, both of which feature advanced proprietary bearing technologies.", "Zimmer dental sales decreased by 2% in the third quarter. Our stabilizing performance in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region was offset by challenging year-over-year sales comparisons for our Asia-Pacific business and regenerative portfolio.", "We expect that these headwinds in the quarter will normalize in future operating periods and will continue to focus on leveraging our comprehensive dental portfolio for improved growth.", "Zimmer trauma sales decreased 0.6% in the third quarter with an impressive 9.4% sales increase in the Asia Pacific region, offset by a 5.5% sales decrease in the Americas and a 0.7% decline in Europe, Middle East and Africa.", "Although we faced challenge in prior year comparisons in Europe, Middle East and Africa, we continue to achieve encouraging growth in the Asia Pacific region and steady adoption of our core offerings, including rising sales of the Zimmer Natural Nail family.", "In building on the recent launch of the Distal Radius Plating System in the United States, in the third quarter we introduced this versatile fracture system in certain European markets. We intend to position our differentiated trauma offerings for improved growth in the future as we continue expanding our footprint in major trauma centers around the globe.", "Zimmer spine delivered 6.4% sales growth over the prior year, which we believe is an above market performance. The growth of this global business continues to validate our efforts and focus on core fusion solutions.", "As we execute on an innovative and increasingly competitive spine portfolio, released in the second quarter of 2014, the Virage OCT spinal fixation system has already succeeded in expanding our footprint in posterior fixation surgeries, while supporting volume and mix growth for other Zimmer spine products used in the same procedures.", "We've also been pleased with the ongoing commercialization of the Optio-C interior cervical system. Our next generation modular cervical device, which in the third quarter received an additional 510-K clearance from the FDA for its allograft application.", "Sales for Zimmer's surgical and other category decreased by 4.4% in the quarter. We continue to face challenging sales comparisons in the U.S. stemming from the exceptional performance in capital sales of our differentiated Transposal fluid waste management system in the prior year.", "However, we drove noteworthy sales across a number of major product lines, including consumable and wound debridement products as well as skin graft solutions.", "We also continue to achieve healthy growth in capital sales of the A.T.S. family of Automatic Tourniquet Systems, which feature advanced proprietary pressure sensing technology designed to achieve higher levels of safety, reliability and convenience.", "We look forward to continuing to drive this differentiated portfolio for growth in future quarters.", "With that, I'll now ask Jim to provide further details on the third quarter and our guidance. Jim?", "Jim Crines", "Thank you, David. I will review our third quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our updated 2014 sales and earnings guidance.", "Before I start, I would like to note that our results reflect the same number of billing days in the current year quarters than the prior year. Our total revenues for the third quarter were $1,106,000,000, a 3.1% constant currency increase compared to the third quarter of 2013.", "Net currency impact for the quarter decreased revenues by 0.2% or $2 million. The negative currency impact for the quarter related principally to our Japanese yen-denominated revenues, partially offset by positive currency translation associated with our euro-based revenues.", "Our adjusted gross profit margin was 73.4% for the quarter. The margin ratio declined 10 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2013. In the third quarter, we recognized approximately 80 basis points of charges related to the medical device excise tax.", "This headwind, along with ongoing but more moderate price pressure was effectively offset by manufacturing efficiencies, as well as modest incremental gains from our cash flow hedging program and reduced year-over-year excess and obsolescence changes.", "The company's R&D expense decreased 6.7% or $3.3 million to 4.2% of net sales when compared to the prior year. The decrease in R&D expense continues to reflect focused efforts on our quality and operational excellence initiatives and related dedication of resources.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses were $443.5 million in the third quarter and at 40.1% of sales, were 70 basis points below the prior year. The continuous improvement in this ratio reflects our ongoing commitment to administrative and operational excellence.", "Our global strategic sourcing initiative as well as go-to-market and distribution optimization efforts continue to drive improved productivity and year-over-year savings in certain spend categories.", "In the quarter, the company reported pretax charges of $66.9 million in special items; $3.8 million in cost of products sold pertaining to global restructuring, quality and operational excellence initiatives and recent acquisitions; and $10.5 million of interest and upfront financing cost associated with the pending Biomet transaction.", "Adjusted third quarter 2014 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these charges. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to $321.9 million or 29.1%. Our adjusted operating profit-to-sales ratio was 100 basis points higher than the prior year third quarter.", "The continued expansion of operating margin demonstrates the organization's commitment to create value through the achievement of operational efficiency goals along with the growth and capital allocation dimensions embedded within our value creation framework.", "Net interest expense for the quarter amounted to $13.3 million, which was flat when compared to the prior year quarter. Adjusted net earnings were $232.6 million for the third quarter, an increase of 7.8% compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $1.35 on a 171.7 million average outstanding diluted shares.", "These adjusted earnings per share are inclusive of approximately $0.05 of share-based compensation. At $0.96, reported diluted earnings per share increased 6.7% from the prior year third quarter reported EPS of $0.90.", "Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.7%, which is 70 basis points favorable when compared to the prior year due to a favorable change in estimate associated with certain income tax returns that were finalized in the quarter.", "Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.3%, due mainly to certain non-deductible expenses connected with the pending Biomet merger. The company had approximately 169.3 million shares of common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2014, a decrease compared to the 170.5 million as of September 30, 2013.", "Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $255.7 million, a decrease of 12.6% from $292.7 million in the third quarter of 2013. The decrease was driven primarily by higher tax payments relative to the same period prior year as well as increased inventory investments in support of higher field consignments in global new product launches.", "Net inventories were $1.2 billion at the end of the third quarter, an increase of $30.3 million from June 30, 2014. As I just noted, the increase is connected with the ongoing global commercialization of new product offerings, as well as the effects of placing more inventory into distributor and hospital consignments.", "Adjusted inventory days on hand finished the quarter at 348 days as compared to 284 days at the prior year quarter end. As of the end of the third quarter, net receivables increased to $947.6 million from $898.9 million in the third quarter of 2013 or 5% above the prior year.", "Our adjusted traded accounts receivable days sales outstanding finished the quarter at 71 days, two days improved when compared with the prior year. Depreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter amounted to $90.9 million.", "Free cash flow in the third quarter was $172.5 million, $33.5 million lower than the third quarter of 2013. We define free cash flow as operating cash flow less cash outlays for instruments and property, plant and equipment.", "The decrease in free cash flow was driven by decreased operating cash flows, as I've just noted as well as increased instrument investments in support of the ongoing launch of new products. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $83.2 million, including $50.9 million for instruments and $32.3 million for property, plant and equipment.", "I'd like to turn now to our guidance for 2014. In our earnings release this morning, we updated the company's expectation for 2014 revenues and now forecast revenues to increase approximately 2.25% constant currency when compared to 2013.", "We now expect foreign currency translation to decrease our reported 2014 revenues by approximately 0.75% for the full year. Therefore, on a reported basis, our revenues are projected to be approximately 1.5% above 2013 results.", "As we anniversary through the recognition of medical device excise tax during the fourth quarter, coupled with ongoing savings from our operational excellence programs we would expect the gross margin ratio for the year to remain between 73% and 74%. Our guidance for R&D, SG&A and interest expense for the full year also remains unchanged.", "However, as you refine your models for the fourth quarters, please consider the seasonally lower expense ratios typically experienced in the fourth quarter. Moving down the income statement, the estimated full year tax rate is now between 25% and 25.5%.", "The previously guided fully diluted share count of 172 million shares to 173 million shares is more likely to be toward the lower end of that range as exercises some employee stock option are lower. In the fourth quarter, we would expect fully diluted shares to be just above 172 million shares.", "Full year 2014 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance has been updated to approximately $6.05, taking into account our updated expectations for full year revenue growth.", "As indicated in our earnings release, to arrive at our anticipated reported GAAP earnings per share, you should subtract total charges for special items and certain claims of $250 million and $70 million of Biomet transaction-related expenses on a pretax basis or approximately $1.40 per share.", "Before I finish, I would like to make a few modeling comments relating to our proposed combination with Biomet. I want to reiterate that the previously announced guidance regarding accretion and adjusted cash earnings per share applies to the first 12 months following the closing of the deal.", "With that in mind, we continue to expect accretion and adjusted cash earnings per share to be $1.15 and $1.25 on approximately 207 million fully diluted shares.", "To arrive at this fully diluted share count, and the 32.7 million shares comprising the equity portion of the consideration for the deal through our projected pending diluted share count of approximately 173 million as well an additional 1.3 million shares anticipated to the issue pursuant to our employee equity programs.", "Finally, please note that our guidance does not include any impact from any unforeseen events.", "David, I'll turn the call back over to you.", "David Dvorak", "Thanks, Jim. Zimmer's third quarter was highlighted by solid sales across key products and geographies. Our performance continues to be driven by innovative systems such as the Persona need, which incorporates premium technologies that we leverage across our differentiated portfolio, including Trabecular Metal technology in the Vivacit advanced bearing material.", "For the balance of 2014 we'll be committing significant energy to the ongoing integration planning for our pending combination with Biomet, while continuing to deliver a compelling value proposition, the patients providers and healthcare institutions in the 45 billion musculoskeletal market.", "And now I'd like to ask Britney to begin the Q&A portion of our call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi guys, it's actually Craig on for Larry.", "David Dvorak", "Hello Craig.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Just I guess, I'll start with the implied -- the implied growth by my math is about 2% in Q4 and I just wanted to know and it seems like a bit of a slowdown, especially some of the -- given some of the acceleration you saw in re-con and then some of the seasonality trends that we expect.", "So I just wanted to know what headwinds or what factors make that number seems conservative to us at least?", "David Dvorak", "Well I think that you point out the seasonality trends and I think that's the thing to focus on. We wouldn\u2019t expect our performance to fall off relative to the market and these categories the positive trends will continue by product category and by geography and we look to continue to improve the sales execution in the Americas in particular.", "But as you reflect back on the fourth quarter of 2013, it was a pretty significant procedural shift into their quarter and that really was the area that one has to be careful about as we look to project Q4 market growth rates within the United States on the large joint side in particular.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thanks. And if I can as a follow-up just ask on pricing, obviously you guys -- pricing improved during the quarter and I appreciate the color on some of the timing of contracts, but other competitors have seen pricing pressure increased during the quarter and throughout the year. So I just wanted to get your sense of how we should look, how we should look at that going forward?", "Jim Crines", "Sure Larry, this is Jim.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Craig.", "Jim Crines", "Craig, sorry.", "Unidentified Analyst", "We have a problem.", "Jim Crines", "Yes, yes. First of all we're really pleased with the sequential 60 basis point improvement in negative price in the quarter. We continue to believe our commercial teams are doing a good job with managing the pressure.", "As David indicated, there are a number of factors contributing to the [rate] (ph) we saw in the trend. As an example, as we establish higher market penetration with new products, including most importantly the Persona knee system, we tend to see more stability in prices because these new platforms are being introduced with tighter price bands compared with our more established legacy products.", "As you know we're operating in a market environment that does not allow for the kind of variations we might have experienced in the past.", "With regard to contract renewals, we have had to deal with our fair share of demand letters from our U.S. based hospital customers. In our case the total value of price concessions by quarter across all contract renewals has come down sequentially from one quarter to the next beginning with the second quarter.", "Now we may see an increase in demand letters in coming quarters, we certainly expect price pressure is going to continue in this market, but still a positive trend in this quarter and one we believe is helped by increased market penetration of new products.", "And then lastly, I would just point out that we saw improvement in all geographic segments in the quarter as compared with the second quarter and in this context, we believe the continued positive long-term clinical validation supporting our legacy products, which is demonstrated in registry data, is helping us in key international markets.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. Thanks guys.", "David Dvorak", "You're welcome, Craig.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with BofA Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Bob Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Thanks and good morning.", "David Dvorak", "Good morning.", "Bob Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch", "So, on the Biomet transaction, thanks for the detail, I just wanted to ask two things. First sort of qualitatively I was wondering David, if you could comment on how the integration is going generally or how the early part of the integration is going generally?", "Are you having good conversations with the distributors? Just your confidence level and then may be Jim more quantitatively I appreciate your comments on the synergies and the share count and frankly that's the kind of thing that I think a lot of people are modeling and as I see the street consensus for 2015 on a cash basis, assuming that Biomet closes in Q1, is in the high $7 area, $7.80, $7.85 somewhere in that range.", "And I was just wondering if you could comment on is that a number that you are -- is that a range that you're relatively comfortable with at this point, given the -- given what you're seeing in the business today.", "David Dvorak", "I'll pick up with the first part of your question Bob. This is David. We're very, very pleased with the integration planning as it relates to the combination. I'll tell you that the chemistry of the Group has been terrific. The energy level has been extremely high.", "We've had opportunities and part of this is enhanced by the sort of the co-location benefit of the headquarters, but I would tell you globally leaders have set a very good tone, a very constructive tone of the integration planning work and that's cascaded down as these teams have expanded.", "At all levels of the organization I think that part of that is just a credit to the leadership and the Biomet leaders in particular, I want to applaud their efforts. It's very commendable the approaches they take, but I would tell you that the other element of it that one can't fake at some level, is just the underpinnings and premises for the deal are unmistakable to folks as they get into the planning and look at the benefits of combining these portfolios, combining the R&D efforts, the strength of the combined distribution channels and on and on, one can clearly see that this is going to be a leadership position that can make a big difference for all stakeholders involved.", "And that is establishing the positive tone in combination with the approach that the leaders are taking. So we're right on track if not ahead of the planning efforts relative to what we were anticipating or looking to achieve going back to the announcement date in April and on the distribution side in particular, that you referenced/", "I think that's not really well because at the sales level they can see the benefits of the combined portfolios and they can understand the logic to the combined R&D efforts and what a difference that can make in the environment that we're going to be operating in and the differentiated opportunity that we're going to have to provide better solutions to enhance patient outcomes and to do that in an increasingly cost efficient for the customers and help shape how those solutions are delivered to the marketplace.", "So all is on track if not ahead of schedule and then I would tell you that the tone and the attitudes are even more positive than what I had hoped for.", "Jim Crines", "And Bob, this is Jim. Understanding that we have not provided top and bottom line guidance for calendar year 2015, we'll do that the closing of the deal for the combined enterprise. Ahead of that, we would plan to continue to provide guidance on Zimmer on a standalone basis.", "I will say that we understand there is a wide range of estimates that are out there for the combined enterprise, some of which may assume that the closing takes place early in the first quarter, other that may assume the closing take place later in the first quarter and that range will certainly tighten as we provide more specific guidance.", "I am not at all uncomfortable. I think by and large the analyst community has taken the $1.15 to the $1.25 in accretion and cash earnings per share and build that into the assumptions that they're making at this stage.", "Bob Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. So there is nothing that you would point out that would things that we would need to consider as modeling in that sort of a range. Do you think we're missing any major piece as it just comes down to the timing of the close and so I am just trying to get a sense from you, are there things that you think we're not considering that we should be?", "David Dvorak", "Well again, the timing of the close is a pretty big assumption of whether or not you assume it's going to be at the beginning or the end of the first quarter and we provided a bit more detail on average shares in my scripted comments.", "It's not something we had done earlier and are doing that in an effort to provide as much sort of detailed support as we can at this stage.", "Bob Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. I'll leave it at that. Thanks very much.", "David Dvorak", "You're welcome, Bob.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "Thanks for taking the questions. One, a couple, just one clarification and then one follow-up. You talked a little about pricing in the quarter, and some of the trends that sort of affected this year so far. And I think Craig mentioned some of the other commentary that we've heard throughout the year.", "But I'd love to get your sense as to, is the stability that you're seeing with, I'm assuming Persona, some of your new products, and sort of the -- I don't know, maturation of the hospital networks in the U.S. and their cost control strategies that we've seen evolve over the last years, is that something that you expect to be converging downward from where the pricing pressure that you're seeing? Or is this low 2% pricing pressure something you see as sustainable?", "I know it's kind of a difficult thing to predict, but maybe just in terms of new activity, changes in the way hospitals are buying, is there anything that you're seeing that would indicate that this is not a sort of sustainable range over the long term? And then I have one follow-up.", "David Dvorak", "We would see that the current trends as being stable and nothing environmentally changing in a material way Matt that would cause us to at this point believe that the future shorter and intermediate term will look materially different.", "If you reflect back on the guidance that we came into the year in our January call, we said that we were expecting 2% to 3% negative price in the year and Q1 was minus 2.3%, Q2 was minus 2.8%, Q3 minus 2.2%. So very tight within that band and more importantly and substantively to your question, the activities that surround those dynamics are consistent with expectations.", "So holding to that same band for the balance of this year, will give you some specific guidance and color as we get into next year and provide 2015 guidance, but nothing that we see right now would cause us to believe that the environment is going to change dramatically.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "That's great. Thank you, David. And a follow-up for Jim, if I could. You mentioned a few, it sounded like a handful of sort of positives in the gross margin line. But the margin was in fact down a touch year over year. If you could just maybe help us understand how those factors kind of added up to a slight decline, and what we can expect kind of heading into the end of the year?", "Jim Crines", "Sure, well understand coming into the year, we're taking into 80 basis points of headwind associated with the medical device excise tax. So the positive things that I mentioned that efficiencies, we're getting out of our operational excellence initiatives the slightly higher gains on hedge contracts as well as lower excess and obsolescence starters in the quarter -- third quarter this year compared to the third quarter of last year all helped to offset that 80 basis points of headwind, so that the gross margin ratio was only down 10 basis points compared to the prior year.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "And then heading into the end of the year, any seasonal expectations you can sketch out for us.", "Jim Crines", "Well I would tell you we're obviously taking -- we've increased our guidance with respect to the currency headwind for the fourth quarter. That does typically result in somewhat higher gross margin ratio as we realize gains on hedge contract and a lower topline on -- reported topline on our international revenues.", "That together with what we were just talking about in terms of more moderate price pressure, I would tell you sort of contribute to gross margin expectation for the fourth quarter that would put us toward the high end of the range of what we're guiding to for the full year.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "Got it. Thank you, Jim. Thank you, David.", "Jim Crines", "Welcome.", "", "David Dvorak", "You're welcome, Matt.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "Thank you. Let me start with the 2% to -- sorry, the 2.25% revenue guidance for the year. Maybe just give us your thoughts, and obviously you're not guiding yet, but if you think about the Company pro forma for Biomet. Biomet grew just this last quarter organically if you adjust for their acquisition, slightly faster than that.", "Can you just talk about how you think about revenue growth at this company pro forma? And then I was hoping you could spend a little bit of time on the money you're setting aside to lock in distribution. If you could tell us a little bit more about that, and how expensive it will be, that would be great. Thanks.", "Jim Crines", "Sure. Mike, this is Jim. I would just go back to the guidance we provided when we announced the deal and expectation that in the short term, the combined enterprise we would expect to be growing in line with market understanding that there could very well be some disruption.", "The sales channels are getting integrated, but just believe that we have significant opportunities with respect to cross selling that can offset any revenue loss that we might experience as the sales channels are being integrated.", "Now as what the market growth will be globally in 2015, we'll provide some color on that when we come out with 2015 guidance somewhere in the range of low to mid single digits, but will be more specific about that when we come out with that guidance in January.", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "And then on the money set aside, I think in the proxy, Jim or David, whoever wants to take this. I think there was $87 million set aside for what I think it was classified as distributor and management retention.", "Can you just talk about how extensive basically the pay-to-stay will be, and the agreements that you are coming to with some of the distributors? What is the one-year agreements, two-year agreements? If you could give us some visibility on that, that would be great?", "David Dvorak", "Sure, and all integration planning is ongoing at this point in time Mike. I think that the disclosure that you're referencing the plans that were put in place by Biomet and so that disclosure is a specific I guess there's anything that is out there publically.", "Those were programs that were designed really pursuant to the negotiation process and the diligence process and we were very supportive of, but Biomet management and Board's decision to put those programs in place, I think that they continue to serve that entity well from whatever we can see within the market place.", "The balance of the cost of those integrations are just lumped up at this point in time and the best estimates that we had at the time of the announcement Mike is what the integration cost would be and just -- we put that out there as just being a certain multiple of the anticipated net synergy benefits.", "But we will be able to firm up those numbers as we lock down the plans and I would be really confident that by the time the closing rules are around, we're going to be able to give you a really specific guidance as to what the all-in integration numbers are going to look like and the pace of retrieving the benefits of the synergies etcetera.", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "Okay. I would just say that as you guys get closer to it, if you could try and give the street just some visibility into the types of agreements you're reaching with the distributors and that would obviously help us gain some comfort in the synergy risk that everybody's been talking about.", "David Dvorak", "Yeah. Noted Mike we'll do that consistent with the lockdown of those plans okay.", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "Perfect. Thank you, guys.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Taylor with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.", "Matt Taylor - Barclays Capital", "Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask one just about the integration and the performance this quarter. So I guess one of the trends in the quarter and recently, is some of those non-recon businesses that you have, have been growing more slowly. The hip and knee businesses had a pretty good quarter this quarter.", "But you referenced before you see a lot of cross-selling opportunities, and I guess can you talk about the differences that you see between combining the large recon business versus combining some of those other ones? Do you expect more commercial synergies at those other businesses that may be sub-scale at Zimmer and Biomet?", "David Dvorak", "Yeah that\u2019s a great question. I would tell that if you look at the portfolios, there are significant opportunities in all product categories Matt. I think that the complementary natures within large joints might from the outside world appear to be a bit more nuance because both of these companies have fairly comprehensive portfolios to begin with.", "But those nuances can make a big difference to the sales force as well and I\u2019ll tell you some of the product fares that we've had consistent with the diligence and integration planning have revealed opportunities that have the sales forces on both sides very excited within the large joint side.", "It really takes on a bit of different dimension when you get into the smaller business that your reference however because those businesses for each company have been challenged by scale historically and when you bring the product portfolios together on day one, you have some really significant enhancements whether material gaps that get filled.", "But then very, very importantly there are kind of couple of big benefits to the combination as it relates to those business that include the capability to have much more scale or R&D pipeline so the cadence of what's going to come out of the development effort is going to be much, much more regular for those smaller business.", "We're going to be able to get to the point where we have scale very competitive portfolios and then we were reinvesting in those portfolios and keeping the sales force engaged, excited, and getting out of ahead rather than filling gaps, which is kind of the trap the end up stuck within subscale. So I think that dynamic changes in a very material way.", "And then secondly, the thing I would point you to just the capability to build out specialized sales forces at the rep level for instance in those different product categories, which again historically because of the scale challenges has been difficult for either company to do fully.", "But we really do see our way towards being able to build out specialized sale forces of the rep level wherever that makes sense wherever that customer call point justifies that kind of an investment. So that's going to put us in a much stronger position. The combined product bag and the focused sales force is going forward.", "Matt Taylor - Barclays Capital", "Thanks. And just a follow-up on price. I think everybody assumes that pricing will stay down, or potentially get a little bit worse in the future. Do you see any scenario where in large joint recon, for example, pricing could get better because of either new products and mix, or because pricing has been down for the last five years.", "David Dvorak", "Well I think that you could see some evidence of some anniversarying out of some of those trends that have created the pressure. I just think it's premature to project things going into positive territory. I think that the stability message is the one that we would use or refrain at this point in time, but the scenario that you put out there is a possibility of some point in the future.", "Matt Taylor - Barclays Capital", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "David Dvorak", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Good morning. And thank you for taking the question. You had some really outsized growth rates in certain regions, if you could just comment on that. In hips it was up almost 10% in the Asia-Pacific region, in knees, EMEA up almost 10% also. What's going on there?", "David Dvorak", "Those teams are really doing a great job Joanne with sales execution. So largely the same portfolio, same competitors, the local dynamics can be a bit difference, but I don\u2019t think those should be categories as being material.", "Those sales teams are just doing an excellent job on the execution side and that is in the first quarter that we have seen that. In Q2 you saw the same very strong knee performance coming out of Europe, Middle East and Africa as well as the very strong hip performance coming out of Asia Pacific.", "So those cross earnings are the types of things that we wanted to transfer back to other markets and I think the big positive that one should take away from that and this is what we communicate internally to the teams is you have the portfolio necessary to compete effectively.", "But look, some of the trends that you saw within the United States Market sequentially from Q2 to Q3 show some important improvement in these categories as well, a pretty significant step up in knees for example and slight improvement in hips.", "So we are going to keep working forward and try to post some numbers on the broad that look consistent with that high-end performance for Asia Pacific on hips and the high end performance for EMEA on knees.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "And then in terms of the merger, could you remind us of when the deadlines are for various regulatory rulings? And then if there's any way to give us some qualitative update on how those conversations are going that would be appreciated. Thank you.", "David Dvorak", "Sure. The timelines that we put on and updates publically are what there is to say about that formally. You know there is a bit more of a formalized chronology that's been put out between now and the coming weeks and through the month of March even in the case of the European filing.", "The U.S. process is ongoing a little bit more of a rolling basis. We're making a good progress and I think I would just say by way of general characterization is that process is tracking absolutely consistently with the diligence that we did prior to announcing the deal and what we are articulated at the time of the deal announcement back in April.", "So everything is running on course and from a timing prospective consistent with our expectations leading us to just reiterate that we have the belief that we will close the deal in first quarter of 2015.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Thank you.", "David Dvorak", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs", "Good morning, everybody. And thank you for taking the questions. I was hoping to start with the spine business because that was, if I look across the drivers of the acceleration this quarter, knees was certainly a call-out, but spine also was a very nice pick-up.", "David, if I go back to your comments on the success you're having with Virage and the pull-through you're getting, could you maybe just put that in a little bit more context about where you are and sort of the full building out of your spine product portfolio? And whether you're at a point that the product bag is competitive, and we can see this type of trajectory continue?", "David Dvorak", "Sure David. First when we just say we're thrilled to get a question this quarter on spine. We're really proud of the team. This is the team that\u2019s been together for several years.", "They are the ones that develop a very intelligent strategy and approach to running that business and importantly to what they were going to focus on by way innovation. Largely that team has been focused from a development effort on the core fusion market and they\u2019ve just been methodically and dogged in executing those plans and at the same time strengthening the distribution channel.", "So I believe that what you saw in Q3 is a shape of things to come by the spine division. And we're probably in the mid innings of building that portfolio out at this point David and you're seeing just the beginnings of the benefits of them executing that strategy with these products rolling out.", "We have about a dozen product launches this year. So a really robust pipeline that has been a combination of pure internal and some mix of external development through licensing and distributional arrangements, but the primary drivers have been the internal projects that include projects like Virage and the benefit of those systems is obvious, right.", "You strengthen the outer body and it shores up you capability to get the inner body device within those procedures and increasingly that team is positioning itself to become much, much more competitive in sought of the teaching institutions and academic centers because we are shoring up our deformity and conflicts in trauma offerings.", "That will continue and I would say that over the course of the next 12 to 24 months those programs will continue to produce very important launches that will complete round up the core fusion line.", "So I think we're in a really good position to start posting consistently positive above market growth numbers and I think it's just going to get stronger in the next 12 to 24 months.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs", "That's helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up on sort of the broader macro. At least the analysis that we've looked at on your core business would suggest that the volume growth that the industry and you have posted over the past couple years is probably below what you would think the normal demographic trends would support.", "And I understand that there's some hesitancy to call out a broader turn in utilization, but as we look at the data points that have surfaced this quarter, whether it's your numbers, your key competitors, some of the hospitals, etcetera, the environment does look to be getting better. So I was just hoping to get your perspective on what it would take to get you more constructive on a sustainable turn whereby we can start to see volume growth reflect more of the demographic nature of the categories you serve?", "David Dvorak", "Yes and I think that you could certain see that in what we articulated happened and we were able to drive within the market on the knee side for instance David within the quarter.", "I think some of the hesitancy on that is understand from everyone\u2019s prospective just the seasonality shift that may be going on primarily within the United States market, but even though U.S. where there are national healthcare systems that are either dialing up or down procedure rates because of our security measures or disciplines in that regard. You get a little bit of lumpiness.", "So that said, we've had really consistent and good performance in the OUS markets. So I think that the underlying procedural demand for the solutions is just unmistakable and may be a topic that hasn\u2019t come up in this call, but you can certainly see that in the emerging markets.", "We continue to perform very, very well in the emerging markets and those penetration rates are low growing classes of folks that are going to be future patients within those markets expanding infrastructure that deliver those solutions and so we're going to be big part of providing those solutions to customers going forward in the important emerging markets.", "So I think that the dynamics are all positive and I just think it\u2019s a matter of stringing some quarter together from a market growth rate that allows people to become increasingly comfortable that the aging population, the fact that per late stage osteoarthritic patients this is the only solution out there and it works really well and its cost effective for the systems. All of that lines up well for the continued health within these markets that we serve.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. I appreciate all the prospective. Thank you very much.", "David Dvorak", "You're welcome", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you guys could update us on just -- I guess it's a two part question, the FDA outstanding warning letters, where do we stand with that?", "And then kind of as a parallel to that, the special items that you guys are reporting. If I look back to the last couple years, it's steadily increased from $75 million to now you're expecting $250 million.", "How much of those, I guess, special items are really going towards resolving some of the FDA warning letter issues? And maybe just some more clarity on how should we think about that number going forward, since the trend is seemingly increased over the last couple years?", "David Dvorak", "So I\u2019ll pick up on the first part of the question, Kristen this is David. The reference to warning letters, pleural, is incorrect. We have a pending warning letter out of the Ponce Puerto Rico facility.", "We're putting a lot of effort into addressing those concerns. Any of the follow-up inspections that take place that result in Form 43 inspectional observations are the top priority for the company as it relates to our quality and operational excellence efforts.", "And we have a lot of focus and good work that's been done there. We're communicating that progress to the FDA on a very regular basis and I am quite optimistic that we're on a very positive track towards resolving any of those outstanding issues going forward.", "I think importantly beyond the reference to the warning letter is just -- this is a core value for the company. It is the top priority to ensure that we have the right quality systems at the foundation of our business and we've made tremendous progress in the last couple of years in particular on that front.", "And that really is going to be enabler going forward for continued not only quality, but operational excellence improvement. It's going to support the financial returns ultimately, but it has remained every aspect of our business and I think that we have the right level of focus and the right effort underway to not only resolve that, but get the company up with the right kind of foundation for the future.", "Jim Crines", "And Kristen this is Jim. With respect to the actual spending as you point out, we coming into the year indicated that we anticipated spending around $250 million on quality and operational excellence initiatives as well as some ongoing spend associated with certain of improved initiatives.", "Slightly more than half of that spend is connected with the quality and operational excellence efforts across all of our manufacturing sites. So although as David pointed out, the warning letter is connected with a single facility where taking the approach to upgrade our quality systems across all dimensions of our quality system, production and process control, design controls, controls around design transfer across all of our facility.", "So it\u2019s a very significant effort, a large project. We've got a very capable leader who is a member of our operating community who is overseeing the entire effort and expect that spend will begin to taper off towards the end of 2015. So it will carry over into 2015, but begin to taper off towards the end of 2015.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank", "By taper off, does that -- I assume it doesn't go away. So we should expect some continued costs, I guess, looking you out for the next couple years? Is that fair or\u2026", "Jim Crines", "I think it's fair to say that it will be reduced significantly by the end of 2015 going into 2016.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank", "", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Jim Crines", "", "You're welcome", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Derrick Sung with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company", "Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I think we're all trying to get kind of a sense of the industry landscape and what that will all look like post consolidation. One of the perspectives that we haven't heard too much from is, what's the hospital customers are thinking and telling you about the impending consolidation.", "And so I was just wondering if you could maybe share some color on your conversations with the hospitals and the hospital administrators, and what they would say about the impending merger that you're going to be undergoing ", "David Dvorak", "", "Yeah I think that the conversations we've had in that regard have been positive at this point. We probably have had more conversations at the surgeon level or I\u2019ve been involved in more conversations at surgeon level and necessarily the administrative level.", "But here is the thing that the administration and increasingly as time progresses the surgeons care a lot about providing better solutions to the patients but finding a way to do that in an increasingly cost effective way and I'll tell you the message that resonates with the administration side deeply is how can we develop deeper and deeper partnership than we had historically to bring those solutions about an increasingly cost effective way.", "The broad musculoskeletal portfolio and innovation within system but as well comprehensive solutions and integrated services is of high interest to the administrative leaders within those institutions.", "And that's an area where I think we're going to be able to put a lot more effort and a lot more resources behind and look to collaboratively construct solution and service offerings that can achieve objectives on both of those fronts.", "Provide better patient solutions and do that in an increasing cost effective way and it just makes sense when you think about some of the reforms that are taking place, pick a market around the world but here in the United States, the reforms that are being driven by the ACA with the delivery model changes whether it's ACO or bundling give these administrators much more of a reason to become in tuning advance of readmission charges and complications coming back to impact their P&Ls.", "And I think that this is a good thing. I think it's going to be a good thing for patients because it's going to allow us to come in these more comprehensive partnerships to provide the solutions and to work towards a common goal of getting it right for that patient in short, medium and the long term.", "Derrick Sung", "", "Great. Thanks. That's helpful. And as a follow-up, just wanted to put your views of the global market trajectory in the context of the accretion from the Biomet deal that you're guiding to.", "So I guess Jim, how sensitive is that accretion guidance that you're providing to whether the global markets end up growing in the low single digits versus the mid single digits? And maybe just any additional color you can provide to us on your global view of the markets would be helpful. Thanks.", "", "David Dvorak", "", "Sure. We said with the announcement I pointed out earlier our expectation is that combined enterprise will be able to grow in line with market in the short term and again will give sort of more specific color on what we think that is in our fourth quarter call towards the end of January.", "If this is a market although we would acknowledge that this is a market that has grown and you know as we've said in a range of low to mid single digit. As you will know this is a high margin business. There is certainly opportunity as you're growing at the higher end of that range for the accretion to be at the higher end of the range that we guided to.", "But I would tell you that within that range, we're very comfortable with $1.15 to $1.25 accretion and adjusted cash earnings per share because at the end of the day it's really a function of the acquired operating earnings as offset by the interest cost on the financing and the dilution associated with the additional shares that are getting issued in connection with the transaction.", "So as long as Biomet continues to perform the way that they have into the close and the acquired operating earnings are somewhere in line with what we sort of expect them to be as we put that model together and we've no reason to believe at this point that they won't be.", "I think Derrick, I would tell you we continue to have a high degree of confidence around the guidance that we've provided on accretion.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company", "Okay. Thanks Jim. That's helpful.", "Jim Crines", "You bet.", "Bob Marshall", "Britney, we have time for one additional question.", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "David Lewis - Morgan Stanley", "Good morning. Maybe just two quick questions. First Jim just a question on margins. If you look at this quarter it's been five consecutive quarters of EBIT margin improvement. So I just wonder what's the sustainability of that trend and sort of your ability to complete your cost program as you head into Biomet.", "And a related to that margin question, I've a follow-up for David as well. The gross margin has not been a source of upside to you, but given the pricing environment, is flat GM is sort of the best we can hope for. So those two questions on margins and then I've a follow-up for David.", "Jim Crines", "Sure. We're going to continue to drive hard on the operational excellence initiative side. There is still a lot of work to do I would tell you David and then a lot of opportunity in front of us and if nothing else, those programs, specifically those associated with manufacturing have to offset the impact of any price erosion that we continue to experience on the topline.", "And we have confidence that they will, but we believe that the opportunity could very well go beyond that to the point where particularly as we see more stability in pricing trends, we could potentially see some expansion of the gross margin.", "With respect to operating cost, some of what we're doing, some of what we had planned in the way of innovating improvement initiatives to drive towards the $400 million of savings by 2016 as a standalone enterprise we will get -- we will get incorporated into and added on to the synergy targets that the teams are driving across for the combined enterprise.", "So we have as we pointed out I think at the time of the announcement, I think good visibility to exactly where we will be going into the close and good visibility into where those additional opportunities around what we need to do to drive towards more efficiency in the administrative functions as well as in the operating functions.", "David Lewis - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then David, just a quick question on FTC, over the last several years the FTC you\u2019ve become increasingly coordinated, but they obviously are independent entities, but you\u2019ve been clear in this first quarter '15 close, no change in timeline, but I think a lot of investors are sort of focused on what we're going to hear this year.", "So what's the likelihood would we hear something from the FTC before we hear from the EU in the first quarter on any possible remediation. Thank you.", "David Dvorak", "Yes, I think they were just -- the process, the way that it has worked from the point of initiation just naturally sets up a circumstance where the U.S. process is ahead of the EU process and so it's more likely that we will progress to the point of clarification in the U.S. than the European side of things as far as the forecast between now and the balance of the year, but obviously we'll keep you posted as we make progress.", "Again things are cracking very consistently with our original analysis and nothing has changed in the many months that we either were evaluating this area of the deal or executing our plans to seek those clearances. So we're very optimistic that we're going to land where we need to land and in getting the deal closed in the first quarter of 2015.", "David Lewis - Morgan Stanley", "Great. Thank you very much.", "David Dvorak", "You're welcome. And with that, I would like to thank everyone for joining the call today and for your continued interest and support for Zimmer. We look forward to speaking to you on our fourth quarter conference call, which is scheduled for 8:00 AM on January 29, 2015.", "I'll turn the call back to you Britney.", "Operator", "Thank you, sir.

I would like to turn the call over to Bob Marshall, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Marshall, you may begin your call.", "Robert Marshall", "Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Zimmer's Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. I'm here with our President and CEO, David Dvorak; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Jim Crines.", "Before we start, I would like to remind you that statements made during this call that are not historical may be deemed forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.", "Also, the discussion during this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included within the earnings release that was furnished in this morning's current report on Form 8-K. This information is also available on our website, www.zimmer.com, in the Investor Relations section.", "With that, I'll now turn the call over to David Dvorak. David?", "David Dvorak", "Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call for the second quarter of 2011. This morning, I'll review our second quarter financial results, providing commentary on the year's progress to date and highlights from our performance. Jim will then provide additional financial details.  As in previous quarters, I'll state all sales in constant-currency terms, and I'll discuss all earnings results on an adjusted basis. ", "Zimmer delivered a solid performance in the second quarter. These results were achieved amidst ongoing challenging global economic conditions and reflect the benefits of recent product introductions across our portfolio. Consolidated net sales for the quarter were $1.14 billion, an increase of 2.1%. And our earnings per share were $1.21, an increase of 11% over the prior year period.", "Impressive performances in our Europe, Middle East and Africa and Asia-Pacific geographic segments supported Zimmer's consolidated results in the second quarter. Compared to prior year, Americas decreased 0.5% while Europe, Middle East and Africa delivered growth of 5.3%, which we believe to be substantially above the market, and Asia-Pacific recorded sales growth of 6.2%. ", "The continued strong performances of our international segments reinforce the positive impact of investments we've made to improve sales execution in established markets, as well as to strengthen our presence in a number of key emerging markets, which provide significant long-term opportunities for growth.  This promise is currently being realized in China, where our Legacy and Montagne businesses continue to perform well. We'll continue to invest in emerging markets, including a strong focus on medical education offerings to help train physicians to meet the demands of a growing patient population. ", "In the quarter, Zimmer continued to deliver against our financial commitments and targets. I'm pleased the progress in our business transformation initiatives has enabled us to allocate incremental resources to growth drivers, including marketing and selling investments in support of new product introductions. Ongoing investments in our sales channels in a number of markets contributed to an above-market performance in these regions. In particular, we've seen the benefits of scale and key markets, where Zimmer's service capabilities and broad portfolio of new and established clinically successful technologies have enabled us to secure significant tenders that support continued growth. ", "Turning to the results of our product categories, Knees sales for the second quarter decreased year-over-year 0.8%, reflecting positive volume and mix of 0.8% and negative price of 1.6%. Our Knee franchise continues to perform consistent with the challenging market in the United States. Increased utilization of PRI and PSI instruments, as well as recent product introductions, including Trabecular Metal augment shapes and cones for revision surgery, contributed solid sales in the quarter. ", "Outside of the United States the Knee business demonstrated improvement, including growth of 8.8% in Europe, Middle East and Africa compared with the prior year period, which is the highest publicly reported growth rate to date for the region in this quarter.  In the EMEA segment, we were successful in securing large tenders in the quarter, which leveraged a long-term track record of clinical success of our NexGen knee System. ", "Hips sales in the second quarter increased 1.8%, reflecting positive volume and mix of 3.6% and negative price of 1.8%. Our Hip business continues to benefit from recently introduced customizable product lines, including the Continuum Acetabular System and the M/L Taper stem with Kinectiv Technology. ", "In the second quarter, we also launched several exciting new additions to our European hip portfolio at the EFORT Congress in Copenhagen. The new Maxera Cup is a large diameter head ceramic-on-ceramic system that we believe will appeal to surgeons for their younger and more active patients. Building on the long-term clinical success of our CLS Spotorno stem, we introduced the CLS Brevius stem in Europe. These stem features a shorter MIS-friendly design that incorporates our Kinectiv Technology, enabling surgeons to interoperatively address leg length and offset through modular neck options. ", "In the second quarter, Extremities sales increased 3.6%. Sales of Trabecular Metal products in this franchise continued to be strong. To return to accelerated growth in this category, we're in the process of introducing several products and instruments, including our new anatomical shoulder combined adapters. ", "Our Dental business again outperformed the market in the second quarter, with sales growth of 15.5%, comprising organic growth of 8.8%, as well as the contribution of the existing Puros and CopiOs allograph products distribution arrangement. The impressive performance of our Dental franchise over the last several quarters reflects the impact of a steady new product cadence in our regenerative portfolio, supported by focused sales execution. ", "This quarter, we announced the introduction of Zimmer curved preshaped collagen membrane, a unique resolvable collagen product that is designed to create an oral environment more suitable for implant placement. The company also recently announced an exciting strategic arrangement to provide Zfx digital dentistry solutions, which allows Zimmer Dental to enter the CAD/CAM crown and bridge market.  Under the agreement, Zimmer Dental will distribute Zfx open platform laboratory scanners, CAD software and custom-milled components. ", "We again delivered above-market sales growth in all geographic segments for our Trauma business in the quarter, with sales increasing 13.6% over the prior year period. The Zimmer Natural Nail family, and particularly the cephalomedullary nail, continues to be a real growth driver as customers learn about its differentiated features, including a unique anatomical design.  We also continue to benefit from increased sales of the NCB Periprosthetic plating system for complex fractures. Success of above-market growth in our Trauma business over the last 2 quarters reinforces the positive impact of our accelerated investments in new product development and sales programs. ", "Zimmer Spine business reported a sales decrease of 6.3% in the quarter. In the United States, reimbursement and pricing challenges continue to impact the spine market. However, recent product introductions are anticipated to contribute to improve performance in the second half of this year, with positive sales contributions from the recently introduced PathFinder NXT percutaneous MIS pedicle screw system and TM-S Trabecular Metal Cervical Interbody Fusion Device. ", "Zimmer Surgical, another business category, again delivered above market sales growth of 7.7% over the prior year period. Zimmer's the market leader in tourniquet products, and we continue to gain share in a number of other categories within our expanding surgical portfolio. ", "In the quarter, we introduced the REX stop bone cement restrictor, and the MIXIGUN single-step bone cement mixing and dispensing system for the European market. We continue to make progress increasing the production capacity for our recently acquired Zimmer surgical power equipment line, which will strengthen our position in this growing market segment. ", "I'll now provide some commentary on the musculoskeletal market more broadly. Global economic conditions continue to impact procedural volumes. Recent economic data, including lowered consumer confidence and continued high-employment rates, are reflected in sustained rates of procedure deferrals above what would be considered normal. The patient pool with access to joint-replacement procedures remains artificially reduced as a result of the economic recession particularly in the United States, where unemployment levels are linked to lower enrollment in private health insurance plans.  As global governments work their way back to sustained economic growth, we would anticipate a recovery in procedure volumes toward more normal levels. ", "With regard to pricing, Zimmer experienced price pressure of negative 0.9% in the second quarter, in line with our expectations. We believe this is indicative of consistent trends, and we now expect full year pricing to remain at or near negative 1%.

I'll now review our second quarter performance in more detail before providing an update regarding our third quarter and full year 2011 guidance. ", "Zimmer's total revenues for the second quarter were $1,137,000,000, a 2.1% constant currency increase compared with the second quarter of 2010. Net currency impact for the quarter was positive, increasing revenues by an additional 5.4% or $57.3 million. This included favorable currency contributions from our euro, Japanese Yen, Australian dollar, Swiss franc and Canadian dollar denominated revenues. ", "For the quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 75%. The margin ratio declined 130 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2010. This reduction was primarily a result of 180 basis points of headwind related to hedge losses, partially offset by lower obsolescence charges in the quarter. ", "The company's R&D expense constituted 5% of sales in the quarter, which represented a 5% increase when compared to the prior year, accelerated product innovation essential to our growth strategy and we expect R&D expenses to grow either in line with or ahead of sales growth as we expand product development and clinical programs. ", "Selling, general and administrative expenses were $470 million in the second quarter, an increase of 7.2% on a reported basis. At 41.3% of sales, SG&A expenses were 10 basis points below prior year.  For the quarter, savings from our transformation initiatives were offset by increased spending on our sales channels in a number of key markets, investing in new sales tools and increased cost for local advertising and recruiting.  ", "SG&A as a percentage of sales is now expected to be approximately 41% for the full year, as our outlook is updated to reflect our ongoing strategic investments in our global sales channels and field market activities, as well as a higher mix of revenues from overseas markets. We expect SG&A expense to increase to around 43% of sales in the third quarter, due principally to seasonality. Consistent with prior years, slower procedure volumes related to summer holidays results in a higher expense ratio in the third quarter. ", "In the second quarter, the company recorded an additional $50 million provision for known and anticipated worldwide claims related to the past voluntary suspension of marketing and distribution of the Durom Acetabular Component in the United States. Special items accounted for $13.5 million in the quarter, the majority of these costs related to our global transformation and restructuring program, including severance and other employee termination-related costs. ", "Integration costs associated with the Beijing Montagne Medical Device Co., SoPlus power equipment, and Zfx digital dentistry solutions transactions also were incurred during the quarter, along with forward integration costs for third-party distributors in the Europe, Middle East and Africa segment.  This included $3.4 million of inventory step-up related charges in cost of goods sold. ", "Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased to $326 million, representing a profit margin ratio of 28.7%. This ratio is 110 basis points lower than the prior year second quarter, reflecting a lower gross margin ratio due to hedge losses, partially offset by a reduction in our total operating expense ratio for the second quarter. ", "Net interest expense for the quarter totaled $9.8 million compared to $14.3 million in the second quarter of 2010. This change is primarily due to having swapped a portion of our fixed-rate debt to a floating rate.

", "David, I'll turn the call back over to you.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you, Jim. Zimmer's second quarter performance demonstrated continued progress against our strategic objectives and financial targets. Sales growth, together with disciplined management of the bottom line in capital deployment, enabled us to deliver value to our stockholders. ", "Before opening the call to your questions, I'd like to take just a moment to recognize the entire global Zimmer team as we celebrate our 10th year as a publicly traded company. In August 2001, Zimmer was spun off from our former parent company. At that time, the company generated revenues of approximately $1 billion, with about 35% of sales generated outside of the Americas. Over the past decade, Zimmer's revenue has grown 4-fold and now over 45% of our sales are generated in international markets. ", "While new product innovations and strategic acquisitions have contributed significantly to our emergence as a globally leader in musculoskeletal care, nothing has been more important or more appreciated than the hard work and dedication of our employees and our sales and distribution teams around the world. We want to thank our valued customers for the trust and confidence that they place in Zimmer technology every day to renew the lives of their patients. Building on a rich history, we're confident that the company is now more strongly positioned than ever to take advantage of the future opportunities for growth, offered by the exciting musculoskeletal care market. ", "And now I'd like to ask Sarah to begin the Q&A portion of our call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Could we get into the granular view of the hip and the knee market just a little bit more?  I know a lot of people that we speak to thought that there was going to be a sort of a second half recovery, that there's a sense of pent-up demand. Is that the right way to be thinking about it? Or has this second half recovery now been moved to the first half of next year? Or are we going to offer something different? Is it just sort of a matter of at time -- at some stage, people will turn into the fold?", "David Dvorak", "Thanks for the question, Joanne. I think that going into the year the view, and the view that we communicated consistently was that we anticipated that the first half of the year was going to be a more difficult half of the year for growth purposes, primarily based upon the prior year comps. And then we saw a slowing down that hit the United States market particularly hard in the second half of 2010. So as we progress into the second half of 2010, although the economic climate hasn't changed in any material fashion to the positive, we do think that the growth rates could pick up maybe 100 to 200 basis points, largely due to the easing comps in the second half. Of course, we've been talking about it for a long time. This market slowdown is not permanent, this is not a normalized procedure growth rate that we're experiencing due to the macro economic conditions. These patients are deferring above normal levels from a time perspective and they're going to come back into the fold at some point, but that broader recovery is going to be dependent upon the macro economic conditions improving, Joanne.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "And then just a second question, if I may. You're building a lot of cash in your balance sheet. Your debt-to-cap is particularly low. You're repurchasing shares. What else are we going to be doing with that cash?", "James Crines", "Sure, Joanne. This is Jim. From a capital deployment point of view, first we'd indicate that we intend to return up to 2/3 of our net income to stockholders on an annual basis through share repurchase programs. Secondly, when the right opportunity arises, we are also interested in acquisitions that fit with our focus on musculoskeletal health and have the potential to create value for our stockholders. We continue to apply rigorous discipline in our valuation of potential opportunities. Among other considerations, we'll examine accretion dilution in earnings and return on invested capital, with an expectation that transactions should be accretive in a reasonable period of time on both dimensions when compared with alternative uses of capital. The internal hurdle rates that we're applying can admittedly be tough to overcome, especially for larger-sized transaction. So our recently completed acquisitions, the Montagne Medical and the SoPlus line of power surgical equipment, make -- are good examples of the types of deals that both meet our criteria and align well with our focus on musculoskeletal health.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Roman from Goldman Sachs.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "I was hoping, Jim, you could go into a little bit more detail on the SG&A line, in particular in the concept of the structuring you announced earlier this year. From the comments on the call, it sounds as though the structuring is -- those savings are more gross, not net savings, and that a good portion of those proceeds are being reinvested into other growth markets. Is that the correct way now to look at it? That is not -- the $183 million number is not a net number?", "James Crines", "That is in part, David, the way to look at it. The savings reflected in our second quarter results from those programs were in line with our guidance of $40 million to $50 million to be realized in 2011. And while we're not yet at a run rate that will get us to $100 million in annualized savings, we still expect to hit that target by the end of the year. There is yet another issue impacting on ratios, though, that may not be as evidenced. We're seeing strong results out of our international markets, and the emerging international markets tend to have higher operating expense ratios. So the change in the mix of our revenues in the quarter put some pressure in our SG&A ratio compared with the second quarter of the prior year. That's something to keep in mind as well that wouldn't be quite as evident. Beyond 2011, while we've not provided target, we have indicated an expectation that SG&A as a percentage of revenue, should continue to trend down. The opportunity for leverage from revenue growth alone, assuming revenues can eventually get back to, and the market can eventually get back to, at least somewhere around mid-single-digit growth in procedures, is very meaningful for us. And then the efficiencies gained from the restructuring and transformation initiatives will provide an additional opportunity for improvement.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. And then maybe just looking at the full year guidance. David, I think you had said that now you expect pricing to be down in the neighborhood of 1%, where I think it's been for the first half of the year. I think the first half is down 0.9%, and that compares to your previous guidance of down 1% to 2%. But you're overall lowering your full year total constant currency guidance. So that would imply on the volume side that things have, on the margin, gotten a tad worse from what you initially had contemplated. Can you maybe just sort of help us think about what's happening just on a volume -- sort of a volume perspective now, versus where things were at the beginning of the year? And what are your underlying assumptions from a macro perspective for the second half?", "David Dvorak", "Sure, David. I think that the most significant difference relative to expectations going to the year is the U.S. market. Procedure volumes are lower than what one might have thought. I do think that we're going to see an improvement in those volumes, at least on a comparison basis in the second half of the year. But to really get back to a normalized level, as I stated earlier in the call, we're going to have to see some stabilization or improvement in the economic conditions, including unemployment. So I think that the U.S. volume is probably the area that is most significantly different. I don't think that it's anything at all that's permanent within the market. I think that it is just an expression of the current economic conditions that we're living through.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And just to clarify that, have things gotten worse as you've gone through the year, or they just haven't gotten better to where things that are just sort of stable how?", "David Dvorak", "No. I think that they've been relatively consistent. Perhaps on a volume basis a bit better in the first quarter than parts of the second quarter, but I don't think you should read into that, that the second quarter's the beginning of a trend.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Sung from Sanford Bernstein.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "I wanted to touch on your Asia-Pac results here, and 2 things related to that. First, last quarter, I think you communicated sort of an expectation that perhaps the Japan disaster might sort of 10% of revenues. I was wondering where you thought of that now, given what you've seen? And then secondly, with respect to the reimbursement -- anniversarying of the reimbursement pricing cuts in Japan, how much of that is embedded in the sales growth numbers that we're seeing? And it looks like still sort of Asia-Pac kind of slowed sequentially. So does that suggest that the sequential flow was even worse if we sort of take out the impact of the benefit of the reimbursement cuts?", "James Crines", "Yes, Derrick, this is Jim. First of all, with respect to Japan, our results for the second quarter were stronger than we anticipated. That market has bounced back in a pretty impressive way, relative to our expectations that we outlined in the prior call. And I would tell you that with respect to the full year guidance, we're still cautious as we project out for the balance of the year. And we understand that hospitals will continue to experience, particularly through the very hot summer months there, rolling blackouts. And that may have some impact on procedure volumes, particularly over the course of the summer months. So we're still somewhat cautious, I would say more optimistic than we outlined on the last call, but still a somewhat cautious view with respect to the balance of the year. As far as the pricing goes, as you pointed out, we anniversaried out of the step-down in pricing that went into effect in April of 2010. So you'll see when we file our Q and the detail that we provide, average selling prices were down a little over 3% in the first quarter. They'll be down still in the second quarter, but down under 1%. So that's in part what has led us to tighten the outlook on pricing for the full year, where we were saying coming into the year it would be at minus 1 to minus 2. We're now, obviously, forecasting an expectation that we'll be at minus 1% for the full year.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And one follow-up, if I could, on your Gel-One product and the upcoming launch there. That's a product that your partner, Seikagaku, got FDA approval on it in March. And I guess what I'm wondering is, what is the -- causing the delay in the launch timing of that product? Is it a supply issue? Is it -- does it have to do with IP issues, litigation surrounding the product? Or what's causing that delay? And what are your expectations for launch? And then also could you comment on the economics of that product. If anything, just -- is that -- will that net-net be a higher or lower margin product than sort of company average?", "David Dvorak", "Sure, Derrick. The work that we're doing since approval of the product is really production paced. So we weren't going to build quantities of inventory prior to that approval coming through. Seikagaku has immediately moved forward on production orders. And we're doing all the preparation work that we need to for a launch, looking at initiating that launch towards the end of this year. So while it won't have a significant impact in profitability or our revenue opportunities for 2011, we are excited about entering that space going forward. And I think that margin opportunity is consistent with our -- the rest of our orthobiologics businesses. So they're attractive margins, and this is a big new market that is a new category for us. So it's all offense once we launch that product and start generating the sales and we're excited about that opportunity.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.", "Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "So David, I just want to get a better read on how you're thinking about the Americas business, in light of the slowdown from 1Q to 2Q and your guidance for third quarter in the back half of the year. So basically, what should we expect for Americas in 3Q? And what's embedded in that guidance?", "David Dvorak", "You should expect to see some improvement in the Americas' performance. And again, Mike, I do think that we start looking at the prior year comps in the second half of the year, and that really is the time period where the economic recession most impacted the U.S. business. Obviously, there's been a suppression of these procedure rates for the last couple of years, but we do think that a good number of people fell out of the insured pool as a consequence, no longer were able to access care in the second half of the year once the COBRA extension period ran out. So it had a profound effect on the second half of the year, most significantly our Q3 and the markets Q3 of 2010. So I think that you're going to see anywhere from 100 to 200 basis point step up in that market, if our projections are correct. Now all of this is premised upon, at least, an economic climate that doesn't worsen. And obviously, I think there will be an upside beyond that if it were to improve.", "Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. The European Hip business is the business that kind of stood out this quarter for sequential improvement. Can you maybe just explain that a bit more? There was -- and the acceleration was pretty noticeable?", "David Dvorak", "The acceleration in Europe that was most significant was Knees.", "Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I meant to say, Knees, I apologize.", "David Dvorak", "Yes. Within our franchise. That's right. And I will tell you that part of that was timing because of success with tenders. But beyond that, we're doing a nice job of executing the sales of the NexGen Knee systems, as well as our other knee systems in that market. I think that that's a team that's really stabilized and gaining momentum in the marketplace, taking advantage of opportunities that they have within the marketplace. And I expect them to enhance their performance in the other product categories including hips going forward, Mike.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Adam Feinstein from Barclays Capital.", "Daniel Sollof", "This is Daniel in for Adam. A quick question, so as we think about hips, obviously you guys had some great momentum with continuum, exiting 2010 coming into 2011. It looks like the business, I guess a little bit this quarter, down 2% x FX, while I think your peers were actually relatively stable in the quarter. I just wanted to get -- I just wanted to know we should think about that. I mean, I know you guys obviously kind of came out in 4Q '09, so I guess we're 18 -- roughly 18 months kind of into the launch. So does that kind of help how we are in that cycle kind of contributes, I guess, maybe a little bit of slowdown there?", "David Dvorak", "It does contribute a bit just to it just because you have your initial mixed opportunities with your existing customer base. But I will tell you, we continue to be very optimistic about our prospects within the Hip category. We have a full portfolio at this point in time. We're doing well with these customizable solutions. We have differentiated technologies on both the stem and the cup side. So we expect to continue to outperform the market going forward.", "Daniel Sollof", "Okay. And then just -- I mean, that's helpful. And just looking at SG&A, I mean, you guys are tracking I guess, slightly above what was the guidance that you kind of, I guess ticked up today, it's about 41%. And then looking at what you said for 3Q, I think you said around 43%, if I heard you correctly. So I mean, just -- not to get too nitpicky, but would that assume kind of going below 40%,  kind of towards 4Q at the end of the year to kind of get where your guidance is? Is my math correct there?", "James Crines", "Again, we have updated the guidance, as you pointed out. Now we're expecting SG&A to be at around 41% for the full year. And I would acknowledge that, yes, your math is correct.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Robert Hopkins", "So David, just to start with you and a little bit more on the success in Europe. Could you be specific on the tenders in Europe? How big were those, and how much did they contribute in the quarter?", "David Dvorak", "I'm not going to break that out, because it very much is normal course business in that market. That's how many jurisdictions operate, and that's the sales process, Bob. But I would tell you that we outperformed the market without the tenders or the unique tenders that were recorded in that quarter. So it's a good performance by our European team, irrespective of the tenders that we enjoyed in the quarter.", "Robert Hopkins", "Okay. And then just to follow up on the balance sheet and on the question of capital allocation. You guys are, as you mentioned, 70% the way through your -- what you assumed for this year. Astra Tech has kind of come and gone. I guess my question is, as we look to the back half, why wouldn't you be more aggressive with your buyback relative to the $500 million? And if you aren't more aggressive with the buyback, should we assume that there are other transactions potentially that could take place of a meaningful size? Just trying to get a better sense of priorities as we look at the rest of the year, given the balance sheet.", "James Crines", "As you pointed out, Bob -- this is Jim -- we were able to accelerate share repurchases in the first half relative to our guidance for the full year, which contemplates $500 million in total share repurchases for the year. But that guidance remains unchanged at this stage. As you know, and as we've disclosed in our periodic filings, approximately 3/4 of our cash and short-term investments are held in jurisdictions outside the U.S. and as we indicate, are expected to be indefinitely reinvested for use in our foreign operations. We certainly, as I pointed out, are interested in continuing to look for opportunities to grow our emerging businesses and opportunities to grow in emerging markets. I think we're seeing some of the benefit of those investments we've already made in both the emerging businesses and emerging markets. But again, we -- as opportunities, you can't predict when they'll hit, but we are active, and we'll continue to be active in looking for those opportunities.", "Robert Hopkins", "So is it really true then that you're less likely to buy back more than you've suggested this year, given that those opportunities are out there?", "James Crines", "As I said, at this stage the guidance is unchanged, and I think I'll just leave it at that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.", "David Lewis - Morgan Stanley", "Just a couple of questions on SG&A, maybe one for Jim, one for David. Jim, just thinking about the third quarter guidance, at the low end of that earnings range, you put your earnings cyclicality versus historical years just for the lower end of the third quarter range. You talked about the SG&A spending. Maybe just talk about your confidence that SG&A spending in the third quarter is more discrete. And you also mentioned emerging markets' selling costs being higher. A lot of other global med tech companies believe that selling costs and emerging markets can actually be lower. So if you could just talk us through those dynamics.", "James Crines", "Sure. And again, as we pointed out -- we went through this last year as well. The increase in the ratio in the third quarter, really is a function of seasonality. We had significant market share in markets -- particularly in markets outside the U.S. where there are extended -- surgeons, patients taking extended holidays and so there's very significant slowdown in surgical procedures over the course of the summer holidays. And we have a certain amount of our SG&A expenses that, as you understand, are fixed. And so we end up with a higher ratio. It's not really a function of increasing the level of discrete spending in the third quarter relative to the first half of the year. Now with regard to the emerging markets, it's really, in our case, a function of just the stage of their development. We're early, if you will, in investing and to build out the principally direct sales channels in those markets. And I think it's given -- again, the stage of their development that leads us to have higher selling, higher operating expenses in the near term. Over time we're going to be able to bring those operating expenses down as we achieve more critical mass in those markets, if we continue to see growth in revenues at the level we're currently seeing, and in some cases, continue to take market share.", "David Lewis - Morgan Stanley", "Very helpful. And David, just a quick question, SG&A, but more from a strategic perspective. Zimmer's been in a pretty enviable position the last several quarters with less exposure to metal-on-metal, and obviously custom knee solutions that others have not had. As some of those others competitors lap those metal-on-metal issues and we see some custom knee relievement for some of those other competitors, are you confident that your existing levels of spending will allow you to kind of maintain share or slightly gain share as the other competitors get a little stronger here over the next 2 to 3 quarters?", "David Dvorak", "We are comfortable. We have detailed plans as to some of the things that we want to do. And in instances, that means re-purposing some of those SG&A dollars. And so we have very active programs. We refer to those as the transformation initiatives. And that's allowing us to drop some of that money to the bottom line. Increasingly, we'll be able to do that as the procedure rates pick back up. But in the meantime, it's been a great funding mechanism to do things that we need to, to make investments in the sales channel on hand on the marketing side. So I think we're well positioned to be able to fund that and continue to improve the ratio notwithstanding those funding needs.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic from Piper Jaffray.", "Matthew Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Just a follow up here on price. Some of the price trends you're seeing, I'd love it if you could expand a little on the dynamic you're seeing in the marketplace. It's about 1% to 2% it looks like in Hips and Knees negative, which I assume, as it's been over the past 2, 3 years, is an aggregate of some contracts being reset significantly lower. And then some contracts kind of flatter potentially up, we would hope. But do you get a sense that most of the big low-hanging fruit has been picked here in terms of big downward adjustments in price, and we're kind of getting into a stage where maybe adjustments are smaller? Any color would be great and I have a follow up.", "James Crines", "Sure, Matt. This is Jim. I think we have said in the past how the compression of average selling prices, particularly in the U.S. market, would continue to play out over the course of this year, protect at some level, even carry over into next year, although were not going to be providing guidance on pricing for next year at this stage. But at some point, it would -- we'd expect it would begin to moderate to the extent that it is just what we described. It's accounts that find their high end of the price curve relative to our mean average selling prices are requesting or demanding an adjustment. We're working through that. We continue to work through that. I think it is -- I think we're comfortable still, with the statements we've made in the past in this regard. And particularly, when you look at the trends, on a global basis, over the past several quarters, if you go back for example to the third quarter of last year, average selling prices for Hips and Knees were down between 2% and 2.5%. That's a step down a little bit in the fourth quarter, step down again. In terms of erosion not being as severe, so it's right around 2% in the fourth quarter. It was under 2% in the first quarter, at least in Knees, and right now 2% in Hips. And here we are in the second quarter, and it's under 2% for both Knees and Hips. So we would and that's how this is being managed. We would expect that as we begin to anniversary out of some of those big adjustments, particularly in some of the larger accounts in the U.S., that the price pressure that we've been experiencing would moderate.", "Matthew Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Great. And then one follow-up here on Dental, just very impressive results again this quarter. Just wondering if you could give us a sense of within that growth rate, where things like implants are growing? Or to what degree some of the new products or biologics are driving that growth?", "James Crines", "Sure. So as we pointed out, the growth rate that we're reporting this quarter and last quarter as well includes the benefits of having changed the distribution arrangement with respect to Puros and CopiOs regenerative product. That's accounting for about 7 points of the 15.5% growth that we're reporting. So you take that out, and you get a sense of what's happening with the balance of the portfolio, including implants.", "Matthew Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies", "So that 7%, you think, is good representative number roughly for where your implant business is growing?", "James Crines", "I think it is representative of where the balance of that portfolio is growing, yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Charles Chon from Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Charles Chon - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I just wanted to transition focus to some of the non-large joint recon business like Trauma and Extremities. So these accelerating trends that we're seeing here, as we think about these businesses going forward, are there product assets Zimmer needs to fill, or it's a matter of just building out better distribution, in terms of gaining better visibility, in terms of growth profile for these businesses?", "David Dvorak", "Charlie, in the case of Trauma, we feel like we have at this point most of the major pieces that we need. There, of course, are always going to be other anatomical sites that we can better address or provide innovative solutions with respect to. But the big leg of the stool that we needed to address historically, had been say, over the last 5 years had been the intramedullary nail line. And Zimmer Natural Nail, with all the different anatomical sites antegrade, retrograde, cephalomedullary nail, tibial nail is fully launched at this point in time. And then as well, the differentiated NCB Periprosthetic plating system, those are products that are making a big difference for us. And we're doing a nice job of taking advantage of the unique anatomical features of the nail. But more broadly, it allows us to penetrate accounts that were difficult for us to penetrate, particularly the Level 1 and Level 2 Trauma centers. So we're going to continue on, we're concurrently investing more in research and development, at the same time that we're investing the strength in our distribution channel, and we think that we're going to be able to create a lot of value by doing so at this point in time. Now going forward, we'll continue to innovate internally, and to the extent that there are external development opportunities that would augment what we already have and be complementary or fill in some spots that we aren't as competitive currently, we go ahead and pursue those transactions at the same time. So we're really optimistic about what we have going on with our Trauma business and are very positive about what kind of growth we can generate in the future in our ability to take some market share and gain more and more critical mass through that process.", "Charles Chon - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Great. So in terms of the transaction-related growth, can you do that without disrupting your leverage goals here?", "David Dvorak", "Yes. And I think that in the case of the business like Trauma, it's most apt to be product line acquisition, technology acquisition, innovation. And the answer is, absolutely, we can do that without disrupting anything else that we need to achieve in the way of value creation.", "Charles Chon - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And that brings me to my second question, which is the company has done a great job achieving relative outperformance throughout 2011 so far. As we look beyond the second half of 2011 into 2012, we annualize the benefit from the transition away from metal-on-metal and Hips or the benefit of new instrumentation in Knees. Without any just specific targets for 2012, can you provide a little more granularity on the specific growth drivers that we can point to that would help the company maintain the momentum that it's been able to achieve here in 2011?", "David Dvorak", "Sure, Charlie. We're very excited about the future beyond 2011 and the back half. I think that we're positioned in the company very well for that future. At some point in time, these procedure deferral rates are going to wash out, and these patients that have been putting off the procedures are going to come back into the fold. There's going to be a boost in the procedure rate. And it's going to very positively affect big markets like the United States market. And we're preparing for that day, let alone the demographic drivers with the Asian population in all jurisdictions around the world. And we believe are providing the most innovative portfolio with respect to personalization of these implants on the large joint reconstruction site. So acetabular cups, such as the Continuum, our stems on the Hips side, with M/L Taper and Kinectiv Technology being incorporated into other stems as well as our patient-specific instruments, are all examples of the personalized approach that we're taking to these implants and differentiated solutions with great political benefits. And then beyond that core aspect of our business, we're very optimistic about our ability to continue to grow in areas like the one we were just talking about, Trauma and our emerging businesses. You can see what we're doing in Trauma. You can see what we're doing in Dental. You can see what we've been doing in surgical for the last many quarters as well. The third prong of growth is really going to come from the emerging markets. And our OUS performance in this quarter is indicative of the kind of growth we think we can generate with intelligent investments to exploit those emerging market opportunities, coupled with good solid execution of our sales and marketing efforts in the developed markets, OUS. So again, large joint reconstruction with personalized solutions, leveraging our market share position and our brand in that space and then getting after the emerging businesses, as well as the emerging markets.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG", "I was wondering if we could just touch back around on pricing trends. You had mentioned that price is down, I think it was 90 basis points in this quarter, or it was just similar to the last quarter, But then you also commented, obviously, that Asia-Pacific was a lot better due to the anniversarying of Japan, I think it was down 3% versus 1% this quarter. So clearly, it looks like the pricing trends got worse either in the Americas or Europe. So could you maybe just review with us just kind of the sequential pricing for the markets geographically?", "David Dvorak", "Sure, Kristen. This is David. I think that you're correct, that it did improve in Asia-Pacific due to the anniversarying out of the Japan price cuts. And it did get marginally worse in the Americas, going from negative 1.3 in Q1 to negative 1.6 in 2Q. But that negative 1.6 is something that we've seen over the course of the 1.5 years. We had a negative 1.6 in Q3 of 2010. I think that the context that one really has to look at is pricing because again, on a global basis, we've been in a pretty tight band as a company, ranging, I don't know, maybe 700 basis points from negative 0.7 to negative 1.4 over the last 1.5 years or more. And for the last 4 quarters now, our global pricing has been either negative 1 or negative 0.9. So again, it's a tight band and relative to conversations that we had around this topic going back sometime when people were fearful that negative 1 was going to become negative 5 or 10, we're just not seeing that. We haven't seen it for a couple of years that we've been talking about it. So I think we're doing a nice job of managing these conditions. As Jim said, we don't think that the pressure in the U.S. is a forever thing. And we do think it'll moderate as we -- if the price compression plays out and we work our way back to a less distributed curve with respect to pricing and our regression back to the mean. But over the last many quarters now, we've been in a pretty tight band on a global basis with respect to pricing.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG", "And do you just the European number of that?", "David Dvorak", "Sure. The European number was positive 1.2 in the first quarter and positive 0.6 in the second quarter.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. And then, just with respect to the kind of SG&A line, do you guys have -- or are you thinking about just kind of changing kind of the distribution model? I know you use independent distribution. I'm just wondering if you're reconsidering perhaps moving more to a direct sales model and/or perhaps cutting some of the rates that you pay to these independent distributors in the U.S. to help offset some of these pricing and perhaps mix trends.", "David Dvorak", "Well, we've done some forward acquisitions with distributors outside the United States markets. And that's been consistent with our strategic plan. We've executed those transactions well. And the transitions have gone well from an integration standpoint also, so it's very much market-dependent. There are instances where we use independent distributors, and we're moving towards such as those OUS markets going direct through the acquisitions. There are other instances where we have hybrid models. And it's very situation-dependent in our case. With respect to the compensation, I think that the adjustments that we've made over the last couple of operating periods is to drive those commission rates to be more performance-based. And I think that that's a path that we'll continue to go down or sustain.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG", "And then just the total sales number, or gross number, if you were to x out some of these acquisitions from distributors and whatnot. What would be an acquisition's more normalized organic growth rate, if you will, for the company?", "David Dvorak", "Those acquisitions aren't material relative to our overall sales, Kristen.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo Securities.", "Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Starting with the gross margin, do you still expect the 90 basis point headwind from FX in 2011? And should we expect to see that reverse in 2012?", "James Crines", "Larry, this is Jim. We do actually -- I think the headwind related to the hedge loss is probably a little bit higher even than the 90 basis points, just given what we saw over the course of the last quarter and the relative weakness in the U.S. dollar going now into the second half of the year. And then we would -- and again, we're only talking about hedges, we're not providing guidance on gross margin for 2012. There are a lot of other things that can factor on gross margin, but we would expect those hedge losses to moderate as we get into 2012.", "Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "And then on the -- do you still expect the knee market to grow in the second half of 2011? I think that was what you said on the last call.", "James Crines", "Sure. But I think if you look at where we are at this stage in the first half of the year, estimates are coming in at around minus 1% for the knee market globally, down a little more in the U.S. than outside the U.S. We -- as we indicated, if nothing else as a result of easing comps, we'd expect to see the market growth rate improve anywhere from 100 to 200 basis points in the second half of the year.", "Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Guys, lastly, on Gel-One, do you think it's possible that, that could have a positive halo effect on your knee implant business?", "James Crines", "I think we talked about this a little bit in the past, before entering into the transaction with Seikagaku, we canvassed our surgeons, getting an understanding of whether or not they prescribed HA and found that, in fact most, if not many of them do, and our partners who are more focused on sports medicine do as well. So this represents a really exciting opportunity for us. And it's going to impact our results and the opportunities we have to further build out our relationship with our current customer base and hopefully some new customers as well in a very meaningful way.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Raj Denhoy from Jefferies.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "I wonder if I could ask a little about the U.S. pricing dynamic. I appreciate your comments about sort of heterogeneity you're seeing that market with the larger accounts maybe extract a little bit more price. Could you maybe talk about how you could cut that in other ways? And are you seeing more pricing out of accounts that maybe have of a higher proportion of surgeon employees as opposed to ones that are kind of in the more traditional model?", "David Dvorak", "We really haven't seen that dynamic. It's been just an assortment of circumstances and the volume of the account, the service levels within those accounts. It's varied from private practice groups to surgeons that are employed by the hospital systems, the larger networks. So it's been business as usual, and just a lot of focus on that topic, obviously, on both sides of the table.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay. Maybe I could ask again just a little bit about the U.S. recon market as well. First on the knee side, a bit surprising that the market remains fairly weak particularly in light of the launch of the custom cutting blocks from you and pretty much every large joint company out there. But why have we not seen an impact of those in numbers yet? Is it still early? Does is it speak to surgeon receptivity of those products?", "David Dvorak", "I think the point that you make made, Raj, is the right one. It's just there is opportunity on those launches, but it's in the headwind of a more significant procedural slow down on a year-over-year basis. And so that's the challenge, and it's not going to be a forever thing. And we really believe that even in the second half of the year, we're going to start anniversarying out of the slowdown. That doesn't mean that the procedure rates will become normalized, but I think that the growth opportunity of the customized solutions -- or customizable solutions is just a bit massed the overarching economic conditions that are driving the procedure rates.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay. And then just lastly, on that comment about easing comps in the back half. And I appreciate that the Knee comp, you guys, does ease. But the Hip comp actually gets harder into the fourth quarter, and you posted a 7% number in the fourth quarter. So maybe you could explain more why you're expecting a resumption in growth in that business against harder comps in the back half.", "David Dvorak", "Yes. I think that the analysis that we've done is you have the extension of COBRA that ran out in the May 2010 time period. And at that point in time due to the employment rates, you can do the math and end up extracting some 5 million patients from the potential pool. The enrollment rates within the private insurance world declined, and you can track those statistics as well. And so we see that biting in a more significant way in the second half of last year. So -- and you're going to get some dynamics in the fourth quarter always, because of the end of the year and the decision to move forward procedures, the extent people have met their deductibles for the year, et cetera. But we do think that there's going to be a positive impact. And it maybe more profound in Q3 than in Q4, but we think that the second half will show improvement.", "James Crines", "And a comment, Raj. It's really directs our expectations with respect to market growth for the second half. And if the market's up, we would expect to benefit from that.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Rick Wise from Leerink Swann.", "Frederick Wise - Leerink Swann LLC", "Let me touch on just a couple of smaller points on the P&L. R&D, can you help us think through R&D directionally. You talked, I think, last quarter about moving up to 5% to 6% range. And you've been at the low end for the first couple of quarters. And when I look back at just the dollars spent, you've sort of been at the $56 million, $57 million level for the last 4 quarters now, sequentially. Just do you know -- how do we think about the range? How do we think about the dollars, particularly in the second half? And maybe just give us some of your thoughts about where spending's going, up or down and where?", "James Crines", "Sure. Rick, this is Jim. As you rightly pointed out, we we're coming out into the year talking about an expectation that it could work its way up towards the higher end of the range over the course of the year. I would tell you at this point, particularly given the sort of the pressure we've talked about that we're seeing on SG&A and part of a function of different mix of revenues, that spending is -- it's certainly going to keep pace -- the increase in spending in R&D is certainly going to keep pace with growth and revenue. But at this stage, I would tell you likely now for the full year to be in a range of 5% to 5.5%, as opposed to 5% to 6% for the full year.", "Frederick Wise - Leerink Swann LLC", "So we will -- the dollars will go up in the second half, is what you're saying?", "James Crines", "That is the expectation, yes.", "Frederick Wise - Leerink Swann LLC", "Yes. And then just one last quick one on tax rate for the year. I think you said around 27%. You were a shade below that in the first quarter -- maybe in first half of the shade below that if I look at the first and second quarter. Are we still at 27% for the year?", "James Crines", "We are.", "David Dvorak", "I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today and for your continued support for Zimmer. We look forward to speaking to you on our third quarter conference call at 8 a.m. on October 27, 2011.  With that, I'll turn the call back to you Sarah.", "Operator", "Thank you again for participating in today's conference call.

Whileonly used at this point in a small percentage of procedures, we expect computernavigation to be a meaningful component of orthopedic surgery in the future. Thisinvestment is going to bolster our smart tool strategic initiative, to bringinnovative tools to the marketplace that will help create more and betterreproducible outcomes for surgeons and patients. We are also looking forward toapplying these technologies to our other segments, such as spine. We expectthis transaction to close early next month.", "At this point, Jim will provide some further details on thequarter. ", "Jim Crines", "Thanks, David. Sales of $903.2 million for the quarterrepresents an increase of 10.2% reported and 7.8% constant currency. As Davidpointed out, these sales results are less than 1% below the company's guidanceand First call consensus estimates. The shortfall is attributed to slower than anticipatedgrowth in our hip, trauma, and OSP product segments.", "The weaker U.S. dollar compared with prior year added 2.4%,or $19.4 million in revenue in the quarter, and also resulted in recognition ofgreater losses on foreign exchange contracts under our hedging program, whichare reported in cost of products sold. As expected, price was flat for thequarter and the Americaspricing contributed a point to growth in the quarter. In Europe,Germany, France,and Italyreported negative price of 3.4%, 1.3%, and 0.5% respectively. While othermarket in Europe were flat or slightly positive.

Ouradjusted gross profit margin of 77.9% for the quarter reflects a 20 basis pointimprovement over prior year, and a sequential improvement of 20 basis points aswell from the second quarter.

", "Selling, general, and administrative expenses totaled $353million, and improved as a percentage of sales by 130 basis points comparedwith prior year. The sequential quarter increase of 40 basis points in SG&Areflects higher fixed costs as a percentage of revenue during the slower summermonths. SG&A also reflects lower share-based compensation expense in thequarter, as we recalibrated expected payouts on the company's three-yearperformance-based incentive program. Settlement, acquisition integration, and otherreflect charges included in our GAAP results, but excluded from adjustedresults for better apples-to-apples comparison. ", "According to the Civil Settlement Agreement we entered intowith the Department of Justice announced September 27th, we agreed to pay asettlement in the amount of $169.5 million. The amount was recorded and paid inthe third quarter out of available cash on hand.", "Acquisition, integration and other amounted to $2.9 millionin the quarter, comprised principally of costs pertaining to 2007 acquisitions.", "Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased 14.9% to$298.3 million, at 33% our adjusted operating profit to sales ratio shows animprovement of 130 basis points from prior year.", "Interest income for the quarter amounted to $1.8 million,adjusted net earnings increased 15.5% to $215.4 million, and adjusted dilutedearnings per share rose 18.2%, to $0.91 on 236.8 million average outstandingdiluted shares. These adjusted earnings per share are inclusive of approximately$0.04 of share-based compensation. At $0.19, reported diluted earnings pershare including the effect of the one-time DOJ settlement charge, decreased 75%on prior year reported EPS of $0.76.", "Now let's turn to the tax rate at 28.2% adjusted for the quarter,and 28.4% year-to-date, the effective tax rate is in line with expectations andthe guidance provided on the second quarter call. We anticipate the effectivetax rate for 2007 to be around 28.4%. ", "Maintaining or reducing the effective tax rate with ourcurrent structure and geographic mix of revenues and profits will depend on ourtaking additional steps to further diversify our manufacturing footprint, orour geographic sources of revenues and profits. As we mentioned earlier thisyear, for the time being we are seeing upward pressure on the tax rate, due togreater growth of products with high margins like Gender knees being sold inthe U.S. Wehave programs in place that will allow us to begin realizing tax benefits in2009, but in 2008 we expect to see an increase relative to where we are now. Wewill quantify this exactly when we deliver 2008 guidance, but would not modelin anything less than our 2007 rate at this point.", "As indicated, third quarter weighted average diluted sharesoutstanding were 236.8 million. During the quarter we repurchased 1.97 million sharesat a total purchase price of $155 million, or an average price per share of$78.85. Taking into account the interest income foregone on the cash used tobuy back stock and the timing of repurchases, we estimate that repurchases madein the quarter had a negligible effect on earnings per share. On a year-to-datebasis, we have repurchased 5.6 million shares, at a total purchase price of$460.6 million. As of September 30, 2007, we have remaining capacity to repurchase up to $737 millionof our stock under our repurchase program. For us in the absence of significantdemands on our cash, stock repurchases remain an effective and efficient use ofavailable free cash flow.", "Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $166.8million, down from $302.7 million in the second quarter as a result of thesettlement payment of $169.5 million. ", "Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarterincreased to $58.2 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $80.8million, including $33.3 million for instruments, and $47.5 million forproperty, plant, and equipment. We anticipate full year 2007 spending forproperty, plant, and equipment to be in a range of 200 million to $210 million.Instrument investments for 2007 are expected to be in a range of $140 million to$150 million. ", "Free cash flow was $86 million for the quarter, also wellbelow trend in the prior year as a result of the settlement payment.", "Finally, inventory days on hand finished the quarter at 330days, an increase of 20 days from prior year, reflecting greater investments infield inventory consignments in support of our new products. Our trade accountsreceivable days sales outstanding finished the quarter at 60 days, slightlyhigher than the prior quarter and prior year.", "With that, I will turn the call back over to David.", "David Dvorak", " Thanks, Jim. Toconclude, I would like to comment on our guidance. As disclosed in our pressrelease last night, we have updated our fourth quarter and full year 2007guidance so I will quickly review those details with you now.", "We expect fourth quarter sales to be in a range of $1.027billion to $1.032 billion, or 10% to 11% growth over prior year, and adjustedearnings per share growth in a range of $1.03 to $1.05, or 1% to 3% over prioryear. With these updates, we expect full year 2007 revenue to be in a range of $3.851billion to $3.856 billion, an increase of 10% over prior year and adjustedearnings per share to be in a range of $3.91 to $3.93, an increase of 14% overprior year. ", "This updated guidance reflects a $33 million to $38 millionreduction in constant currency growth, partially offset by an increase incontribution from foreign exchange of $15 million. Our constant currency salesgrowth has been updated to account for lower sequential growth rates in the Americas,underperforming sales trends in our Trauma and OSP categories, and theforecasted impact of hip resurfacing in the United  States market. ", "Exiting the second quarter, we anticipate an incrementalgrowth from our core reconstructive segments and a tailwind from the foreigncurrency to drive us through tougher comps in the second half. While we feelthe third quarter was solid in light of the tougher comparison, we simplyaren't experiencing the sales acceleration we had planned for.", "As a result, our adjusted earnings guidance has been loweredby $0.11 to $0.13 in the fourth quarter comprised of the following elements.First, $0.07 to $0.08 from the $33 million to $38 million reduction in constantcurrency sales, and that is predominantly within our higher margin hip and kneeproducts in the Americas.It is important to note that the incremental earnings from the $15 million ofsales contributed by foreign currency are negligible, and that is all a resultof our hedging program.", "Next a $0.01 reduction due to foregone interest incomerelated to the Department of Justice settlement. Also, $0.02 to 0.03 forestimated payments and reimbursements related to the appointed monitor. Finally,a $0.01 bit of dilution from the expected acquisition of ORTHOsoft as wepreviously disclosed.", "This updated guidance is not how we had planned to wrap upan otherwise good year in sales and earnings for Zimmer. With almost six monthsof reviewing the state of business in this new role, it has become clear to methat several operational and product-related challenges are constraining ourability to take full advantage of the opportunities available in themarketplace, some of which are impacting our largest product categories.", "First, the operational constraints we initially faced inresponding to the Gender Knee demand, but fixed during the second quarter,haven't allowed us to fully exploit this opportunity to date. These constraintslimited our ability to expand our market share in units and have led primarilyto mix upgrades within our current customer base, which will anniversary in thefourth quarter. Competitive countermeasures and the lack of Gender in ourNatural-Knee brand are contributing a slower than expected competitive uptakehere. So while we still there is tremendous opportunity for Gender knees, theopportunity will likely take a bit longer to materialize. We are just nowstarting the limited release of the Natural-Knee Gender Flex, and will berolling out Porous components for the next-gen brand in the first half 2008.", "Second, on the product side, we do face a near-termchallenge in hips with the strong uptake of hip resurfacing in the U.S.market. In the fourth quarter, Zimmer will enter limited release of the firstof two Gender Solutions hip stems, the Gender Solutions M/L Taper withconnective technology. We believe that the intra operative flexibility and MIScompatibility of this stem will make it a very competitive new hip product for2008. This should help, but not entirely offset our lack of a resurfacingproduct in the U.S.market. Our path to resurfacing, as we have discussed in the past, remains boththe IDE study and a PMA filing with foreign data.", "Third, we also need to address certain product gaps andsales focus challenges with respect to some of our other businesses such as trauma,spine, and our orthopedic surgical products. ", "Finally, as evidenced by the estimated impact on the fourthquarter, the incremental expenses related to the federally appointed monitorare likely to be significant over the 18-month term. As a result of some ofthese challenges, we will wait to issue 2008 guidance as part of our fourthquarter call and full year conference call in January. ", "In closing, we want to be clear that these challenges do notin any way change our fundamental view of the marketplace. We still see anattractive environment with respect to both volume and mix opportunity. As aresult, we are in no way wavering from our goals to expand our leadershipposition in hips and knees, and accelerate the growth of our other businesslines through measured investment. ", "What we will not do right now is make dramatic changes inour core strategy, or attempt to cover these sales shortfalls and incrementalexpenses by omitting investments that we believe will maximize our longer-termgrowth potential. That would be inconsistent both with our managementphilosophy and our shareholders' interest. ", "That concludes our formal remarks on the quarter. At thistime we would be happy to take any questions you have.", "Question-and-AnswerSession", "Operator", "Your first question comes from Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank.", "Tao Levy  - Deutsche Bank", "If we could just touch on the guidance, you did a decent jobof  running through your currentthinking. Again, the decline in some of the areas especially, for example, yourhip comment on the back of a pretty strong third quarter just doesn't seem tomake sense, given what we are seeing in the marketplace with some of the otherhip manufacturers, not necessarily on the hip resurfacing side are seeing intheir base business.", "Just wondering, is there anything else going on there? Isthere some impact from, for example, the DOJ settlement that you think willnegatively hit your ability of your salesforce to sell products?", "Jim Crines", " No, Tao, the feedbackthat we are getting from our distributor network is that surgeons that useZimmer products for primary hip replacements, many of them now have beentrained and are using, in most cases, frankly, the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing Deviceon their younger patients. So we are seeing some significant cannibalization ofour own business through our customers, through that sales distributionchannel. ", "I also mentioned we are seeing some competitive challengesas well in our Revision Hip line. We saw some erosion in that business in thequarter as well.", "David Dvorak", " As a consequence ofthat, there is pull-through revenue opportunities that come with those Revisioncases, as well as those resurfacing cases as they train surgeons.", "Tao Levy  - Deutsche Bank", " So what type ofstrategies can be put in place to try to combat that? Also maybe an update onyour U.S. hipresurfacing product, timelines, expectations? I know you touched on some of thedata.", "David Dvorak", "We are really excited about the M/L Taper with connectivetechnology, first and foremost. The intra operative technology of that productand the MIS capabilities with respect to the M/L Taper, we are receiving greatfeedback from surgeons with respect to, so we are optimistic that we are goingto be able to generate nice growth in that area in 2008.", "With respect to resurfacing, you\u2019re right, we are workingtowards filing a PMA with foreign data, and that hopefully, is going to be a2008 event, but that puts us out yet a couple more years from where we restright now, and if we need to go through a full IDE/PMA process to developU.S.-based data, that it likely a couple years further out.", "Tao Levy  - Deutsche Bank", "In the prior conference call you talked about new productsthat were going to be launched in the fourth quarter that would help increasemomentum going into 2008. You touched on obviously the Connective products. Butthere are other products which you haven't talked about, which you hadhighlighted in the past, De Novo technology, mobile bearing knees, for example,I was just wondering there are any delays there, or do you just now expect lesscontribution from those new products? Thanks.", "David Dvorak", " The De Novo productin the first instance, the natural tissue we have never said that it is allthat significant in the way of revenue generation. We are very excited aboutthe longer term opportunities with the De Novo brand, but that is further out. Theproducts that will be impactful in 2008 include a gender porous component whichwe are expecting to launch in the first half of 2008, and then as well thatNatural-Knee launch with the Gender Flex, which is under limited release rightnow, but it will find traction and become meaningful in 2008. With respect tothe mobile bearing knee, we are awaiting FDA approval still, and have not heardanything more on that front since our last call.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley.", "Matt Miksic  - Morgan Stanley", "I have to push you a little here on Q4. It seems after whatlooked like a pretty decent Q3, and I understand hips showed some signs ofweakness, maybe in growing a little bit south of the market, it just feels almostpremature here to just punt on the pressure from resurfacing. ", "Can you talk about, it should be what, 10% or 15% of thetotal market, and there is one player on the market, another launching towardsthrough the end of the year? Can you help us understand at least what you areseeing so far in the market that is causing you to be so cautious?", "Jim Crines", "Matt, some of what we are seeing, as David had indicated, wehad anticipated once we got to where we needed to get to, as we talked about onthe second quarter call with the inventory consignment and instrument placementto the field, that we would begin to see some competitive uptake with theGender Knee. As we look at our results for the third quarter, and as we look atwhat has been reported by some of our competitors we are not seeing thecompetitive uptake in the way we had expected to see it. As we look at that andlook at the fourth \u2013 we look at that, we look at the fourth quarter, we aregoing to be up against much tougher comps with having launched the Gender Kneein the third quarter of last year. ", "On the hip side, with having launched in the second half oflast year, the TM Primary Stem, our large diameter head, metal-on-metal device,and then again on the hip side, as I indicated, we are seeing somecannibalization of our primary hip business to resurfacing.", "Matt Miksic  - Morgan Stanley", "So you are looking for some things to offset the pressurefrom resurfacing, and you are not seeing those come through, and that combinedwith the tough comps? Am I reading that right?", "Jim Crines", " Yes, and the newproduct that we are in the process of rolling out, the Natural-Knee on the kneeside, that's still in limited release. It goes into a fuller release, and evenas we talked about in the past with the Gender launch, these product launchestake several quarters. So we won't see the M/L Taper with connectivetechnologies, a similar issue, in terms of where we are with that launch. Thatis in limited release in the fourth quarter, and will go into full release inthe first half of next year. So the uptake on those new products will have moreof an impact in 2008 than they will in the fourth quarter.", "Matt Miksic  - Morgan Stanley", "David, you talked about the Gender Knee from a unit sharestandpoint taking longer to have an impact. Can you help us understand what youmean by longer? Longer meaning how far out?", "David Dvorak", "We are looking to redouble our efforts on that product, andwe are optimistic about the future of it, but  that is probably going to be a 2008 event forus as well, and it is going to come in the form of both the next-gen offering,as well as the porous variant of that offering, Matt. As we get into a fulllaunch of the Natural-Knee, with the Gender Flex solution as well, we are goingto be able to find some traction with that one in 2008. ", "So I think that all of those are really going to be 2008events, and that is part of what you are seeing impacting our fourth quarterguidance.", "Matt Miksic  - Morgan Stanley", "So longer into 2008, but not longer into 2009?", "David Dvorak", "That is correct.", "Matt Miksic  - Morgan Stanley", "Just a clarification on this, the expense, the charge aroundthe federal monitor. Could you give us a little more color about what that is,and is that a recurring expense we should start taking out of our thinking onnext year's numbers? Any color you can provide on that would be helpful.", "Jim Crines", " Sure. Those areestimated payments and expense reimbursements that relate to the monitor'sservices and obligations under the deferred prosecution agreement. So I thinkthat at this point in time you have to consider that to be an 18-month termexpense, and obviously as we gain greater clarity as to what that is likely tolook like through 2008 we will bake that into our guidance that we provide toyou.", "Matt Miksic  - Morgan Stanley", " Am I reading thisright? Is that like $8 million a quarter?", "Jim Crines", " That is correct. Therange is $8 million to $10 million a quarter, Matt.", "Matt Miksic  - Morgan Stanley", " Wow. That seems likea big number for expenses. This is what? Travel and coordination, and I don'tknow what else? That just seems like a big number.  I think a little bit surprising, since no oneelse has really talked about it.", "David Dvorak", " Not just travel, Matt.I wouldn't describe it as that. That it's fees, professional fees.", "Matt Miksic  - Morgan Stanley", " So fees, so the feethat they get for being the monitor, basically, is what you are saying.", "David Dvorak", " That is right.", "Matt Miksic  - Morgan Stanley", "Legal fees and so on. Finally, stepping back from thechanges to Q4, the changes in your expectations for some of these productshitting in '08 and taking longer, you have talked recently about the modelaiming for double-digit top-line growth, acceleration to the bottom line. Has anythinghappened here changing that? Can you give us an idea how you look at thelong-term fundamentals of this business?", "David Dvorak", " The objectives havenot changed, Matt. We are going to execute our strategy and expand ourleadership position in hips and knees, and then accelerate the growth of our spine,dental, trauma businesses. So nothing has changed in the core strategy. This isguidance with respect to the fourth quarter, based upon some of the product depththat we have here, and we expect to find more traction in 2008, but obviouslywe will give you a lot of clarity around what that is going to look like whenwe get to finishing our plans, and coming back to you in our fourth quartercall.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers.", "Bob Hopkins  - Lehman Brothers", "Somewhere in the call I think I might have missed one thing,where you did comment about '08 growth rates. It was either on the top or thebottom line where you said is it wouldn't be less than 2007. Could you justclarify what that was?", "Jim Crines", "The comment about less than 2007 was just in the context ofthe tax rate. As David indicated, we will be giving 2008 guidance in January.", "Bob Hopkins  - Lehman Brothers", "Given the health of the overall market, would it be safe toassume that it is unlikely that you would be growing less than 7% to 8% or 9%in 2008?", "Jim Crines", " As we indicated, wewill be providing guidance for 2008 inJanuary as we get through our own internal planning process. It all comestogether sort of towards the back end of the fourth quarter here.", "Bob Hopkins  - Lehman Brothers", "Just in terms of operating margin going forward, given theissues you are talking about in terms of hips and knees and the challenges youface there, I guess primarily on the hip side, and then also, as you mentionedlast quarter, a need to increase investment in spine and trauma, and some ofthe other businesses, can you drive operating leverage in your business in2008, or might that be a year where the incremental investment and thechallenges you face make it a limited year for operating margin expansion?", "David Dvorak", "Yes, we are going to continue to move forward with our plansto invest, as we have been talking about, in those other businesses. We feelthat is essential for the long-term health of the businesses and in the bestinterest of the shareholders. We will clearly be challenged in that regard tothe extent that these monitor costs are incremental, and that it is the rightway to view those costs.", "Bob Hopkins  - Lehman Brothers", "Can you talk just a little bit more about that? Becauseperhaps I don't understand exactly what is going on here, but $30 million to$40 million in expenses seems an exorbitant amount, and I was wondering if youcould just break that down for us? I know you said previously it was fees, butare there consulting fees in there? Can you break that down a little bit more?Because again, it seems like a very, very high number.", "David Dvorak", " The fees areprincipally going to be professional fees, obviously and I think that the bestwe can do is to point you back to the deferred prosecution agreement, Bob, and  the substance of those responsibilities areoutlined in a fair amount of detail there. Those responsibilities and thatoversight obligation that the monitor possesses are what will drive theprofessional fees. As I said, the DPA is the document that describes what theyrelate to.", "Bob Hopkins  - Lehman Brothers", " Okay. I will go backand take a look. A 30,000 footquestion around your philosophy around guidance, because obviously this is thesecond conference call where we are communicating live here, and I was struckby a comment at the beginning of the call where you seemed to express somedegree of satisfaction that you almost achieved your goals.", "I am wondering going forward as you give guidance, howshould we be thinking about that guidance? Are those aspirational goals thatyou hope to meet, or are those things that you are 120% sure of, and hope tobeat? Just trying to understand the philosophy around guidance as you will beproviding it.", "David Dvorak", "We are looking to give you the best visibility we can as tothe direction of the business. The comments on the front end of this call, wedon't think there's anything to be ashamed of about the top line growth,certainly not the 18% bottom line growth for this quarter, but we are trying togive you the best visibility we can as to what we expect the fourth quarter tolook like in light of these product launches and the timing of the traction forthose products.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steven Lichtman - Banc ofAmerica Securities.", "Steven Lichtman  - Banc of America Securities", "Again on Gender, I just want to get some clarity. In termsof the operational constraints, obviously I can understand why that has beenimpactful over the past few quarters, but I am still unclear as to why that'sgoing to be unclear over the next few, assuming that those constraints are nowbehind you. Could you flesh that out a little bit more please?", "David Dvorak", " The constraints thatwe are referring to in the fourth quarter are the fact that the Gender Flexcomponent for the Natural-Knee system is still in limited release as we workour way through the fourth quarter, which means we have a limited number ofsets in inventory, consignments going out into the hands of the developers anda few other surgeons. So as we get into 2008, and we will work our way over thecourse of the first half of the year, putting out more significant numbers ofinstruments and inventory consignments, to support the full launch of thatproduct. A similar story, Steve, on the Porous Gender Flex component for thenext-gen system.", "Steven Lichtman  - Banc of America Securities", " But on the core GSF,that was the issue previously in terms of the constraints in terms of gainingmarket share potentially, that is behind you, right? Is the feeling that youneed the Porous coated now in order to be effective? What about the core GSF,excluding the Natural?", "David Dvorak", " On the core GSF, itis really a matter of taking full advantage of the sets that are deployed inthe field. We are hitting a point now where we are anniversarying the mix, andso the unit growth has got to drive the performance in that area, and we justdidn't see that acceleration to the extent that we were expecting in the thirdquarter, and that is really the primary basis for what we are projecting outfor the fourth quarter. ", "So we need to do a better job of taking advantage with thecore GSF.", "Steven Lichtman  - Banc of America Securities", " In terms of thefourth quarter, on the EPS impact of the sales reduction, it still seems alittle bit high to me relative to the sales reduction, unless the operatingmargins on that are very, very high. Is it just that? Is there any incrementalspend that we are starting to see already as you are starting to plan for 2008?", "Then maybe following on to that in response to Bob'squestion, you were talking about the incremental spend in trauma and spine, butas we think about next year, are there going to be incremental spends as wellin the core hip and knee business that you now believe you need to make?", "David Dvorak", "Well on the $0.07 to $0.08, that is at the margin the impactof the sales reduction of $33 million to $38 million. So there are noincremental expenses reflected in that $0.07 to $0.08. Whatever investments wehave contemplated going into the fourth quarter we have clearly taken that intoaccount in the guidance that we provided for the quarter.", "Steven Lichtman  - Banc of America Securities", "Next year, as we think about that increased level ofinvestment, previously you've talked about spine, dental, and trauma. Is hipsand knees and area that we are going to be seeing increased investment as well?", "Jim Crines", " We are going to seeinvestment for sure. We had some significant investments, as you well know, inthe first half of this year in DTP. We expect to have similar levels ofinvestment in 2008. Not in the same program, but will be directed certainly atthe opportunities that we have in hips and knees.", "Steven Lichtman  - Banc of America Securities", "Going back to these monitor costs, is this a consistentexpense per quarter, and I guess all on the SG&A side?", "Jim Crines", " That is the right wayto think about it at this stage.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Mullikin - Piper Jaffray.", "Mark Mullikin  - Piper Jaffray", "I just want to talk about the monitoring costs a little bitmore. Do you know if your costs differ from your competitors? Are differentcompanies here being held to different standards, as far as the amount ofeffort that is going into the compliance?", "David Dvorak", " We don't have anyvisibility, obviously, to the expenses that relate to the monitors for theother companies. The settlement agreements and resolution agreements thatrelate to the matter do have the same substantive provisions in them. So onehas to expect that the oversight is going to be consistent, but I can't tellyou what the expenses are going to translate into for the other companies.", "Mark Mullikin  - Piper Jaffray", "Just in the spine and trauma businesses, can you give us anidea of specific steps that you are going to take to rejuvenate growth in thoseareas?", "David Dvorak", " Yes, we can speak tothat. On the spine side, we saw a little bit of improvement in the performancein this quarter and would expect some more in the fourth quarter. But it is offof a small base business for us. Principally our short-term opportunities thererelate to the shoring up of the Fusion line with some of the product that wepicked up from the Endius transaction. We are expecting better things in thefuture from that division on that front, as well as Dynesys presents us withgood opportunities going forward. ", "We need to make other internal and external developments andinvestments to continue to establish that as a more significant business.", "On the trauma side, as we have talked about in the past, wehave a very strong product line in certain areas, but a weak line in otherareas. Principally our strength resides in plates and screws right now, in thearea of weaknesses our nail line is one that we are looking to shore up withsome internal development efforts. So that is a gap that we look to fill as wework through 2008. But it is unlikely to be impactful any time in the firsthalf of 2008. It is probably going to be more towards the end of that year. ", "Beyond that we just need to do a better job on sales focuswith respect to trauma and that is a global issue that we have got to resolve.", "Mark Mullikin  - Piper Jaffray", " So at this point,your trauma salesforce is also within reconstructive is it not?", "David Dvorak", " That is correct.", "Mark Mullikin  - Piper Jaffray", " Do you have plans todivisionalize that in '08?", "David Dvorak", " We have plans tobring greater focus to it within the existing structure.", "Mark Mullikin  - Piper Jaffray", " How about plans foradding sales reps? Do you feel like you need to add more resources to spine or trauma?", "David Dvorak", " All of thosedivisions, as well as hips and knees for that matter, that is something that weare constantly assessing, and obviously always adding.", "Operator", " Your next questioncomes from Kristin Stewart - Credit Suisse.", "Kristen Stewart  - Credit Suisse", "I was wondering if you could talk about the distributorsthat you have got relative to your sales expectations, it would seem that withthe investments that you have made you should be able to generate a little bitmore by way of sales. I am just curious if the guidance related to any declinein your expectations for those distributors that you brought on board? Thanks.", "Jim Crines", " Kristin, we are stillin the process of integrating those acquisitions. They are contributing, and wedo expect over the long term that they will contribute in line with theexpectations that we had as we entered into those deals.", "Kristen Stewart  - Credit Suisse", "What were the expectations for when they would startcontributing? Is it a couple of quarters? A year or more? I don't know ifthere's any non-competes that you need to work through?", "Jim Crines", "That is a level of detail, Kristin, that, you know, I am notgoing to provide on this call.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan.", "Mike Weinstein  - JP Morgan", "Let me just clarify a couple of items. Jim, the math on the $33million to $38 million sales going down to $0.07 to $0.08 EPS, using thecorporate tax rate that implies a pretax operation margin of 70% to 80%? Isthat right?", "Jim Crines", "You got that about right, Mike.", "Mike Weinstein  - JP Morgan", "On the spine business, you guys bought Endius earlier in theyear. I think you said they did about $13 million in '06, and it was obviouslytracking higher. Is the Endius deal not working? What is going on there?Obviously net of Endius, it doesn't seem like that business is growing rightnow.", "David Dvorak", " That transaction, weare quite optimistic about. It is a good product fit for us, Mike. The realityof that type of a deal is, it is a small business, they have an independentdistributor network, and you are going to lose some sales as you integratethat, which is something that we anticipated. The important point for us isthat we get the products including the Title System, the Minute System, as wellas the [inaudible] system, and by the end of integrating that in, and gettingenough instruments and inventory out in the field we are already beginning tosee some decent traction with that. ", "It is going to be a revenue synergy deal. In the short termyou are going to lose some of those revenues because you are integrating thoseindependent distributors.", "Mike Weinstein  - JP Morgan", "Understood. It seems like with the smaller spine deals thatthe whole industry has done in the last few years, that every single one ofthem ends up being tough on the integration. Is that a fair statement?", "David Dvorak", " Because of thedistribution channel, I there are issues there, but I will tell you that webuilt that into our business case. Our view as to the benefits of thattransaction have not changed.", "Mike Weinstein  - JP Morgan", " David, I want tocircle back to the resurfacing discussion, because you have raised this asbeing an issue on the business in the short run, which makes us all wonder whenare these guys going to be able to have a product in the U.S.?There is an open question there about your ability to file a PMA with foreigndata in 2008. When do you think will you get visibility on that?", "David Dvorak", "All we can do is give you updates on a quarterly basis as tohow we are tracking in that regard. We can't give you any assurance that we aregoing to be successful on that front with the foreign data, obviously, and ifwe are, it is a couple of years out, and if we aren't and we have to go througha full IDE/PMA to develop the U.S. data, it is obviously about double that timeperiod.", "Mike Weinstein  - JP Morgan", "The Mobile Bearing Knee, you really didn't talk about itreally at all here. Someone asked a question about it. You made a comment andyou haven't had a discussion with the FDA, you haven't heard from the FDA sincethe last earnings call, which would have been three months ago. It doesn'tsound like your visibility is very good on the timing of that approval, ormaybe you can give us a little bit more?", "David Dvorak", " We have doneeverything that we can do on that, and we are awaiting the FDA's response to usand so there really isn't anything more to tell you at this stage.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Raj Denhoy - Bear Stearns.", "Raj Denhoy  - Piper Jaffray", "I wanted to talk a little more on resurfacing. One of thequestions that has come up with that product is whether it is going to beincremental to the market growth, or whether it's going to be cannibalizingexisting sales. It sounds from your commentary that you are thinking it's goingto be more the latter, and that it should be taking procedures that would havebeen done with traditional hips. Is that fair to say? Do you think it'ssomewhat of a mix here at this point?", "David Dvorak", " Well, I think it isboth. I think that it is probably expanding the market, but also picking upsome opportunities that otherwise would have gone to traditional hipprocedures. We are seeing it obviously on the side where the traditional hipprocedure is being lost to the resurfacing but in addition to that, I think itis also the case that when the surgeons go in and get trained on theresurfacing product, you may lose the primary total hip procedure even if theyare not using the resurfacing, because they have been exposed to anothercompany's product at that point in time.", "Raj Denhoy  - Piper Jaffray", "So it does sound that this could be somewhat longer term, ina sense that you might actually be losing surgeons competitively here?", "David Dvorak", "Well, procedures.", "Raj Denhoy  - Piper Jaffray", "But not actually the surgeon shifting their entire businessover to another competitor?", "David Dvorak", "We haven't seen a lot of that but we probably have seen someprocedure loss, and in instances, some of the primary business.", "Raj Denhoy  - Piper Jaffray", "You continue to buy back stock here at a pretty good rate.Obviously there has been a lot of commentary about reinvesting your businessand looking for opportunities to accelerate some of the product lines in the spine,trauma, and other areas. Perhaps could you just talk a little bit about theopportunities for investment in the business? Are there programs that are nowstarting to come up? Are you looking for more things to invest in? Are youlooking more aggressively outside? I guess the level of investment, and alsothe urgency at which you are going to be tackling these things, and reallytrying to reaccelerate the business here?", "Jim Crines", "We certainly are focused on opportunities outside and inside.As we think about inside, obviously, we have talked specifically about thekinds of investments we are already making in dental, talked about trauma andthe issues around sales focus, and our intention to invest there. ", "As we look on the outside we will as we always have, applysome fairly rigid criteria to those opportunities. We are looking for thingsthat have good strategic fit, that keep us within musculoskeletal health, anydeals that we would look at, pay a lot of attention to as we model out theopportunities -- accretion, dilution, diligent IP, as we have said, the focuswe have on spine, dental, biologics, particularly in the spine area, that getsto be an issue. ", "Appropriate valuations gets to be an issue, and we focus, asyou can well imagine in this environment on compliant business practices. So weare active, and will remain active in exploring opportunities on the outside,subject to the discipline that I described.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Matson - WachoviaSecurities.", "Michael Matson  - Wachovia Securities", "With regard to the changes in compliance practices and thefederal monitor, obviously you talked about the charges that the federalmonitor is going to result in. But are there going to be any hits toproductivity from your other employees in terms of having to  spend more time tracking their work withconsultants, and spending on entertainment, things like that? Is there anypossibility that those sorts of things could put some pressure on your marginsas well?", "Jim Crines", "Well, I think that as far as the expenses that relate tocompliance with the deferred prosecution agreement, what we outlined in the wayof incremental expense is going to be the most significant, and that is themonitoring costs.", "We have a fairly significant investment and are constantlyexpanding that to ensure that we are meeting the needs, so I can't tell youwith any precision at this point in time what that will look like for 2008, butany of those incremental expenses that will relate to the fourth quarter arebaked into our guidance.", "Michael Matson  - Wachovia Securities", "Just with regard to the guidance, you said January. Doesthat mean you are going to give it on your fourth quarter call? Is that whatyou are saying?", "Jim Crines", " That is correct.", "Michael Matson  - Wachovia Securities", " How big of a deal isit, in your view, probably early next year you are going to have the oldestknee platform on the market with the launch of DePuy's new Sigma Knee? Obviouslyyou have Gender, but let's be frank, it seems like that has been prettydisappointing. It is really more of a line extension than a completely new kneesystem. Are there plans to launch a new knee, and is that going to causefurther pain next year?", "David Dvorak", "We continue to have the number one knee system on themarket, and we are excited about many of the introductions that are coming out.We have outlined those with specificity. We think that we are going to be ableto get good traction out of Gender. We think that the Natural-Knee Gender Flexoffering is going to be meaningful in 2008, so we have a good lineup, includingthe mobile bearing opportunity, provided we get the FDA clearance on that.", "Michael Matson  - Wachovia Securities", "With regard to the reinvestment that you talk about in the spineand trauma businesses, is that going to be primarily in R&D, SG&A, orsort of spread across both areas?", "David Dvorak", " It is going to bespread across different areas, depending upon which of those divisions. Thereare instances where we have a pretty full product line in some of thosedivisions; others where we have some gaps that we are looking to fill.Obviously those gaps in the trauma area we have talked about some internaldevelopment efforts there.", "On the spine side, it is going to be a combination ofinternal and external developments. We are looking to develop critical mass inall those business divisions. More feet on the street is going to be necessaryto accomplish that objective as well.", "Michael Matson  - Wachovia Securities", "In your hip product category,  I guess about a year ago you were rolling outyour large diameter metal-on-metal hip. I was just wondering if you could giveus any kind of an sense of where things stand with the penetration of thatproduct, because I guess we had thought that would be sort of a mix driver,because some of the other companies, that percentage, it is gotten to be 30% ormore.", "David Dvorak", "We continue to see, as I indicated in my comments,significant growth with that large diameter head metal-on-metal product line, Ithink I had indicated in my scripted comments that we saw an increase withinthe Metasul brand of over 50% in the quarter. So we are still ramping that uplevel of penetration, and I would tell you it is not at the levels that you,not yet at the levels that you quoted with respect to competition.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Robert Faulkner - ThomasWeisel.", "Robert Faulkner  - Thomas Weisel Partners", "I want to dig in a little bit on the guidance, and just askwhat in your mind changed from last quarter at this time to now? Resurfacingwas out there. Some of your constraints were visible. Maybe they became moreprofound, and the comparisons were also known. So is this a function of becomingmore familiar with the operations in forecasting dynamics, or did somethingreally jump out this quarter, learning that resurfacing was worse, et cetera?", "David Dvorak", "The point that you raised is a contributor, I will tell you.I think that we are learning more specifically as to how effective we are doingin some of these different product areas on the execution side, and where weare challenged on the product offering side. ", "The short statement to that is really the expectedacceleration on the Americasside, hips and knees both, wasn't there at the levels that we anticipated it.Now we think there are good opportunities going forward, and we think that weunderstand what we need to do with a fair amount of specificity at this pointto fully exploit the opportunities that we have in the marketplace with ourcurrent offering.", "But it is a degree of familiarity, and not finding thetraction. We talked specifically as well about the selling on the next-genGender side, and as we move into this fourth quarter, and start to overlap onthe mix benefit that we enjoyed a year ago, obviously if we are not taking thecompetitive business at the levels that we originally had forecasted, thatgrowth starts to fall off on the year-over-year comparisons.", "Robert Faulkner  - Thomas Weisel Partners", "In terms of the acceleration, was that more of a forecastingdynamic? I think you maybe mentioned earlier one particular product that wasn'tdoing what you expected, or is there a real product inside the hip businessthat isn't accelerating the way you thought it would be?", "David Dvorak", " I think it is acrossthe various lines that we described earlier in the call.", "Robert Faulkner  - Thomas Weisel Partners", "As a follow-up, maybe could you comment on use of cash, orat least let us know how you are thinking about the two alternatives youmentioned. One is acquisitions, the other is share repurchase. How do you thinkabout allocating cash to one versus the other? Do you have a preference?", "Jim Crines", " I would tell you, webelieve with any of the opportunities we would be looking at in terms ofacquisitions, we have with our balance sheet the opportunity to do whatever weneed to do, whether it is to fund those out of available free cash flow, or ifwe were to need to, draw down on our credit facility, we could do that but otherwiseput available free cash flow to work through our share repurchase program. Franklydon't  see a need to build cash on thebalance sheet.", "Robert Faulkner  - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Finally, the $0.07 to $0.08 that you attributed to operatingdeleverage in the fourth quarter in your guidance, that is a lot of deleverage.It rounds to about I think 50%, unless I am doing the math incorrectly. How doyou think about kind of the impact? Are we back to the old marginal flowthroughargument with that forecast?", "Jim Crines", "What we said on that is $0.08 is specifically attributed tothe $33 million to $38 million reduction in constant currency sales, which wehave said is predominantly talking about our high-margin hip and knee productsales in our Americasbusiness.", "Robert Faulkner  - Thomas Weisel Partners", " The foreign exchangeis hedged, so it affects the whole $38 million?", "Jim Crines", " That is right.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann.", "Jason Wittes  - Leerink Swann", " Another questionabout the monitor expense, is that all external expense, or is there someinternal expense as well? In other words, is all that money going to themonitor, or also some changes being done internally that are part of it?", "Jim Crines", " That is all external.", "Jason Wittes  - Leerink Swann", " In terms of yourGender-Specific Knee outlook, you are lowering it, and I am wondering, is thatjust because the amount of time it is going to take to launch, or is that alsobecause some of the response has been muted, in part due to the fact that atleast a couple of your competitors have responded with what you would calltheir own versions of Gender-Specific?", "Jim Crines", " The latter is thefair way to characterize it. As we have said, we have not seen the competitiveuptake that we had anticipated we would see at this stage. We still believe itis a very unique device, and we have to do a better job of executing to getafter that competitive opportunity.", "We will have further opportunities as we get into the launchof the Gender Flex component for the Natural-Knee, and we get the porouscomponent out for the next-gen line, but to your point, and at least in thefirst nine months of this year, we have been challenged, and in some caseswould acknowledge that competitors have put effective countermeasures in place.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brian Wong - BroadpointCapital.", "Brian Wong  - Broadpoint Capital", "I have just a quick question regarding your distributionagreement with Regeneration Technologies. Just wondering if you could commenton where you are with that? Are you still on track for the fourth quarterlaunch of that product?", "Jim Crines", " Yes. We are workingthrough those logistical details of getting those products launched, and it ispretty much in line with the expectations we had outlined in earlier calls.", "Brian Wong  - Broadpoint Capital", "Can we just get the 30,000-foot view, what do you see as thegrowth rate of the overall market. Is it accelerating? Is it staying the same?Just your thoughts on the overall market in general, please?", "Jim Crines", "The overall market, we don't see changes relative to ourview in the past. I mean, we are still of the belief that on the unit side youare looking at mid-single digit growth, with mix opportunity of 1% to 3%. Ithink that for any of the companies within this industry that have new systemsout, they are probably on the high end of that mix, if they are successfullylaunching those products, maybe even above that. We think that the marketcontinues to be a very attractive market.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Johnson - Robert W.Baird.", "Jeff Johnson  - Robert W. Baird", "Understanding you are not going to '08 guidance at thispoint, but as we look at the $0.07 to $0.08 cut to Q4 from an operationalstandpoint, is it fair to say, given that we are moving some of these productlaunches out a little bit, that we should kind of gauge our '08 number in asimilar manner, as far as the first couple of quarters could see similaroperational impact from these lack of new products, and the loss of Americas hipand knee business?", "Jim Crines", " We will be specificabout that as we provide the 2008 guidance, but clearly the trends that we areforecasting now for the fourth quarter are going to provide a different base tojump off of into 2008, so it is going to have an impact in that regard.", "Jeff Johnson  - Robert W. Baird", " Fair enough. Again,the first half of the year we should think of this as maybe Q4, if that is atrough number, so slowly recovering throughout 2008?", "Jim Crines", "I would appreciate it if you would just bear with us and letus come back to you with the 2008 guidance, and we will give you as muchclarity as possible once we solidify our plans. We are going to be in a muchbetter position to do that intelligently in January.", "Jeff Johnson  - Robert W. Baird", "Fair enough. On the monitoring expenses, sorry to beat thatissue. We have read through the DPA, if it is an 18-month agreement, assumingeverybody complies with everything they are supposed to and what have you, isit fair to think we can kind of punt on '08, as far as the expenses, but as welook into '09 those expenses should go away? Again, assuming full compliance oneverybody's end?", "Jim Crines", " Yes, after the firstquarter of 2009.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Greg Simpson - StifelNicolaus.", "Greg Simpson  - Stifel Nicolaus", "If could I follow up on Rob Faulkner's question on Gender,David, on your question about competitive share, should we take it to assumethat you think you have gained competitive share, but just not at the rate thatyou thought you would, or you don't think you have gained share it at all?", "David Dvorak", " No, we have gained competitiveshare, but you are right to say not at the rate that we thought we would. As weare examining those trends, we look out to the fourth quarter, and as I said, youstart to overlap with that mix benefit that we enjoyed last year, and obviouslywhat we are counting on for acceleration in the year-over-year comparisons ismore competitive.", "Greg Simpson  - Stifel Nicolaus", "Not trying to back-door '08 guidance or anything along thoselines, but with respect to Gender again, if you look at interest level andtraining of competitive surgeons, does it give you a sense of hope, in terms ofgaining additional competitive share as we go forward, but again just not atthe pace you thought? Is that process accelerating?", "David Dvorak", "No, we are still enthusiastic about the opportunity withGender. I think we need to do a better job of executing on that opportunity.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. Are there anyclosing remarks?", "David Dvorak", "Thanks, Jennifer. I just wanted to say thanks to everyonefor joining us today, and for your continued interest in Zimmer. We are lookingforward to speaking to you again on our fourth quarter and full year 2007conference call, which will take place on Tuesday, January 29 at 8:00 a.m. Have a good day.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

(ZMH) Q4 2007 Earnings Call January 29, 2008  8:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Sean O'Hara - Associate Director IR and Strategic Planning", "David Dvorak - President and CEO", "Jim Crines - EVP Finance and CFO", "Analysts", "Raj Denhoy - Bear Stearns", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "Michael Jungling - Merrill Lynch", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan", "Mark Mullikin - Piper Jaffray", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank", "Steven Lichtman - Banc of America Securities", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company", "Bill Plovanic - Canaccord Adams", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Bruce Nudell - UBS", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "David Toung - Argus Research", "Sean O'Hara", "Good morning, I am Sean O'Hara, Associate Director of Investor Relations and Strategic Planning. I would like to welcome you to the Zimmer fourth quarter and full year results conference call.", "Joining me today to host this call are David Dvorak, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Crines, Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer. This morning we will review our performance for the quarter, present our outlook for 2008 and conclude our discussion with a question-and-answer session.", "Before we get started I would like to point out that this presentation contains forward-looking statements, within the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the orthopedics industry, management's beliefs, and assumptions made by management. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.", "For a list and description of the risks and uncertainties, see the disclosure materials filed by Zimmer with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Zimmer disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.", "This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of such information to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, along with other financial and statistical information for the periods to be presented on this conference call was included in the press release announcing our earnings, which may be accessed on the Zimmer website at zimmer.com, under the section entitled Investor Relations.", "At this time I would like to introduce David Dvorak, President and Chief Executive Officer of Zimmer.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you Sean and good morning everyone. Today I would like to briefly review the results of the quarter. We are pleased about these overall results especially the strength of sales across geographic segments. I will spend a few minutes giving you our outlook for both Zimmer and the industry in 2008. Also I will outline some important programs we plan to institute in infrastructure operations and elsewhere, which we believe will prepare the company for an even more exciting future.", "First let's review our fourth quarter results. Consolidated sales for the quarter of $1.73 billion were up 15% over the prior year, 10% in constant currency and we delivered 16% growth and adjusted earnings per share.", "Our sales results reflect improvement in nearly every product category and all geographic segments and also include the effect of recent acquisition supporting our Spine and Dental businesses. Based on the already reported results of other market participants, it would appear that market growth accelerated in the fourth quarter and we are particularly pleased to see how our supply chain and our sales and distribution networks around the world were able to respond to this growth in procedures.", "The fourth quarter's strong finish caped off an eventful year for Zimmer. With respect to our financial results for the full year, we grew sales 12% over the prior year, 9% in constant currency, and grew adjusted earnings per share 18%.", "During the year we made progress on some of our key strategic priorities by expanding our Gender Solutions product offering and adding products from Endius and ORTHOsoft to our portfolio.", "We also continued our strong record of cash flow generation and used over $576 million to repurchase 7.2 million shares in 2007. Jim will discuss these results in greater detail, later in the call.", "Now, to our 2008 outlook: We developed our 2008 guidance, taking to account our assessment of the market and the opportunities and risks that could impact our performance.", "I will now take you through our expectations for sales and earnings. First, looking at the market for our core reconstructive product categories and geographies, we entered 2008 with positive momentum and underlying market demand for orthopedic devices.", "While company reports are in for 2007, we expect the results will indicate that the global reconstructive market grew in the range of 8% to 10%. We continue to believe this reflects mid-single digit growth in procedures with a balance. This is due to mix and flat to modest price improvements. We anticipate similar market dynamics in 2008 and slightly higher market growth rates for spine, trauma, dental and extremities, consistent with recent trends.", "Our outlook calls for top-line growth for the year of 10% to 11% net sales, on a reported basis, and adjusted earnings per share of $4.20 to $4.25. Sales will be driven by new product introductions and further market penetration by key products launched in 2007, as well as the positive effect of a weaker U.S. dollar abroad.", "We attribute approximately two points of sales growth in our range to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Several important elements of our product portfolio will impact top line results in 2008.", "In our two largest product categories, Knees and Hips, we see the introduction of certain new products as key drivers for the performance this year. We are experiencing a nice stream of new product in Knees this year. We anticipate that the further extension of our Gender Solutions brand and performance of our Mobile Bearing Knee will provide the stimulus to meet or exceed market growth within our Knee franchise.", "In Hips, we're working to address a range of mix opportunities. Our new M/L Taper with connective technology product should enhance our competitive position in 2008 and beyond. Although we don't believe we are experiencing unit share losses. Because of these factors we expect to continue to track behind the market on a dollar basis until these mix opportunities are fully addressed.", "Now to our reconstructive group: We expect both Dental and Extremities to continue their strong performance and we anticipate it growing at or above market rates in 2008. We expect spine will benefit in 2008 as it did in the fourth quarter from the complete integration of NDS products. We'll continue to look for fill-in acquisitions that can enhance our spine portfolio.", "Finally in Trauma: We still have some work to do to capitalize on the opportunities in that market. We expect that our renewed focus on the sales effort will help to improve our performance as we continue to work on addressing key product gaps going into 2009.", "As we continue to drive the top line in 2008, we also plan to implement a number of significant infrastructure and operating initiatives that will position us to respond to the growing medical needs of an ageing population. Recent studies indicate that the baby-boomer generation will contribute a 40% increase in arthritis over the next two decades.", "We believe that investing today in the infrastructure needed to serve the healthcare market of the future will generate attractive returns in the years to come. For example, moving beyond this year to 2009, we expect to return to at least low double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share.", "Jim will provide further details on the impact of these initiatives, our 2008 earnings, and modeling inputs during this call.", "I will now turn to what I determine will be a priority of the highest level for the company. With the passage of four months since signing the Deferred Prosecution and Corporate Integrity Agreements, the continued enhancement of our corporate compliance program is progressing.", "We are focused on meeting our obligations under the operational provisions of these resolution agreements and we have embraced the opportunity to make a broader commitment to the ongoing improvement of compliance and business practices that will position us for greater growth.", "The terms of the resolution agreements build upon the foundation and incorporated key features of our enhanced compliance program, which we began developing in 2004 and implemented in 2005. The work we have undertaken to address the additional requirements of these resolution agreements has revealed an exceptional opportunity to provide a benchmark of compliance, transparency and patient centrism for the industry.", "We will focus initially on three key priorities as we begin to execute a strategy that moves beyond the requirements of the resolution agreements and positions Zimmer to lead in this important area. First, we are reviewing existing consulting agreements to ensure that they are consistent with the fair market-value principles which are a cornerstone of our 2005 corporate compliance programs.", "Second, we'll continue to move beyond the Hip and Knee segments of our business with an even more robust enterprise-wide program. And third, we'll enhance our efforts to consistently align all business units throughout the world behind best practices and new standards.", "As with any situation in which someone steps forward to initiate change, we anticipate that we may face certain challenges. Nevertheless, we'll carry forward these initiatives, because we believe it's the right thing to do for our company and the industry as a whole. In all cases we commit the fair treatment of our collaborators and we'll endeavor to work with stakeholders to embrace these enhanced compliance initiatives.", "Fundamentally, we believe these changes will allow us to continue to deliver industry-leading products, backed by business practices that inspire confidence and trust. As a market leader, it makes sense to us that our leadership position should extend to include innovation in the area of compliance.", "Finally, the new initiatives will make it possible for us to focus entirely on what we do best, bringing to market products that enhance patients' lives. At this point Jim will provide some further details on the quarter and our 2008 guidance. Jim?", "Jim Crines", "Thanks David. I will review our performance in the quarter in more detail, and then provide some additional information related to our guidance, infrastructure and operating initiatives.", "Sales of $1.73 billion for the quarter represent an increase of 15% reported and 10.2% constant currency. These results reflect a sequential 240 basis point increase in constant currency growth and more broad based. Growth in the quarter was stronger than anticipated, reflecting an increased underlying procedure demand in the quarter, which was most evident for us in U.S. and Europe knees sales.", "The weaker U.S. dollar, compared with the prior year added 4.8% or $44.9 million in revenue in the quarter, approximately $11 million ahead of our previous estimates. Our hedging program resulted in the recognition of greater losses on foreign exchange contracts, which are reported in the cost of products sold. The impact on gross margin in the quarter accounted for the greater part of the decline in margin, compared to both the prior year and prior quarter.", "As expected, consolidated price was flat for the quarter. In the Americas, pricing contributed a point to growth in the quarter. In Europe price was a point negative. Germany, UK and Italy reported negative price of 4.1%, 1.7% and 0.7% respectively, while other markets in Europe were flat or slightly positive. Asia Pacific results include a negative price of 1.8%, driven by negative 4.7% in Japan, and offset by flat to positive prices in other Asia Pacific markets.", "Turning to our revenue growth by major category, worldwide reconstructive sales increased 15.3%, and reported a 10.2% constant currency, up a 150 basis points from the third quarter. Knee sales lead by the ongoing introduction and launch of our NextGen Gender Solutions Knee improved 10.2%.", "Pricing on a global basis was flat for the quarter. Flex knees accounted for 47% of our knees units on a global basis, consistent with third quarter. Achieving these results in quarter one, Flex penetration remained at prior quarter levels. This is a sign that increased investment in field inventory and instrument deployments across our entire knee portfolio is already having a positive impact.", "In other knee systems, Zimmer Uni LCCK, as well as our Prolong highly Crosslinked Polyethylene grew in double digits. We launched the Gender Solutions Natural-Knee Flex in the quarter, and that has curbed some of the competitive pressure on that product line.", "Geographically, in the fourth quarter, our Knee sales in constant currency increased 9.6% in the Americas, 10.3% in Europe, and a very strong 13.3% in Asia Pacific. Hip sales increased 6.7% in the quarter, reflecting a volume and mix increase of 7.7%, offset by a decrease in average selling prices of 1%. Growth in bone cement cells for the fourth quarter accounted for approximately 100 basis points, as did the volume mix increase for hips.", "These results reflect steady growth across our primary hip portfolio, including porous primary stems, total cups and bone cement. Our TM primary, M/L Taper, and EPOCH stems all experienced double-digit growth, offset in part by lower sales of our VerSys Fiber Metal MidCoat, Beaded 6 inch FullCoat, and other cemented stems. TM Modular Cups and Durom and Acetabular component sales reported strong growth, as did Metasul large-diameter heads, with the Metasul brand, realizing over 37% reported growth in sales in the quarter on a relatively small base.", "Bone cement sales increased 47% in the quarter on a geographic basis, and in constant currency. Hip sales increased 9.2% in the Americas, with bones cement accounting for 2.5 points of that growth, 4.7% in Europe and 3.9% in Asia Pacific, inclusive of negative price of 3.3%. Extremity sales for the quarter and constant currency increased 30.1%, on a challenging comp of 23.7% in the fourth quarter of 2007. Extremity sales increased 34.7% in the Americas, 19.1% in Europe, and 21.6% in Asia Pacific.", "Dental sales continue to grow in double digits at 24.2% for the quarter on a prior year comp of 24.3%. Dental sales increased 7.2% in the Americas, and 63.5% in Europe, including the effect of the distributor acquisition in Italy, which closed in the second quarter. Dental sales increased 11.9% in Asia Pacific.", "Trauma sales in the quarter were up over the prior year period at 6.2% constant currency. This growth is up sequentially as we bring greater focus to the sales efforts supporting our trauma product line. We expect this growth to continue to lag the market, and mainly lower sales of Intramedullary Nails, and compression hip screws. Trauma sales in the quarter increased 4.3% in the Americas, 8.9% in Asia Pacific, and 9.2% in Europe.", "Spine sales saw a nice sequential improvement from the third quarter, at 17.8% over the prior year fourth quarter. This was lifted by sales of Thoracolumbar Outerbody fusion products, Interbody Spacers, and Dynesys. Spine in the Americas was up 15.1%. Europe increased 27.6%, and Asia Pacific was up 45.6% on a small base. Finally, Orthopedic Surgical products and Other sales grew 6.6% in the quarter, up 3.9% in the Americas, 11.4% in Europe, and 10.8% in Asia Pacific over the prior year period.", "Now, let me focus on the rest of the income statement. Our adjusted gross profit margin of 76.4% for the quarter reflects a 140 basis point decrease in prior year, and a sequential decline of a 150 basis points from the third quarter. The decrease in margin is mainly attributable to the impact of foreign currency hedges and geographic sales mix.", "R&D expense increased 12% to $51 million for the quarter, indicating higher spending for new product development across all product segments. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to $401 million, up 16% to the prior year and they include monitor fees and expenses and higher instrument costs in the quarter. SG&A expenses were also impacted by dilution from the ORTHOsoft acquisition, which closed in November.", "Acquisitions, integration, and other amounted to $15.7 million in the quarter, and comprised principally of costs pertaining to 2007 acquisitions, and including an IPR&D charge and contract termination liabilities related to the ORTHOsoft transaction. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased 9.8% to $367.9 million. At 34.3%, our adjusted operating profit to sales ratio decreased by 160 basis points from prior year, as a result of the lower gross margin and higher SG&A cost.", "Interest income for the quarter amounted to $1.1 million. Adjusted net earnings increased 12.5% to $276.1 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 15.7% to $1.18, on $234.8 million average outstanding diluted shares. These adjusted earning per share are inclusive of approximately $0.05 of share-based compensation. At $1.12, reported diluted earnings per share increased 9.8% on prior year reported EPS of $1.2.", "Let's now turn to our tax rate at 25.1% adjusted for the quarter and 27.5% for the year. The effective tax rate improved, relative to expectations, principally, as a result of higher earnings in profit from our non-US operations. As indicated in the fourth quarter, weighted average diluted shares outstanding were $234.8 million. During the quarter, we repurchased 1,624,000 shares at a total purchase price of $116 million, or an average price per share of $71.23. During 2007, we repurchased 7.2 million shares at the total purchase price of $576.2 million.", "As of December 31, 2007, we have remaining capacity to repurchase up to $621 million of stock under our repurchase program. For us, in the absence of significant demands on our cash, stock repurchases remain an effective and efficient use of available free cash-flow.", "Operating cash-flow for the quarter amounted to $408.3 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter increased to $62.4 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $107.2 million, including $32.3 million for instruments and $74.9 million for property, plant, and equipment, and with $19 million related to infrastructure initiatives.", "Free cash-flow was $301.1 million for the quarter. Operating and free cash-flow includes approximately $23 million related to delayed payments under various contractual arrangements with healthcare professionals or institutions.", "Finally, inventory days on hand finished the quarter at 258 days, a decrease of 19 days from prior year, reflecting a higher cost of goods and strong underlying demand in the quarter. Our trade accounts receivable days' sales outstanding finished the quarter at 52 days, an 8 day improvement to prior quarter, and 3 days better than prior year.", "Now, I would like to expand upon our guidance for this year and comment on our philosophy in this regard. Guidance reflects our outlook for the year, based on a thorough evaluation of detailed business units and corporate operating plans. We are changing our approach by only issuing full year guidance. We want to guide the street, as we run the business, which is with the longer-term perspective and accountability for annual performance.", "For 2008, we will provide some more detailed guidance with regard to our spending plans and also share with you our thinking on margins and expense ratios. This should give you more information then you have had in the past to help with your models. We hope for now this will strike the right balance between your need for detail and our desire to stay focused on our longer-term goals and objectives.", "As David, mentioned after reviewing market dynamics and our relative opportunities and risks, we expect to deliver 10% to 11% top line sales growth in 2008 and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.20 to $4.25. As always, our guidance and assumptions exclude the effect of potential future acquisition or other unforeseen material business event.", "Taking a closer look at sales expectations, we anticipate approximately 200 basis points of growth to come from foreign currency and as we have pointed out in the past our hedging program essentially neutralizes the impact of FX to our bottom line. Therefore, our sales guidance assumes a constant currency growth rate of 8% to 9% for the year. This is a step down when compared to the fourth quarter, as we will be up against some tougher comps and continuing challenges in Hips in particular.", "Earnings guidance for 2008 reflects the expected costs for a number of ongoing infrastructure and operating initiatives referenced in our press release. As David, indicated these initiatives are needed to serve the healthcare market of the future. Earnings guidance also includes dilution related to the ORTHOsoft acquisition and incremental monitor fees and related compliance expenses.", "Working down through the P&L, we anticipate our consolidated gross margins to be in a range of 76% to 77%, most likely in the middle of that range consistent with our fourth quarter results. Compared with the full year 2007, this is a sequential step down due to two principle factors. In 2008, we are facing increased manufacturing costs due to higher material and quality cost. With foreign currency bolstering the top line, we anticipate further losses under our foreign currency hedging program.", "We are also in the process of finalizing plans to accommodate at least 100,000 square feet of additional international manufacturing capacity and consolidating distribution in Europe. The rationale for expanding now is to diversify our manufacturing network and reduce risk, take advantage of possible lower tax jurisdictions, and prepare our supply chain for increased future unit volumes globally.", "At the same time, our product portfolio has grown in size and complexity, and for example, contains an increased number of PMA Class III devices. Due to these circumstances, we are also upgrading our quality systems infrastructure to ensure Zimmer product quality is never compromised.", "Moving along to R&D, you should expect R&D expenditures consistent with 2007 between 5% and 6% of revenue and here as well most likely in the middle of that range. Now, as we go to SG&A, I will outline the impact of monitor fees and related compliance expenses, as well as the infrastructure and operating initiatives.", "To start, as disclosed previously, we anticipate $0.02 to $0.03 per quarter in SG&A expenses related to external monitoring. We also will be implementing the compliance related initiatives that David described and had planned in some additional expenses for these efforts.", "We will be absorbing on a full year basis $0.03 of dilution related to the ORTHOsoft acquisition, as previously disclosed. We are making necessary investments to our global IT systems. Since our spin-off in 2001, we run our businesses on multiple IT platforms. In 2007, we kicked off a global initiative to build out a single global IT platform on SAP.", "As we enter 2008, we plan to implement SAP in our Asia Pacific operating segment. Also, we are upgrading our field base U.S. inventory and instrument tracking systems on the same SAP platform. This would allow us to drive further efficiencies in operations and improve sales force effectiveness. Our guidance includes implementation as well as ongoing infrastructure costs related to this project.", "As we have mentioned throughout 2007, we intend to position our field base sales and distribution networks to more effectively respond to changes in daily surgery demand patterns as well as new business opportunities. This necessitates an increase in instrument deployments and the amortization of these investments is reflected in SG&A.", "Finally, to capitalize on growth opportunities with our smaller business units, we are investing in 2008 in sales force, instrumentation and other selling expenses related to our Spine, Dental and Trauma business units. Altogether with monitor fees and related compliance expenses, as well as the cost for the various infrastructure and operating initiatives, we expect SG&A for 2008 to fall within a range of 39% to 40% of sales and likely to be in the middle of that range.", "Below operating profit, we anticipate a tax rate of around 28.5% above our final rate for 2007, due a higher mix of earnings and profits from higher tax jurisdictions in 2008. As we mentioned on our third quarter call, in the absence of any changes to sourcing, we would anticipate upward pressure on our consolidated tax rate over time.", "Our planed manufacturing expansion outside the U.S. should provide us with the opportunity to counter this upward pressure and maintain, and possibly lower our effective tax rate after we get the increased international capacity online. We anticipate weighted average shares outstanding for 2008 to be approximately 234 million shares.", "When we derive at our GAAP earnings per share, you should assume subtracting acquisition, integration and other costs of approximately 27 million, when estimated at $0.08 per share. Turning to cash flow, we anticipate capital expenditures in the range of 470 million to 500 million, reflecting the capital components of many of our 2008 infrastructure and operating initiatives already detailed. Instrument capital in 2008 will be in a range of 155 million to 170 million. Traditional PP&E is expected to be in a range to 315 million to 330 million, including a 100 million for infrastructure and our international manufacturing expansion.", "Estimated depreciation and amortization expense for the year is in a range of 260 million to 280 million. As we have indicated in the past, we expect to continue to apply available free cash flow towards stock repurchases. We continue to monitor our cash flow against the other strategic priorities and if we are unable to find opportunities to meet strategic and other criteria, we will consider either increasing or accelerating our repurchase activity.", "David, I'll turn the call back over to you.", "David Dvorak", "", "Thank you, Jim. This is an exciting time at Zimmer. We believe that 2008 will be an extremely productive year, as we strive to execute three major priorities. First, meet or exceed our stated goals for financial performance.", "Second, implement the infrastructure and operational initiatives that will prepare Zimmer to participate in the future growth of the market in a significant way. And finally, to develop and market exceptional products under compliance standards for collaboration that consistently earn the trust of our stakeholders.", "We pursue these priorities with a commitment to ensure that healthcare professionals will choose our products based on their commitment to provide the best patient care. That's the basis upon which we want to compete and the surest path forward to maximizing shareholder value.", "And with that I would like to now open the call to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions).Your first question will be from the line of Raj Denhoy of Bear Stearns.", "Raj Denhoy - Bear Stearns", "", "Good morning guys.", "David Dvorak", "Hello Raj good morning.", "Raj Denhoy - Bear Stearns", "I wonder if I could just ask briefly, you mentioned I think half way through your comments, about a return to low double-digit earnings growth in 2009. I'm just curious; maybe you could just give us some more detail around that. What expenses particularly in '08 are leveragable and really if you are going and what product initiatives might payoff and better top line growth come 2009?", "David Dvorak", "Yes, we don't intend to go into detailed guidance with respect to 2009 at this point Raj, but we want to give you an indication, that because of the earnings per share projection in our 2008 guidance, that it would be our intension to see improved leverage in the P&L and the go forward year. So, we want to just cash that in terms of at least low double-digit growth in earnings per share in 2009. I think that the one area that one would anticipate is that obviously after the first quarter of 2009 the monitoring expenses would taper off and that will improve margins.", "Jim Crines", "Yeah, Raj this is Jim. There are as well, some one time costs associated with some of the infrastructure initiatives that we will incur in 2008, that will not carry over to 2009. I think as we've indicated we feel very good about our Knee portfolio, and are looking to address some, and mix opportunities on the Hip side as well going into 2009, and all that together we believe will put us in good position to return to as David indicated at least low double-digit earnings growth.", "Raj Denhoy - Bear Stearns", "Okay then just one follow-up. You know one of the questions though has risen over the last several months about to the longer term profitability of the company and what you guys are planning, I guess to fundamentally alter the long standing goal of this $0.03 to $0.50 of every dollar dropping through in profitability. It sort of sounds if I am reading in to what you are saying that, perhaps returning to that outlook in '09 and beyond is really in the cards?", "David Dvorak", "Well we again believe that we are going to be able to restore the leverage in the P&L on a go forward basis and to the extent that we can provide you with definition to that 2009 we believe will return to at least low double-digit earnings per share growth.", "Raj Denhoy - Bear Stearns", "Okay very good, thank you.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you, Raj.", "Operator", "You next question will be from Ben Andrew of William Blair.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "Just wanted to follow up on a couple of those things, you made a comment about investing to serve the healthcare markets in the future. Can you go into a little bit more detail, what you mean specifically by that if you can please?", "Jim Crines", "Yeah Ben, this is Jim. A couple of the infrastructure investments in particular, clearly the manufacturing expansion we have planned outside the US, is a step towards getting the company ready for what we anticipate will be a step up in unit demand, within this market.", "As we march towards the point where baby boomers hit that age, the average age of a total joint replacement patient, which in our history has been around 67 to 68 years old. Those baby boomers today are just this year turning 63. The upgrade, as we go through that, upgrading our quality systems infrastructure investing in the IT platform.", "That's something that we are going to be able to leverage in a number of different ways. Driving out some efficiencies in administrative functions, as well as potentially driving out some efficiencies and the management of the inventory and the instruments, which I think as you know is a key to servicing procedure demand within the hospitals on a daily basis.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "Okay, and what sort of assumption are you making about global price or as much detail as possible there, as we look into '09 and longer time in that same trajectory.", "Jim Crines", "Yeah, this is Jim again Ben. At this point we see no change from what we've been experiencing over the past couple of years, which again is some modest price reductions outside the US, offset by modest price increases inside the US. And I guess when people ask it by price they are often asking as well about mix opportunities. We believe those mix opportunities are still there to the extent that we, or any of our competitors for that matter, bring new and unique devices to the market, particularly those that offer improved patient outcomes.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "Okay and then just two other questions. When you talk about increasing manufacturing outside the US in tax advantaged areas, are you talking Switzerland or are you looking Asia to get a little cost down or can you be more specific?", "David Dvorak", "Well, we are not ready to announce yet a location, I think in the near future we will be, I would tell you that most likely to be in Europe not Asia Pacific.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "Okay, and then finally what is your view of the long term cost savings opportunity with SAP as you get it fully implemented, and when would that be kicking in?", "David Dvorak", "That, it will be a couple of years before we really have the opportunity to leverage that investment, it takes as you can imagine with this kind of initiative, a couple of years before we are able to get through all of the operating segments. As I indicated, we're going to begin with Asia-Pacific in 2008. We'll move on to North America and then Europe following that. So we are a couple of years out before we'll begin to really be able to leverage the investment.", "It's one of the ways in which we pointed out earlier, we're going to look to drive efficiencies through the P&L and return to leveraged growth and earnings per share. Beyond that then it's kind of hard to give specifics at this point.", "David Dvorak", "But I would also say, Ben, that it's obviously a key piece of our infrastructure that will allow us to do future integrations more efficiently and effectively. So that's an important part of our strategy on a go-forward basis as well.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Okay. Thank you.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from Michael Jungling of Merrill Lynch.", "Michael Jungling - Merrill Lynch", "Yes, sir, good morning. I have three questions please. Firstly on SG&A, did your Q4 2007 number benefit from reducing consultancy agreements with doctors? Secondly, on FX contracts using current spot rates, what is the actual headwind to gross margins from foreign exchange contract losses? Thirdly on the share buyback, can you comment on why you did not raise your share buyback program, given the current tough valuations? I don't fully understand that given the excess capital that you currently have. Thank you.", "David Dvorak", "Sure. Michael, thanks for the questions. To respond to your first question, the answer is no, the SG&A expenses were not reduced in anyway by consulting payments. Any payments would have been accrued even if the payments weren't made at that point in time. So there is no impact on our SG&A expenses in that area.", "Jim Crines", "And then, Michael, this is Jim. I'll address the other two questions that you had. First of all, on currency, I guess, we've guided people to think about this by first looking at the lift, we would expect to get on the top line. With respect to 2008, we've indicated that accounts for 200 basis points, so the 10% to 11% growth that we have forecasted.", "And then, to the extent that we've indicated, that gets neutralized on our operating profit line through the hedging program. You could basically apply, do the math, apply our operating profit ratio to that lift and you get a sense of what the headwind is going into 2008. Again, that is something that we have taken into account in the guidance we provided on gross margin.", "On share repurchases, I wouldn't get too focused on a single quarter's activity, as you're hearing on this call, the company has some major infrastructure investments underway. Some of the cash that we'll report out, we have on the balance sheet as of December 31st is not resident here in the US. So, we don't necessarily have access to all that cash to repurchase shares.", "We did, as it turned out in 2007; invest over $500 million -- returned over $500 million of cash to our shareholders through that share repurchase program. So again, I wouldn't get too focused on a single quarter.", "Michael Jungling - Merrill Lynch", "And I have just a very two quick follow-up questions. The gross margin for 2009, will that be impacted by foreign exchange losses based on your current FX hedging program? And secondly, if I look at SG&A divide by sales it does appear if you exclude monitoring charges to be one of the lowest or so that we've seen for many, many years. Can you explain why the SG&A came in so low? Thank you.", "Jim Crines", "Sure. So again, with regard to 2009, currency we do hedge out 18 to 24 months. So there will be some carryover in 2009, but certainly not as significant. Assuming exchange rates don't change from where they are today, the losses that are running through the P&L in 2008 would be more significant than we would expect to see in 2009.", "And then, on SG&A, I think what you're seeing there is more the impact of seasonality within our business. Our fourth quarter does very typically tend to be the lowest -- we kind of experience the lowest SG&A ratio as a percent of sales relative to other quarters within -- particularly relative to the third quarter. So I really don't think you're seeing anything else other than that.", "Michael Jungling - Merrill Lynch", "Because if you see the monitoring chart of the sales, I am guessing $6 million, $7 million, $8 million or so in the fourth quarter. On a like-for-like basis, your Q4 SG&A to sales is meaningfully lower to Q4 of 2006. That really was the question?", "Jim Crines", "Yeah. I would tell you Michael that this maybe something we'll just need to follow-up on after the call. We see -- you take up the -- as you pointed out the $6 million to $7 million, say, of monitoring fees and expenses and I think what you would see is SG&A tracking inline with the top line growth.", "Michael Jungling - Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from the line of Bob Hopkins with Lehman Brothers.", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Hi. Thank you and congratulations on the good results.", "David Dvorak", "Hello Bob.", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Hey, first question to speak would you guys be willing to quantify the extraordinary spending on a pretax basis it's going on in 2008. When you include the monitoring expense, the compliance initiative, the IT systems, and all that's running through the P&L, is there any way that you are going to give us that number?", "David Dvorak", "I think you can get there Bob, if you follow the guidance that we have provided on the expense ratios, and you can do the math. And I think once you get to somewhere in the order of about $100 million of incremental spending including that monitor fees and related compliance expenses.", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Okay.", "David Dvorak", "And as we have indicated some of those will carry over in 2009, and a good portion of them we would expect to go away in 2009.", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. So in terms of thinking about what flows through to 2009, the monitoring expense we know, but away from the monitoring expense what percentage carries over in to '09?", "David Dvorak", "Yeah. It's a little hard to say at this point, but probably safe is to assume that roughly in the order half of that.", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And then one of the question on the [consulting arrangements] and the doctors spend, is it? Would it be a fair assumption, as we model longer term for your company, that those expenses relative to what we saw publicly announced a couple months ago, we'd come down meaningfully as we think about maybe '08 and '09 and 2010, or do you expect the same kind of numbers that we saw publicly announced would be maintained?", "David Dvorak", "I would think that you could anticipate that there would be adjustments. Business needs would dictate those adjustments to a large part Bob, but we may also find ways of supporting medical education for instance in a manner that puts those dollars into the hands of a neutral third party, so there is no appearance at all of an impropriety. So, I wouldn't discount all of those dollars down. Our needs will dictate them. But they may take a bit of different form as we go forward.", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Okay and then one other from me is. It's clear when we have seen J&J and Stryker and Biomet, and now you guys report that there has been an apparent up tick in the orthopedic markets in hips and knees. Are there one or two things that you could point to that it's going to attribute the strength to or is it just surprising you guys as well?", "David Dvorak", "Well I think that it was broad based in our case. We saw an up tick in procedures, not only across the various product lines, but also across our various geographic segments. So, that's really the response. It is a broad based acceleration.", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "But is there one or two reasons why you think or just seeing an acceleration and happy to see it?", "David Dvorak", "Well an acceleration in procedure growth.", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Okay so procedure growth.", "David Dvorak", "Yes, yeah I would tell you Bob in our case although again, we have seen what our competitors have purported. We are seeing within our own business to some degree, the effect of having put out, more instruments and more inventory into the field, and that's putting our sales and distribution networks in a position, to service the increase in demand that we are seeing across the market, and to go after new business opportunities as well.", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Okay and finally just to be clear on the philosophy around guidance. I think you are pretty clear on this. But these are not aspirational goals, these are things that you expect to meet or exceed. Is that correct?", "David Dvorak", "That is correct.", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, thanks very much guys.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you Bob.", "Jim Crines", "You are welcome, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from the line of Matt Miksic, Morgan Stanley.", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "Good morning.", "David Dvorak", "Good morning, Matt.", "Jim Crines", "Hello, Matt.", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks for taking the questions. One point of clarification on guidance, is this $0.08 that's a difference between your $4.20, $4.25 adjusted and $4.12 to $4.17 I guess ex the $0.08. That $0.08 includes what's exactly in there and what's not in there?", "David Dvorak", "Yeah. What's in there, are in the integration costs associated with the acquisitions we've completed in 2007, and costs associated with the centralization of our European distribution.", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "Okay.", "David Dvorak", "And we have multiple distribution centers in Europe, and we're moving towards a central hub, building out a new facility and with that, we'll incur some restructuring costs to either relocate people, or for those people that you see do not relocate to pay severance to those employees.", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Monitoring expenses are in the fore or in that other number, though they're not in that $0.08?", "David Dvorak", "That's correct.", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "And then, another just clarification on guidance, I know you're moving away from quarterly guidance. But just to help us, maybe put together the pace of the year, and the first quarter, I mean in one way to look at this. If you are looking back on the first quarter, based on what you know now, what kinds of things should we be mindful of as we put together our numbers, nuances in the quarter like differences of selling days, price cuts, year-over-year-year comps or new launches that might affect Q1?", "David Dvorak", "Yeah. I think, Matt, similar to what you have seen in prior years out of this business. The same issues around seasonality, obviously, with elected procedures slowing down in the summer months. I would tell you the spending on the infrastructure and operating initiatives as it turns out in the aggregate was likely to play out evenly over the course of the year.", "There are some of those that will hit hard in the beginning of the year and others that would be more active I guess in the back half of the year. So in the aggregate we would expect that spending to take place somewhat evenly over the course of the year. On the pricing front, Japan price reductions April 1st as they typically are, so really no difference related to prior year seasonal patterns.", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "Okay so new cuts as of Jan 1, no unusual comps in any of your business lines that we should be thinking about for Q1?", "David Dvorak", "I guess that the only other thing I would plan out is to the extent we are seeing the effects of acquisitions on our top line in the Spine and Dental businesses. At some point, the back half of the year next year we'll be up against some tougher comps there.", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "It's helpful, one question just on the regulatory front. One of your competitors has been hit by a couple of warning letters from the FDA over the last year or so, just wondering if you can give us any sense of maybe where you are in the cycle of inspections over the past several months, where you stand with the FDA?", "David Dvorak", "We obviously have a variety of different facilities as you know Matt. And so those inspections are taking place on a rolling basis. Jim mentioned, that we have initiatives underway to enhance further our quality systems, that's a significant priority for us as one would imagine and we are going to continue to improve those systems as we go forward. So it's an ongoing commitment in our area, but one that we treat as a major premise to running our business.", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "", "Okay. And then just finally, again to the question of strength in the fourth quarter, you saw broad based strength I think across all your businesses, buts Hips in particular I think across the market have been stronger than expected. This is something you guys are often unwilling to talk about it off label usage.", "As we get more resurfacing products out into the market, many of these products are proved overseas in that sort of well characterized clinical data and results and safety profiles and so on. Is it possible that as these other products rollout from Stryker and Smith & Nephew, that we see just a broader off label use across other manufacturers who have approved OUS products?", "David Dvorak", "That is not part of our business strategy, whatsoever Matt. I mean, we respect the clearances that we have and treat that matter in a very carefully fashion. So we don't anticipate that we are going to participating in the resurfacing market until we have a product that's properly clear.", "Jim Crines", "Matt, this is Jim. I would tell that we don't think we are seeing that at all. In fact I think, I believe there are reimbursement challenges with respect to anyone who would choose to use our product off label and that is frankly, keeping that under tight control across the market.", "I would tell you that in fact, as well examine our Hips results relative to our competitors, and particularly those that are reporting higher dollar growth, one of things that's contributing to our performance relative to their performance is the fact our large diameter head, metal offering has not reached the level of penetration that is at all near what those other companies have achieved with their alternate bearing offerings.", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "Okay and just one last question, just in the past couple of quarters I think it's fair to say that it sounds and looks like you have learnt some lessons in terms of forecasting and providing guidance, and perhaps managing the business as well. I just wanted to ask if there is anything that you see yourself doing differently over the next, you know as you talk about your quarter and your guidance today or going forward based on what you have learnt say in the last nine months?", "David Dvorak", "Well Matt we obviously went through an extremely methodical process to put our 2008 plan together. We described that process broadly to people that we've met have with, and really all of that hard work puts us in a great position and provides us with nice momentum coming out of the fourth quarter. So we're anxious to execute on these plans and optimistic that we're going to have a good year in 2008.", "Jim Crines", "Matt this is Jim. I would just say as I have said before that we really appreciate all the feedback we get from you folks and hopefully you see that we're doing everything we can to respond to that.", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "Great, well thanks I will jump out.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you ", "Operator", "Your next question will be from the line of Kristen Stewart with Credit Suisse. ", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Hi good morning.", "David Dvorak", "Good morning ", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "I was just wondering if we could just plan and take a step back to -- in October you guys have reduced your guidance and one of the things that you had cited was reduction of 33 to 38 I think it was in constant currency growth. What happened I guess relative to your expectations in the month of November and December, I would imagine December is generally a pretty slow month. To really drive the increase in your top line growth, was it just currency and if it was just currency are fully hedged to where it not dropping fairly and you mentioned the SG&A impact obviously but it does any at all fall through to the bottom line?", "David Dvorak", "Okay, I will pass the currency question back over to Jim, but let me just respond to the front end of your question Kristen. I think that what we saw, it was broad based procedure growth that drove across to our various geographies, as well as our business units. And candidly, I think that we also did a better job of exploiting those opportunities. We had better synchronization of our distribution, our manufacturing to take advantage of that, and I think that there were less missed opportunities on our part in the fourth quarter then there may have been in the second and third quarter.", "Jim Crines", "Yeah and on the currency front, Kristen this is Jim. That really contributed a fraction to the over achievement as we indicated in our prepared comments it was $11 million of the over achievement on the top line.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Can you give us a sense just in terms of where currency has been impacting you in the previous three quarters. I know it wasn't obviously as much of a hit but just where that was on the gross margin line?", "David Dvorak", "Yeah, again I guess you would have, I don't have it here in front on me, you'll have to go back over the year and look at what currency has contributed to the top line in total. I think in total, if you look back over the year you will come somewhere to the order of $100 million benefit to the top line, and as I indicated you can get a sense of what's going on with hedge losses, when you consider that we've disclosed that the hedging program effectively neutralizes that top-line benefit by the time you get down to the operating profit line. So you can do the math and get a sense of how that's playing out in the margin.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Wouldn't some of your SG&A and R&D also be impacted obviously by higher foreign exchange rate because the expenses will also be a little higher?", "Jim Crines", "Yes.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "And the last question, just going back to the acquisition, integration and other expenses that you broke out is just about $0.08. What's your general philosophy on kind of how you would exclude this into, I guess outside of the adjusted numbers? What type of expenses are these specifically, and to what degree will they continue going forward?", "Jim Crines", "Yeah. We would look to put into that line any unusual expenses that are sort of one-time in nature and we've done that -- we have done it consistently. And then we would also look to provide very transparent disclosure. You'll see in our periodic filings as to what's included in that line and we will continue to report on that basis.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "And the added distribution, I guess the investments there, will those be similar to what you did in previous quarters with the purchases of distributorship or is this something different?", "Jim Crines", "There we're talking about our own distribution centers, our own logistics, and operations in Europe. We're not talking about not referencing acquisitions made to third-party distributors.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "But aren't those included in the acquisition, integration and other or those within the SG&A line?", "Jim Crines", "Well, just referencing what we were talking about on the call with respect to centralization of our distribution operations in Europe in 2008, that is, as I said that is an effort that involves our own internal logistics operations in Europe.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Maybe I will follow-up in line. Thank you.", "Jim Crines", "", "Sure.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Thank you very much. A couple of questions, the first, have you seen any changes in your business practices with the physicians, now that the DOJ settlement is behind you?", "David Dvorak", "Our business practices are obviously geared towards being completely incompliance with the terms of those resolution agreements. And I would not describe the business practices as it has been changed in material sense.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "And I still need to ask the question in different way, but I am sorry -- which is that, do you feel like there has been some speculation that now that the settlement is behind Zimmer, that the doctors would not be a averse to using Zimmer products, could you sort of comment on that?", "David Dvorak", "Well, I think that as a general matter, all these healthcare professionals are making decisions with respect to products in the best interest of their patients. And we feel very comfortable with the quality of our products and believe that is going to be the basis for competition on a go-forward basis and we're going to be well served in that marketplace.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. In your guidance, do you have a share repurchases plans?", "David Dvorak", "We do. If you look at the average share number that we've provided, you'd probably be able to figure out that. What we've assumed in is a bit more modest than what we experienced in 2007, but as I indicated in our prepared comments to the extent that we don't have other needs for the cash over the course of the year, what we have assumed into our guidance may prove to be a bit conservative.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. And this question has been sort of ask the couple of different ways but I want to really get my arms around that what you said, in the second quarter the company met expectations then guided lower and the third quarter they met expectations and guided lower, and now in the fourth quarter you beat expectations and guided in line with the street. If you had to say what happened between the last conference call and this conference call, could you just put couple of items that may give you some increase confidence in the way the financial guidance is being provided? Thank you.", "Jim Crines", "As David explains, we've had the opportunity to go through, a very detailed review of our business unit and corporate operating plans. We're very pleased frankly with the performance in the fourth quarter relative to our earlier expectations.", "We see our supply chain in our sales and distribution networks. We're responding to the increase that we're seeing in demand across the quarter, that together with the process that we went through give us the confidence that we have going into 2008 that we will meet or exceed the financial targets that we've set for ourselves.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Thanks.", "Jim Crines", "Sure", "David Dvorak", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from Mike Weinstein with J P Morgan.", "Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan", "Thank you. Good morning, guys.", "David Dvorak", "Good morning, Mike.", "Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan", "I think a lot of the questions have already been asked. But, I do want to circle back on some of the questions that were being raised, and the theme that Joanne was pushing you guys on. Are you surprised by the performance in the fourth quarter? The market obviously is healthy. You're not necessarily growing above market, neither hips nor knees, but you're pretty close, looks like inline with the market in knees and maybe slightly below in hips.", "Are you surprised though by your performance could certainly the tone you guys gave one the third quarter call was much more cautious than your tone since then with investors at meeting and so forth was cautious. So, am I right in assuming you're a bit surprised, or how should we characterize your own response for the quarter?", "David Dvorak", "I think that we were surprised by the extent of the procedure growth, and that's obviously a positive surprise. I think that, as I said earlier, Mike that a lot of things have come in the sink. We were able to take full advantage of that up-tick in procedure growth, and we were able to do that across a variety of different business units that were coming in below our expectations in the prior two quarters.", "And so, things came together in a more significant way, and I think that we also saw an earlier payback to some of the investments that we made in the distribution cannel that's Jim has mentioned including inventory and instrument deployments.", "Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan", "And when you say pick-up in procedure growth, do you -- are you talking about Hips and Knees or you are talking across your business? Do you think that there was a fourth quarter pick up in volumes?", "David Dvorak", "Well, primarily in reconstructive procedures that's, because it's three quarters of our business it dictates so much to us. But I'm referencing really the reconstructive business, when I say that.", "Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan", "And you seem to be suggesting that you've got enough of a read on the market to say that you think the market actually picked up in the quarter. Is that, I mean rather than just the Zimmer's own business picked up a quarter, is that right?", "David Dvorak", "It's true, Mike. I think that it's our perspective from our running our own operations, as well as what's been reported publicly.", "Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan", "Based on -- it's being based on the other numbers that have come through so far?", "David Dvorak", "That\u2019s right. It corroborates our view from our own perspective.", "Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan", "Okay. Jim, just one financial cleanup question. The drop in the tax-rate in the quarter, maybe help me understand better what was the one-time benefit there and then you have been suggesting that the tax rate would move up in 2008, but here you are pretty much -- you are actually guiding to below what we had, and you're pretty much guiding to a flat year-over-year. Can you just maybe walk us through both of those?", "Jim Crines", "Sure. What led us to the tax rate down to where we landed at 27.5% for the year was really the strength of our earnings and profits and of our non-US operations. That happened to be particularly strong in the back half for the year, and why it wasn\u2019t factored earlier in the year. That and the fact that frankly, we go through the more detailed robust process at the end of the year that gives us a more precise indication of what our legal entity earnings and profits are on a consolidated basis, and make the adjustments as we did at the end of the year. ", "Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan", "So that's why there was catch up for the year?", "Jim Crines", "That's right, that's sort of the story of 2007 and with respect to 2008 at 28.5% again above where we landed in 2007 and we are forecasting that given the fact that some of the newer products that we have launched that will drive the mix of earnings and profits, or getting sourced out of our US facilities. The net as we indicated that does tend to put some upward pressure on the tax rate.", "Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan", "Lastly, a couple of quick questions here. How much of your cash is in the US right now?", "Jim Crines", "It's roughly about a third of what we have reported on the balance sheet as of December 31, '07.", "Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan", "Okay, and philosophically Jim, your thoughts on taking on either working that down, or taking on debt to increased share repurchase, the company is still against that?", "David Dvorak", "Well Mike, I don't know that we've ever said we are against that. That's something that we would consider. It's clearly not something that we have reflected in the guidance that we provided for 2008.", "Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan", "Okay great thank you.", "Jim Crines", "", "Thank you, Mike.", "", "David Dvorak", "See you, Mike.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from Mark Mullikin of Piper Jaffray.", "Mark Mullikin - Piper Jaffray", "Just a couple of questions on the competitive environment here with one of your competitors having some very well known issues at this point with quality and manufacturing issues. Are you seeing anything in this field indicating that you might begin some share on the large joint side of the business?", "David Dvorak", "", "Nothing of significance in that respect.", "Mark Mullikin - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. And then on some of the smaller component extremities, dental, and spine within the extremities business you put up a string of really strong quarters here. Are there any specific products or geographic expansion, what's driving that?", "Jim Crines", "Mark, this is Jim. I think some of what is driving that is certainly benefiting our reports, and to some extent, I think with that the new products that we've introduced are even driving an increase in usage across the surgeon community. I think this new Inverse/Reverse Shoulder Systems, as I understand it are a bit less challenging with respect to surgical technique.", "So, they are getting greater usage if you will across the surgeon community, and that's driven up market, driven the market higher with respect to the total procedures that are being done. And again, we've launched a couple of new products into that category that have been incorporated such as our Trabecular Metal Technology. And that's really helped to drive the kind of performance you are seeing out of our extremities line.", "Mark Mullikin - Piper Jaffray", "So, is it that this is a product group that Zimmer has that some of the competitors don't, because we've seen some pretty weak numbers out of some of the other shoulder companies, is it basically that you are gaining share because you have that product line?", "Jim Crines", "Well, I think that product is gaining share, and it's extending the market as Jim said, because it in a sense is addressing an unmet clinical need prior to the launch of their product. So, we would expect to continue to do well in that segment.", "Mark Mullikin - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. And then within Spine we're seeing a nice rebound in growth and you mentioned finishing the NDS acquisition, are there any specific products that are driving that growth have you now anniversaried some of the Interbody Fusion Cage, challenges at this point?", "Jim Crines", "That is the truth. On the Spine side, we've anniversaried out some of the losses that we're experiencing on the cage side, and we're just reaching the traction point of adding the Thoracolumbar products that we picked up through the NDS acquisition, as well as the MIS offering with the [TAV E] that is opening doors for us and we're creating some opportunities in that area as well as ongoing expansion of our Denus product family.", "Mark Mullikin - Piper Jaffray", "And how much did acquisitions contribute to the quarter and how much are you factoring into '08 guidance?", "Jim Crines", "", "We haven't provided that detail Mark, and I'm not kind of provide to you on this call. I mean it clearly did contribute on the spine and dental numbers with the dental sales in Europe increasing 65% in the quarter, but in the aggregate it's modest.", "David Dvorak", "It's very modest, and in particular within Spine you would see that and our US numbers and then obviously on the dental side, it was the European distributor. So, you'll see an up tick in the numbers that Jim walked you through earlier in the call.", "Mark Mullikin - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. And then the ORTHOsoft acquisition, where does that fit in to the revenue build?", "Jim Crines", "Yeah, it would be in the, what we refer to us orthopedic surgical products and other sales. There are very modest revenues that come with that. The strategy there is really focused on having that technology available for across actually our entire reconstructive portfolio.", "Mark Mullikin - Piper Jaffray", "And then just one last one on the gross margin line, you are guiding that to be in a bit down in this quarter, it was down quite a bit sequentially. Can you just maybe breakout what are the pressures on the gross margin line is that the FX issue, is that the reinvestments exactly what's pressuring it?", "Jim Crines", "Yeah. Well the most significant issue, is the FX issue that's what contributed to the sequential decline in the fourth quarter, and that carries over into 2008. There are a couple of other things as well that we've mentioned, higher material cost being one specifically on cobalt chrome. We are seeing a significant increase in the price of that material.", "And then there is two other things would be the investments, we are making in quality systems infrastructure that does impact to some degree on cost of goods and that's it..", "David Dvorak", "Startup costs.", "Jim Crines", "Well, I'm sorry there is one other thing that startup costs on the international manufacturing expansion. We'll also run through cost of goods in 2008.", "Mark Mullikin - Piper Jaffray", "Okay, very good. Nice quarter, thanks a lot.", "Jim Crines", "Thank you.", "David Dvorak", "Thanks Mark.", "Operator", "The next question will be from Tao Levy of Deutsche Bank.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks, good morning.", "David Dvorak", "Good morning, Tao.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank", "David, maybe on the dental business, can you give us a sense of how much that distributor added not necessarily in dollars, but you grew there 60% whether maybe half of that growth?", "David Dvorak", "", "It\u2019s a small base business, so insignificant in the scheme of things. I think that the breakout of the different geographies that Jim walked through earlier in the call, provide you with good guidance in that area Tao.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And any thoughts on how we should view sort of the dental business in 2008, just given all the macro environment issues.", "David Dvorak", "Well, we are still optimistic about that segment. It's a business that we've invested in since the time we consummated the Centerpulse transaction in 2003 with good success performance wise, and we will continue to do so. It is one of the areas in the infrastructure expansions -- that of the infrastructure expansions that Jim described earlier, and principally on the sales and marketing side.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank", "But overall in terms of end user trends, consumer trends, I mean, you feel comfortable that still maybe a good growth business this year?", "David Dvorak", "Yeah, we are bullish on it. It became hard because of such an under penetrated market at this point and time, relative to the potential patients that could benefit from those procedures.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And on the hip side, last quarter, you had mentioned that you are a bit nervous on how your hip business is going to perform, not so much by hip resurfacing taking over but by surgeons getting exposed to competitor products, etcetera, now that you've gone through some of that experience maybe in the last few months. Have you seen that take place, have you seen folks, who are trained in the Birmingham you see go away from the Zimmer products?", "David Dvorak", "Well, I think that as we stated earlier on the call as well, we don't believe that we are losing units here. We think that we are missing some mixed opportunities there and the Metal-on-Metal under penetration within the United States that Jim referenced is an example of that. So I think that we're quite comfortable that we're retaining the unit share on that side, but we want to sure up our ability to take full advantage of those mix opportunities. And so, some of the benefits of the product offering on the Taper product with connective technology this year will start to kick in. But then, we have some other programs in the pipeline that we think will help us even in advance of ultimately having a resurfacing product offer for the US marketplace.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay. And you mentioned, you talked about investing in compliance and systems. Do you currently have any issues with the FDA? Any warning letters, that usually takes a few months for those to be posted, that may have been issued?", "David Dvorak", "We don't have any warning letters at this point.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Got you. And then just lastly, on the shares outstanding that you are expecting for next year, it doesn\u2019t look like you are assuming much of a repurchase. Any sense of where that interest income line should shake out then, given assuming limited share repurchases, which you are guiding to?", "Jim Crines", "", "Well, we've given an off a lot detail guidance and I think the one thing we\u2026", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities", "I appreciate that.", "Jim Crines", "So I am going to leave it to you to figure out what it needs to be to get within that 420 to 425.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities", "But that is factored into\u2026", "Jim Crines", "Sure, sure.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Great quarter.", "Jim Crines", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from Steven Lichtman of Banc of America Security.", "Steven Lichtman - Banc of America Securities", "Thank you. Good morning.", "David Dvorak", "Good morning, Steven.", "Steven Lichtman - Banc of America Securities", "Guys, I don't think you mentioned gender hip, maybe I missed it, but is that still a plan launch in 2008?", "David Dvorak", "It is. We've been talking about two different product launches in that category, the M/L Taper with connective technology, which is the one that is beginning to ramp now. In the back half for the year, we would go to potentially a limited release and then extend beyond that with respect to the EPOCH stem that also fits into the gender category.", "Steven Lichtman - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. And then in the terms of the gender knee, any change in the tone out there. On the last quarter call you had mentioned that you need to kind of, sense go back to the drawing board in terms of the message out there DTC etcetera.", "What's the general tone out there on the gender knee?", "David Dvorak", "We've refocused our sales force and I think that we saw some of the benefits of having done so and we have productive fourth quarter in that area. So, we continue to be very optimistic about the performance of our Gender offering on a go forward basis.", "Steven Lichtman - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. You talked, David during your prepared comments about expanding the corporate compliance program, and you said as you initiate change, we anticipate may face some challenges. Can you expand on that, what types of things you will be looking for and what potential challenges were you referring to?", "David Dvorak", "Sure. I think that any time where you are dealing with a dynamic circumstance, different parties that are involved in those changes come at them at different speeds. Principally in our case, I think that we are committing significant resources to ensure that we are in absolute compliance with the resolution agreements, and so that includes, our senior management team and myself on that list.", "So, that is part of what we are referring to, as we are very focused on that. But, it's a key priority, and we are absolutely confident that we are going to work through this transition period, and be able to generate first grade products in a manner that brings about trust and confidence in all the stakeholders involved in that process. We are very optimistic that we are doing the right things, and it's going to serve the company well in the long-term.", "Steven Lichtman - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. And in terms of the gross margin looking forward, it may be qualitative, as we look past '08, can we think about gross margin getting back to the levels that we've seen previously, or some of the issues that you mentioned in terms of cost infrastructure issues that perhaps will last little bit longer than 2008, understanding there are certain one-timers with FX. How should we think about gross margin a little bit longer-term?", "David Dvorak", "Sure. Well, Steve there are so many factors that impact our margins, including price, product mix, and geographic mix. There are clearly some things you could forecast out that would lead you to believe there, we would see improvement in gross margin. Not the least of which is, sort of anniversaring out of the hedged losses, that we've been experiencing and then, leveraging some of these investments that we're making.", "So, one other things that has contributed to even in the phase of very modest price increases, and improvement in gross margin overtime, is our ability to leverage unit growth. And we are making investments as we said, that will put us in a position to leverage unit growth in time. Whether or not we see that in a significant way in '09, as I said here today, I can't really project that.", "Steven Lichtman - Banc of America Securities", "", "And then one quick thing on the fourth quarter, nothing unusual in terms of selling days in the quarter, the fourth quarter?", "David Dvorak", "No.", "Steven Lichtman - Banc of America Securities", "", "Okay. And then, I think that's it from me. Thanks a lot.", "David Dvorak", "Good. Thanks, Steve.", "Jim Crines", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company", "Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions.", "David Dvorak", "Hello, Doug.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen &Company", "Just a couple of quick clean up questions. I think you talked about integration of Endius distribution last quarter being a bit of a drag on spine. Are we past this dynamic at this point or where do we stand on that integration?", "David Dvorak", "Yeah, we out past that dynamic. That was an acquisition Dough that was really geared towards picking up some products that represented holes in our offering prior to the Endius acquisition, Atabe and the title systems in particular. And there were distributors that came along with that, but as you can imagine it was a small company with an independent distributor network, and so there's going to be some displacement. I think we've also picked up some good people through that, but that process is complete at this stage and so what you saw in the fourth quarter should be representative of the benefits that we see in the go-forward time period.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Great, thanks for that. We talked a lot about GSK today already, but I was wondering if it was possible to provide any metrics in terms of whether or not that would demonstrate whether or not you becoming more or not becoming more successful and actually using the product as a way to capture additional surgeons?", "Jim Crines", "", "Well that the metric that we have provided in the past, and continue to provide, is High-Flex penetration, within that primary knee portfolio. As we reported we saw that sort of level out in the fourth quarter at 47%, consistent with where we had seen in the third quarter. Now, we also saw fairly significant up tick in procedure volumes, within the fourth quarter and when we look at growth of that product line relative to some of the other products that was really one of the products that led that growth, and particularly when you look at, if you focus on the growth rate in knee sales in the fourth quarter on Europe relative to the third quarter, we are moving ahead with putting more instruments, more inventory out into the field in Europe, but it is definitely contributing to the up tick and growth we saw in knees.", "David Dvorak", "It also contributed, as Jim mentioned to reversing some negative trends that we have previously been seen in the Natural-Knee product line.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen &Company", "Right. Okay. That's very helpful. And just one last follow-up on the investment you talked about in the instrumentation in the sales force. Is it fair to assume that these investments will result in some sort of multiyear acceleration that would begin in sales in I guess spine, trauma and dental as soon as 2009 or does that usually take a bit longer to actually get a return on that investment?", "Jim Crines", "Well with instrument you actually get to see and as we did in the fourth quarter, you get to see a pretty immediate return. If there are unmet surgery demands, those things will be put to use pretty quickly, and I think we did see some of that in the fourth quarter. So as we move ahead we would expect to see a pretty immediate return on the placement of more instruments and inventory into the field.", "There are other investments that we're making around systems that will help us more efficiently manage those assets in the field, but I think it will be a little longer before we are able to leverage those investments.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen &Company", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot and congrats on a great quarter.", "Jim Crines", "Thank you ", "David Dvorak", "Thanks Dough.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from Bill Plovanic of Canaccord Adams.", "Bill Plovanic - Canaccord Adams", "Great, thank you. Just a few questions, clarification questions for me here. First of all just in terms of the double-digit earnings growth '09 off of '08 is that off of the 420 to 425 guidance?", "David Dvorak", "That's correct.", "Bill Plovanic - Canaccord Adams", "Okay. And then the point of clarification, and I think Bob asked the question of a 100 million in incremental spend for 08, if I actually take that $100 million as your current tax rate that\u2019s about a $0.30, am I in the ballpark and thinking about what the GAAP earnings would be?", "Jim Crines", "Well I wouldn\u2019t use that, the $100 million is not something we referenced in reconciling between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings.", "Bill Plovanic - Canaccord Adams", "Okay. What is that number in terms of that we should reference for non-GAAP and GAAP earnings?", "Jim Crines", "Yeah, the $27 million or $0.08 in 2008 is what we have forecasted for the acquisition, integration and other costs.", "Bill Plovanic - Canaccord Adams", "And that includes monitoring and everything?", "Jim Crines", "No, it does not, the monitor the $100 million embedded within the $420 million to $425 million. It\u2019s embedded in the adjusted earnings per share.", "Bill Plovanic - Canaccord Adams", "Okay. Alright, that\u2019s all I have. Thank you", "Jim Crines", "Okay.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from Michael Matson of Wachovia Capital Markets", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I haven\u2019t heard a lot of questions about your acquisitions strategy, so I thought I would revisit that. I just wanted to see looking out at 2008, if you are still targeting the sort of $100 million to $400 million range that you've talked about in the past?", "Jim Crines", "You shouldn\u2019t start that as a reference point I think going forward Michael. I think with respect to our merger and acquisitions strategy, we again think that we have a great portfolio of businesses, and one of the reasons that we like to mix the businesses that we have now is, many of the acquisitions that we do such as an ORTHOsoft we feel like we can leverage that to the advantage of all those different business units. So that\u2019s going to be beneficial to hips, knees, to spine and we'll take it to other business units over the time as well.", "Our priorities going forward will continue to be in a category of fill-in acquisitions, for spine, dental we like that space as we talked about on this call and we would like to expand critical mass within the dental marketplace. And of course, biologics we believe that these solutions will be wave of the future, and so we continue to be interested in exploring opportunities there. It's not limited to those three categories, but those are principle categories that organize our proactive efforts at this point in time.", "Our criteria really hasn't changed from our past discussions, strategic fit is of the up most importance to us. We've an organization that I think has done enough, especially through the Centerpulse integration, to understand how much work these transactions take. We want to make sure that through all those efforts in spending the capital, that we are going to get a good return for our shareholders, and so we are very financially disciplined in the approach that we take to these acquisitions.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Alright. And then, with regards to the monitoring in the enhanced compliance practices, the changes that you are making in your hip and knee business, you said you are also doing that in the spine and trauma, and dental and other businesses. Is that because the settlement requires you to do that, or is that something you are just taking upon yourselves to go ahead and do. And it sounds like some of your competitors may or may not be doing that, I just wondered what your thoughts are?", "David Dvorak", "It's really the latter Michael, the resolution agreements don't compel us to take those steps. But, we are embracing this process, we want to ensure that we are developing the very best practices in this area, and obviously as we make principle decisions around how these collaborative relationships are structured and organized, those principles are going to be equally applicable across our various business lines and across our various geographic segments. So it's our initiative in that respect.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Okay. And then you mentioned in the prior question that the flex penetration globally was 47% I assume. Can you give us what the breakdown is between the US and international markets?", "David Dvorak", "", "I will tell you that it's lowest in Europe; it's pretty high already in Asia Pacific, because that goes back to the development and launch of our very first High-Flex knees. They were designed initially for the Japanese markets. So our levels of penetration are higher in Asia-Pacific -- much higher in Asia-Pacific than they are in Europe and they are higher in the US than they are in Europe. And I will leave it at that.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Markets", "", "Okay. But there is -- you still think that there is room to drive increased penetration in the US?", "David Dvorak", "", "I think there is room in the US and I think there is even more room in Europe.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Okay. That's all I have got. Thanks a lot.", "David Dvorak", "Okay. Thank  you.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from Bruce Nudell from UBS.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS", "Good morning. Thank you. Could you guys provide a little more granularity with regards to your market expectations for units in US hips, US knees \u2013 O-US hips and O-US knees, just what kind of range you might see for hips and knees in those geographies?", "David Dvorak", "", "Yeah, right. Bruce, we have talked about the market in global terms, and unit growth being at around mid-single digits. We have not really broken it down by geography. It's probably a bit higher in US than it is in Europe. But again, on a global basis we see the market continuing to grow in mid-single digits and then we would have mix to modest price improvements accounting for the balance of growth to get to a market that we see growing an 8% to 10%, and understanding as well that at least with respect to the US we do see Hip resurfacing, accelerating growth in the US Hip market.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS.", "So, if I were to just kind of as for planning purposes say like US Hip is around 5% units OUS Knees around 7% or 6% units. Would that be in the kind of ballpark that you guys are thinking about?", "David Dvorak", "I would say it's in the ballpark, yes.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS.", "Okay. And then just a follow-up with regards to the consultant fees, when we spoke to the consultants as you I think alluded to on your call today. Some of the payments have kind of been held up due to monitoring review. Would it be safe to say that the accrued expenses for US consultant fees one way another were around $120 million, $130 million for the year in the US?", "David Dvorak", "I will tell you what you can do, is you saw the posting, the website posting that was made, the initial posting that put our total payments at round $85 million. And then as I indicated on the call, we had fourth quarter payments of $23 million that have been delayed. That math doesn\u2019t quite get to your number Bruce.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS.", "Okay. So the full year was closer to overall 110 or so.", "David Dvorak", "And again we are talking specifically about US Hip to Knee.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS.", "Correct. ", "David Dvorak", "Payments, right.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS.", "Alright. Thanks so much.", "David Dvorak", "Sure. Thanks Bruce.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from Jeff Johnson of Robert W. Baird.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "Good morning guys. All my questions have really been asked. At this point the only follow-up I guess I would have is just at the upcoming AAOS meeting anything we should be looking for there. It appears you guys might not be having an analyst meeting at this point. Is that correct and maybe what was the rational in holding one this year?", "David Dvorak", "Yeah that is correct. We are excited about the AAOS and would love to have you come through the booth and we can show you some exciting things. As far as the analyst meeting goes, just because of scheduling we thought that the best thing to do was to maintain our circuit on this conference and to make ourselves available to all of you as best we can in both in person and by phone. So we didn't see the necessity of having that meeting.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "Fair enough, David. I guess one more question on that to any change in tone of the AAOS meeting or do you plan on changing anything at all. How you reach out to surgeons there, dialing things back maybe a little from where they have been in the past or pretty much status quo go forward?", "David Dvorak", "Well we are excited about what we how to demonstrate in the way of the efficacy of our products. Obviously, our ongoing service efforts are compelling to these surgeons and making their decisions and the other healthcare professionals.", "I think that everything you are going to see that the booth is going being indicative of the tone that we are establishing and continuing to collaborate with the surgeons, but making sure that our practices are perfectly compliant, so standby.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W.

I would like to welcome you to the Zimmer First Quarter 2008 Earnings Call. Joining me today to host this call are David Dvorak, President and Chief Executive Officer and Jim Crines, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. This morning we'll review our performance for the first quarter, present an update to our outlook for 2008, provide you with report on some key initiatives, and conclude our discussion with a question-and-answer session.

", "A rebroadcast of this call will be available from approximately two hours following the conclusion of today\u2019s call through the end of the day on May 4, 2008, and can also be accessed from the Investor Relations section of the Zimmer website. ", "At this time, I would like to introduce David Dvorak, President and Chief Executive Officer of Zimmer.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you Paul, and good morning everyone. Today I would like to review the overall results for the quarter and address the progress we are making in furtherance of the strategic priorities we previously outlined. First, let\u2019s review our first quarter results.", "Consolidated sales for the quarter of $1.059 billion, were up 11.5% over the prior year first quarter, 6.2% in constant currency, and we delivered 6.1% growth in adjusted earnings per share. We are pleased with our earnings performance and cash flow generation in the first quarter. Our sales results, when adjusted for a reduction in billing days in United States, and the negative impact of the previously announced actions at our Ohio-based orthopedic surgical products operation, reflect performance in line with our expectations. The continued weakening of the US dollar has favorably impacted our top line growth, and as we\u2019ve pointed in the past, our hedging program essentially neutralizes the impact to our bottom line.", "During the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $243 million and we used $144 million to repurchase 1.88 million shares. Jim, will discuss these results and changes to our stock repurchase program in greater detail later in the call.", "The market opportunity for our products continues to be strong across all three of our major geographic segments, and we continue to believe the market for our core reconstructive products is growing at mid single-digits on a per share basis with mixed benefit opportunities adding to 1% to 3% for new devices that address unmet clinical needs. Our first quarter sales performance was well balanced and consistent with this view of the global orthopaedic market. I will now turn to our updated guidance for the full year 2008.", "We previously explained that we developed our guidance taking into account our assessment of the market and the ongoing opportunities and risks that could cause and impact our performance. Our outlook called for top-line growth for the year of 10% to 11% net sales on a reported basis. As we indicated in our fourth quarter call, sales will be driven by new product introductions and further market penetration by key products launched in 2007 and this year, as well as the positive effect of a weaker broad.", "Our guidance for top-line growth remains in the 10% to 11% range on a reported basis. The previously announced impact on OSP revenues is expected to be offset by the positive effect of a weaker dollar. In addition, as the year began, we projected earnings per share of between $4.20 and $4.25, based on those expectations. We've maintained that guidance today, after taking into account the negative financial impact we'll experience as a result of loss sales, inventory losses and remediation costs in our OSP business. We have also now factored in the anticipated positive financial impact of a number of other planned actions that Jim will describe in more detail, which are expected to offset the negative impact of the OSP situation.", "On our fourth quarter earnings calls, Jim and I previewed a number of significant infrastructure initiatives that will position us to respond to the growing medical needs of an aging population. Cheap among these are the investments we're making to ensure that we maintain state-of-the-art quality systems and processes in all of our business operations globally.", "Our ongoing commitment to quality will be unyielding, as we continuously improve our quality systems. To that end, our infrastructure investment plans for 2008 are, in part, directed at opportunities to enhance quality systems across our entire manufacturing network, and to ensure the quality systems and practices in all divisions meet or exceed our standards, as well as those of agencies that regulate us.", "As a result of this endeavor, in the first quarter we initiated a comprehensive remediation effort at our OSP division Dover, Ohio including voluntary product recalls of certain OSP products, voluntary and temporary suspension of manufacturing and sales of certain products, facilities equipment and procedural upgrades, enhance quality training for OSP employees and appointment of a new divisional president.", "While we're clearly disappointed by the OSP situation, we believe the actions we've taken demonstrate the seriousness with which we take quality systems' matters and we're keeping the FDA informed of all of our actions.", "Now, I'd like to focus on and provide details regarding the progress that we've made early in 2008 and the other key priorities that were highlighted on our fourth quarter call. One of our priorities is to meet or exceed our stated goals for financial performance. Our updated guidance demonstrates that we'll take necessary steps wherever possible and within the interest of our stockholders to offset the negative impacts of unplanned events to the best of our ability.", "Another key priority for Zimmer is to make investments in manufacturing facilities operations, and very importantly, our employees, so that we're prepared to serve the healthcare market of the future, generating positive returns for years to come.", "During the quarter, we took a significant step in assuring that our global manufacturing network is ready to meet growing demand. We announced and began to work on a new Zimmer facility in Shannon, Ireland and are making additional investments across our global manufacturing network. The Shannon project also reflects our intention to geographically diversify our manufacturing base. These investments, combined with our other operating infrastructure initiatives, comprised an ambitious program to build our business globally.", "Over the last seven months since entering into our resolution agreements with the US government, we've considered carefully what it will take to shape the future growth of our industry. As we shared during our fourth quarter earnings call, this process has let us to move beyond the requirements of our resolution agreements to create what we believe is a more sustainable model for growth, based on practices that reduce potential or even perceived conflicts of interest involving physician collaborators.", "Our most urgent priority is to continue to develop products that are best-in-class in terms of the benefit they deliver to patients, the difficult problems that they solved across the clinical continuum and their quality. We need to fulfill this mission in ways that broadly inspire confidence and trust. That's why we have chosen not to incrementalize these efforts. We want to go through this transition once in a comprehensive manner across our global enterprise.", "Last week, we publicly communicated the strategies we've established at this stage which create fundamental changes in product development, surgeon training, educational and charitable funding and transparency. Taken together, they create a new model to aggressively reduce potential or perceived conflicts of interest, while preserving the best of the collaboration that drives innovation in our industry.", "Finally, before I turn the call over to Jim, I want to note that in March, we were informed by the US Department of Justice, Antitrust Division that they have closed their investigation that was first announced in June 2006. We are very pleased that the DOJ's antitrust investigation is closed, and that neither the company, nor any of our employees were charged in connection with the investigation.", "Jim will now provide further details on the quarter and our 2008 guidance. Jim?", "Jim Crines", "Thanks, David. I will review our performance in the quarter in more detail and then provide some additional information related to our guidance.", "Sales of $1.59 billion for the quarter represent an increase of 11.5% reported, and 6.2% in constant currency. These results reflect an estimated loss of $6.5 million in OSP product sales as well as the effect of one less billing day in the US On a day rate basis, and excluding the impact of the OSP matter, these results are in line with our expectations for the quarter. ", "A weaker US dollars compared with prior year, added 5.3% or $50 million of revenue in the quarter. As expected consolidated price was flat for the quarter, and the Americas pricing contributed six-tenths of a point of growth in the quarter, in Europe, price was half a point negative. Germany, Italy, Sweden, France and UK reported low single digit reductions in average selling prices while other markets in Europe were flat to slightly positive. Asia Pacific results include negative price of 0.9%, driven by negative 2.8% in Japan offset by flat deposited prices in other Asia Pacific markets.", "Turning to our revenue growth by major product category, worldwide reconstructed sales increased to 11.8% reported, 6.3% constant currency with the billing day difference in the US accounting for nearly a point reduction in growth. Knee sales improved 6.7%, reflecting lower mix benefit associated with the NextGen Gender Solutions Knee compared to prior year first quarter. Knee pricing on a global basis was flat for the quarter. Flex knees accounted for 49% of our knee units on a global basis, slightly ahead of our last two quarters.", "We are still early into the launch of our Gender Solutions Natural-Knee Flex as well as our NextGen mobile bearing knee. Unit sales of these two systems accounted for less than 10% of our knee units on a global basis in the quarter and represent an important opportunity going forward. In addition, our new gender solutions Patello-femoral Joint System is now broadly available and we're also launching a Trabecular Metal Tibial Tray for our NextGen Knee System.", "In other knee systems, Zimmer Uni LCCK and RHK as well as our Prolong Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene grew in double digit. Geographically in the first quarter, our knee sales in constant currency increased 6.1% in the Americas, 5.9% in Europe and a particularly strong 12.3% in Asia-Pacific. We feel very good about our Knee product line, as we look out through the rest of the year at the opportunities we have with recent Knee product launches.", "Hip sales increased 3.5% in the quarter reflecting a volume and mix increase of 4% offset by a decrease in average selling prices of 0.5%. These results no longer include bone cement sales, which for reporting purpose have been reclassified as OSP and other product sales. The purpose of this change is to provide you with greater transparency to underlying performance of our hip portfolio. These results reflect steady growth across our primary hip portfolio including porous primary stems and Acetabular cups. Our TM primary and M/L Taper with connective technology experience steady growth offsetting part by lower sales by VerSys Fiber Metal MidCoat, Beaded 6\" FullCoat, and other cemented stems.", "TM Modular Cups and Durom and Acetabular component sales reported solid growth, as did Metasul large-diameter heads, with the Metasul brand realizing over 26% reported growth in sales in the quarter on a relatively small base.", "On a geographic basis, and in constant currency, hip sales increased 3.3% in the Americas, 2.9% in Europe, and 6% in Asia Pacific, inclusive of negative price of 2.3%. Extremity sales for the quarter on constant currency increased 27.3%, on a challenging comp of 29.6% in the first quarter of 2007. Extremity sales increased 30.9% in the Americas, 19.3% in Europe, and 11.5% in Asia Pacific.", "Dental sales increased 9.1% for the quarter on a prior year comp of 20.6%. Dental sales increased 5.1% in the Americas, and 26.6% in Europe, including the effect of the distributor acquisition in Italy, which closed in the second quarter of 2007. Dental sales decreased 7.3% in Asia Pacific on a base of less than 10 million, and against a very challenging comp of 46% growth in the prior year first quarter. ", "Trauma sales in the quarter were up over the prior year period 5.6% in constant currency. This growth is in line with our expectations as we bring greater focus to the sales efforts supporting our trauma product line and continue to face competitive pressures on our Intramedullary Nails and compression hip screws. Trauma sales in the quarter increased 5% in the Americas, 8.4% in Asia Pacific and 4.7% in Europe. A 13.8% of a prior year first quarter spine sales are at pace with market growth led by the sales of Thoracolumbar Outerbody fusion products, Interbody Spacers, and Dynesys. ", "Spine, in the Americas, was up 11.1%, Europe increased 27.7%, and Asia Pacific was up 20% on a small base. Finally, Orthopaedic Surgical products and other sales grew 0.8% constant currency in the quarter, patients care product sale s declines 15.6% as a results of the OSP actions while Bone cement and accessory sales now reported in this category increased 23.4% over the first quarter of 2007. The OSP and other category was up 3.2% in the Americas, 0.5% in Asia Pacific and decline 9.1% in Europe, compared with prior year period. ", "Now, I'll focus on the rest of the income statement. Our adjusted gross profit margin of 76% for the quarter reflects a reduction of approximately 50 basis point for inventory related charges associated with OSP. R&D expense decreased 4.5% to $50 million for the quarter, reflecting lower spending on consulting services. Certain US knee and hip development clinical and external research activities have been delayed, as we work our way through operational compliance with the resolution agreements, and our recently announced enhanced compliance and ethics initiatives. We expect activities to resume in the second quarter. ", "Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $415.6 million, up 14.9% to prior year and include monitor fees and expenses and higher instrument cost in the quarter. SG&A expenses were favorably impacted by a change in estimate related to share-based compensation expense that resulted in a reduction of approximately 50 basis points in SG&A for the quarter.", "Acquisition, Integration, and Other amounted to $7.3 million in the quarter, comprised principally of costs pertaining to 2007 acquisitions. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased 2.8% to $339.2 million, and at 32% our adjusted operating profit to sales ratio decreased by 270 basis points from prior year, as a result of a lower gross margin and planned increases in SG&A cost.", "Interest income for the quarter amounted to $1 million, adjusted net earnings increased 3.7% to $244.3 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 6.1%, to $1.04, on 233.9 million average outstanding diluted shares. These adjusted earnings per share are inclusive of approximately $0.05 of share-based compensation and at a $1.02, reported diluted earnings per share increased 4.1% on prior year first quarter reported EPS of $0.98. At 28.1% adjusted for the quarter, our effective tax rate is consistent with our expectations and below prior year due to resolution of certain tax positions.", "During the quarter, we repurchased 1,883,000 shares at a total purchase price of $144.3 million or an average price per share of $76.61. As of March 31, 2008, we have remaining capacity to acquire up to 477 million of stock under the repurchase program authorized in December 2006.", "As indicated in our release, our Board has authorized an additional 1.25 billion stock repurchase program which expires on December 31, 2009. I will further discuss this in my comments on guidance. For us, in the absence a significant demands on our cash, stock repurchases remain an effective and efficient use of available free cash flow. Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $242.7 million, an increase of 26% over prior year first quarter, as a result of strong performance on working capital management and suspended royalty payments of $22 million. ", "Inventory days on hand finished the quarter at 268 days, a decrease of 19 days from prior year first quarter, reflecting higher cost of goods in the quarter. Our trade accounts receivable day sales outstanding finished the quarter at 59 days, consistent with prior year first quarter.", "Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter increased to $61.8 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $110.9 million, including $57.5 million for instruments and $53.5 million for property, plant and equipment with $24 million related to infrastructure initiatives. Finally, free cash flow was $131.8 million for the quarter.", "Now, I would like to provide an update on guidance for 2008. As reported in our press release on April 3, OSP-related actions are expected to adversely impact 2008, OSP revenues by $70 million to $80 million. These actions are expected to negatively impact 2008 adjusted earnings per share by $0.18 to $0.20, including $0.07 related to inventory charges, idle plant cost and other non-recurring expenses. Approximately, $0.03 for the full year effect is reflected in our first quarter results.", "We expect this impact to be offset by reductions in planned operating expenses, share repurchases, and other actions. With regard share repurchases, as already mentioned, our Board has authorized an additional $1.25 billion of repurchases, which can be financed in whole or in part with third party debt. We intend to draw out the 500 million in our credit facility and use the funds to repurchase shares. This together with repurchases and other ongoing program is expected to reduce estimated diluted weighted average shares for 2008 to 230 million from 234 million, and add interest expense of approximately $10 million before tax.", "Share repurchases or reductions in planned operating expenses are expected to offset the negative operating margin impact from OSP. Other actions which are likely to incorporate one-time gains are expected to offset the non-recurring OSP charges. Regarding an update then on full year guidance, we expect to deliver top line sales growth in 2008 at the original 10% to 11% range, and adjusted earnings per share in the same range of $4.20 to $4.25, including the items noted.", "As always our guidance and assumptions exclude the affect of potential future acquisitions or other unforeseen material business event. Taking a closure look at sales expectations and the effect of a weaker US dollar, we now anticipate four points of growth to come from foreign currency. Therefore, with the OSP impact, our sales guidance now assumes a constant currency growth rate of 6% to 7% for the year. ", "We anticipate a tax rate of around 28.5% four-tenths above our first quarter rate for 2008, which includes the favorable resolution of certain tax positions. To arrive at our GAAP earnings per share, you should assume subtracting acquisition integration and other cost of approximately $27 million or an estimated $0.8 per share.", "Turing to cash flow, we anticipate capital expenditures in the range of $400 million to $500 million, reflecting the capital components of many of our 2008 infrastructure and operating initiatives.", "David, I'll turn the call back over to you.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you, Jim. We're excited about the opportunities that are ahead for Zimmer. We believe that our products are the best on the market and we respect and appreciate the responsibilities that come with being a market leader. The strategic initiatives we've discussed today will make Zimmer even stronger in the long run and better able to meet the demands of the future. In the immediate term, we will continue to execute against our three major priorities. First, meet or exceed our stated goals for financial performance. Second, implement the infrastructure and operational initiatives that will prepare Zimmer to participate in the future growth of the market in a significant way. And third, develop the market exceptional products under compliance standards for collaboration that consistently earn the trust of our stakeholders.", "And now, I'd like to open the call to your questions.", "", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you very much. (Operator Instructions). Our first question today comes for Bob Hopkins with Lehman Brothers.", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Hi, thank you and good morning.", "David Dvorak", "Good morning, Bob.", "Jim Crines", "Good morning, Bob.", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Couple of questions. First, of the two point decrease in constant currency growth guidance that you're giving, is that entirely OSP-related? Or is there also reduction in your outlook for hip and knee constant currency growth for the course of the year?", "David Dvorak", "That is the direct effect of the OSP impact.", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "So there is no change in your constant currency growth assumptions for the full year for hips and knees versus the guidance that you gave on your Q4 call?", "David Dvorak", "No, that's correct. We are seeing the same market that we saw when we put our plan together for 2008, where we believe again the procedure rate is mid-single digits and then there is still an opportunity for one to three points on mix.", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "But, if you look at your first quarter constant currency hip and knee results, especially in hips, it's still off about 3 to 4 points sequentially from the Q4 kinds of levels. Could you talk to why we saw that sort of decrease in the first quarter and what sort of headwinds you faced in the first quarter?", "David Dvorak", "Well, I think that the procedure growth that we reported out on the fourth quarter of last year was stronger than what was averaged in 2007 and our 2008 full year guidance assumes again a mid-single digit procedure rate with that mix opportunity. So, that was a fall off from procedure growth, but some of that could be reflected by virtue of the fact that we had an impact on billing days as well as the timing of Easter and some of the other companies reported on that.", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "What kind of impact do you think, like was the selling days one day and what kind of impact do you think you saw from Easter?", "David Dvorak", "If we put all of that together, Bob, the Easter holiday, the timing of the academy as well as the billing day, it's probably a point in our estimate.", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Couple of other things, quickly. Do you expect the OSP products to be back on the market by year-end 2008?", "David Dvorak", "Our plan would contemplate that those products would come back on market.", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And then, one other question I have. I am just curious about the timing of things. Obviously on the fourth quarter call, you guys gave very bullish report and very bullish tone. And yet, when we look back at the timing of the FDA recall announcement as it relates to OSP, that was sort of in full swing, as you are giving that guidance. But it wasn't disclosed. And now we are hearing that it's a $0.18 to $0.20 headwind for the full year. I am just wondering why didn't you disclose it on the first, on that call, on the fourth quarter, especially now knowing that it's going to be such a major headwind for the full year?", "David Dvorak", "Yes. We had identified a particular recall problem and acted upon that promptly and obviously, the problem was much deeper than what we knew at the time of the call. So, work was underway, but the scope of that issue had not been defined as of the first quarter call. So, we reported out on the magnitude of that issue as soon as that was defined, Bob.", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And then finally for me, do you think any of the deceleration in growth in constant currency in the first quarter that you saw was related to any fallout from the changes you are making inside Zimmer as a result of the settlement with the DOJ. In other words, do you think you lost any share or lost any physicians or sales people or any turnover and distributors that might have impacted results in the first quarter?", "David Dvorak", "Nothing of any significance I will tell you. I think that there is going to be impact over time and there may have been some in the first quarter, because different people are going to come out with these changes with different speed. But we really believe that we're making the right decision for the long-term and our guidance would reflect any impact that we would foresee in that regard.", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Thank you. I will get back in queue.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Thank you very much. When I take a look at absorbing 18% to 20%, that's a huge number, I understand the components of it. But when you think about that amount of money, is it $0.05 a share repurchase, $0.05 from cost cutting. Is there anyway to sort of figure out the magnitude of what you need to do to absorb that?", "Jim Crines", "Well, hi Joanne, this is Jim. As we pointed out the combination of plant reductions and operating costs as well as what we've went through specifically on the call with the share repurchase program going to $500 million on the credit facility and using those funds to repurchase shares. It's a combination of those two things that sort of covers off the loss margin on that $70 million to $80 million of OSP sales impact, and other actions that we have contemplated that would offset the normally current charges with the normally current charges related to your inventory life losses and idle plant expenses and extraordinary outside service fees that we're incurring as we operate, manage our way through that issue.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Market", "Is there any thing that you are cutting out that you wouldn't have otherwise? I mean if this hadn\u2019t come along would we be looking at a 27 B in 2008?", "Jim Crines", "Well some of what you are seeing, and you see it in our first quarter results as we get further down the road on our enhance compliance and ethics initiatives there is clearly some lower spending. You saw that in the quarter in R&D. So, some how what we have reflected in the reductions and plant operating expenses are consistent with what you're seeing in the first quarter and otherwise in some respects it\u2019s timing. We came into the year planning to increase our spend in total at around $100 million and it does take time to have ramp up that kind of increase in operating expenses. We don't, at this point see it having any effect on the ability to execute on those strategic infrastructure and operating initiatives, but there is a bit of timing issue in terms of the ramp up of those expenses.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Market", "Okay. How much did the moving of the bone cement out of hips impact the hip growth number this quarter?", "Jim Crines", "It's by about a points and which is consistent as well with what we would have reported last year.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Market", "Did you see any pickup in hips because of the striker product recall?", "Jim Crines", "Not in our numbers, no.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Market", "Okay, thank you very much. ", "Jim Crines", "Welcome.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Mark Mullikin with Piper Jaffray.", "John Crawler \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Hi, actually this is John Crawler [ph] covering for Mark. Just a couple of quick questions here, I\u2019m sorry if this is already been covered, but did you see any competitive impact of the DOJ settlement in this last quarter, either gaining share or affecting your over all growth in the quarter?", "David Dvorak", "I don't think that there is anything that's discernable in that regard. I think that the structure of that resolution is to ensure that there is a level plain field, and I think they are generally speaking effective in achieving that objective. ", "John Crawler \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay, great and then just a quick question on, are you guys seeing any increases in the cost to your components that maybe affecting your bottom-line at this point?", "David Dvorak", "No, John, we have some visibility coming into the year to the increase you maybe referring to in cobalt chrome prices. Yeah, we use cobalt chrome in many of our devices, but again we have good visibility to that coming into the year and that was reflected in the guidance that we provided on the margin. ", "John Crawler \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Great, alright and then one just last quick question on the cash you currently have on the balance sheet, is any of that in like auction rate securities, something that maybe you wouldn't have access to at this point in time?", "David Dvorak", "No, John, going back to sort of, the middle of last year.  We didn't have anything in auction rate securities per say, but we took action to even move money out of money market funds that might have had some exposure to those securities, and our $475 million is invested in short-term treasury back securities. So, we have no exposure to what's happening, or what has happened with those auction rate securities markets.", "John Crawler  \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Great. All right. Well, thank you very much.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Okay. Your next question from Tao Levy with Deutsche Bank.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank", "Hi Good morning. I was wondering if you could actually give us a dollar amount for the bone cement in the hip business.", "Jim Crines", "We have not, Tao, provided that kind of detail and as I said, it declined about a point of growth in the quarter.  That\u2019s consistent with what it was contributing as you go back to last year and as we make this change. Obviously we will go forward with the filing of our quarterly filing that will be reflected in the prior year numbers as well. You will able to the math then when you see the quarterly filings.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay. And also just a follow up on Bob\u2019s question, he asked whether OSP would come out, come back online in 2008 and I think you just said, it would come back online and I don\u2019t know if meant in \u201908 or \u201909?", "Jim Crines", "Yeah. Our plan is obviously, as soon as we can be comfortable that we are operating with our quality standards in mind to bring those products back online. Some of the products are still online at this point in time and we are very comfortable with those obviously. If all goes well, we would expect before the year is out to bring the other products back online, but we couldn\u2019t give you any absolute assurance of that.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay. And then just lastly, I just wanted to get a sense, obviously we have seen other companies report and you mentioned that the Easter affects your billing days. What\u2019s your sense as you exhibit the quarter as you feel a little bit of April, you look back at to that as a business returned more to a click that you would have, that you are seeing, sort of at the beginning of, sort of in the January, February timeframe. I was trying to make sure that maybe are we going to see bit of a bolus activity here in the second quarter because of those issues?", "David Dvorak", "We obviously reported on the first quarter, and we don\u2019t have visibility as to what we overall markets and the other companies are going to be reporting for the month of April at this stage.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities", "But I was just trying to figure out, how do we get comfortable that we are talking about Easter billing day, if your billing days is in fact what's going on and it's not a major market slowdown that\u2019s not reflected in billing days, etceteras.", "David Dvorak", "Well, as we said with perspective of the first quarter, we still believe that it\u2019s a mid single-digit procedure growth rate with an opportunity for 1% to 3% mix, and that's the premise to our 2008 plan and continues to be our insight as to what the market's doing through the first quarter.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay. And then just lastly, the activity that\u2019s going on in Ireland and new manufacturing facilities, what\u2019s going to come out of there and when we do we start to see that, I assume it effect your I assume gross margins. When do we start to see that impact the business?", "Jim Crines", "Sure, what we're going to focus on initially in that facility is femoral component need, femoral components. Those are high margin devices; this is in a low tax jurisdiction so make sense for us to have those kinds of components. We also have a process; we have in place to pickup this modular cell manufacturing process, and get them setup fairly quickly in Ireland. We have an aggressive time table that has us producing products in the beginning of next year, and selling that product into the European market initially in I would say the second half of 2009 before it really begins to have to have impact on either gross margin or net margins.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "Thank you. Good morning and thanks for the questions. Let me just follow-up with a couple of the questions we've had so far just to clarify Dave what your views are on the business. Last year you grew your recon business about 9% constant currency, it was I think closer to 10% in the fourth quarter, and then here you reported 6% growth in recon, which obviously excludes the impact of what's going on in Dover. And you said maybe a point of that was attributable to that being from a comp standpoint fewer selling days and Easter being in March this year instead of April. What do you think the other 3% is versus fourth quarter or maybe 2% than versus '07?", "David Dvorak", "Primarily I think that versus fourth quarter the difference is the procedure rate, and we saw an uptick I think that all other companies reported favorable results in the fourth quarter. To reconcile this back to last year, you're getting into some timing issues with respect to new product launches. For instance, Mike, we are anniversary out of a mix benefit on the gender line for Next-Gen, but we're also picking up opportunities. ", "In the second half of the year, we're going to be able to fully exploit the opportunity that we have with the mobile bearing knee. We also are very optimistic about what we might be able to generate in the way of opportunities with respect to the Natural-Knee with the Gender Flex attributes included, and then the M/L Taper with connective technology is a product that we're optimistic about. ", "So, I think that it's product cycle oriented, but we feel like we're in good shape to produce good results on knees, and we also feel like as the year progresses and we are in the next year, we ought to be able to improve on our hip performance.", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "You're guiding now to 6% to 7% total company constant currency growth but the OSP impact is about 200 basis points. So I assume you're thinking that recon is going to be more like 8% to 9% this year versus for the year versus the 6% we saw in the first quarter.", "Jim Crines", "It's certainly fair to assume Mike. This is Jim. That it's going to be higher than to 6% to 7% that we guided to for the overall results. ", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "If you're of the assumption that that growth accelerates over the balance of the year, you think its steps up in the second quarter.  Is there something that drives in actual acceleration? ", "Jim Crines", "Well, that's really as David pointed out that's products cycle related, and as we get deeper into the launch of these new products, the mobile bearing, the natural flex, the connective, the Gender hip offering with connective technology. ", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "I mean you clarified a couple of other items Jim. You made a comment where you said that you change the accounting for stock-based comp expense and that reduced the SG&A by 50 basis points for the quarter. Did I hear that right?  Maybe you could just explain it?", "Jim Crines", "Sure, we didn't change the accounting; we recorded a change in estimate. We've recorded a change in estimates, recognized the difference in actual versus assumed forfeiture rates that were being used to accrue for a share compensation expense and that adjustment was made in the quarter, and it had that impact on SG&A expense.", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "So for the year, will it produce by 50 basis points or is it one-time?", "Jim Crines", "No, its more of a one-time, they don't reduce it modestly going forward but the effect you saw in the quarter was more of a one-time adjustment to just get caught up for those differences.", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "And then, as you talked about the $0.18 to $0.20 impact from OSP and the $0.07 that you are calling non-recurring, you're saying you're going to offset that through some other actions, some other one-time gains. Can you give us any visibility on what those one-time gains might be that would offset that?", "Jim Crines", "Well, I won't give you any specifics, but I will tell you coming into the year that we were looking at some opportunities that we are really focused on improving returns on invested capital, the more balance sheet focused initiatives. That included financing share repurchases with that. We've obviously taken action on that. And some of the other things that are included, for example, are monetizing non-strategic assets and that's what results in one-time gain. And again, I don't want to get into any specifics, but I will say that there is a high probability of those transactions occurring between now and the end of the year.", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "Okay. But basically, the way you wanted to do it, you wanted to take out that $0.07 and based on what you are saying is true, cost cutting, share repurchase, you are going to offset $0.11 to $0.13 which you would call recurring or operating, incremental operating or loss operating income because of OSP?", "Jim Crines", "That's a right way to think about it.", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then the last question is to clarify. Dave, the answer to Bob's question about the timing of the April 3 announcement on OSP, because the recalls, we have this from the FDA database occurred in December and then I think on January 30. So what was it that took place that made you say, hey, we have got to come out and make this announcement now on April 3. Was it that you closed the quarter and you said there was a real impact there and we've got to make sure the Street knows about it?", "David Dvorak", "Let me walk through with a little more detail, Mike, of the events that occurred. And as you said, we had a recall in December, there were other recalls subsequent to that event and as we were re-scoping those issues we got deeper and deeper and became more and more concerned with some of the fundamental quality systems there ultimately leading the decision that we announced earlier this month. Included in that time period was, as you know, any time you make a recall, there is likely to be an FDA inspection. There was an inspection. There were some observations. We had a third-party come in and essentially do a wall-to-wall review and as a consequence of that very in-depth review we identified some specific actions that we want to take. So, that\u2019s a lot of work over the course of many weeks, subsequent to that first quarter call leading up to that announcement.", "The actions that we were taking both at the end of March and into the beginning of April, included notifying customers, explaining to employees what we're doing to ensure that the quality systems were at the level that was consistent with our standards. And so, we didn't want to have any type of disclosure issue there as we were taken the right steps to protect the patients' interest at all times. We didn't want to have some miss construction of that information in the financial markets and we thought that the best way to solve that problem was to put the release out that we put out earlier in the month.", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "Thanks for the explanation.", "David Dvorak", "Sure.", "Operator", "We will take our next question Michael Matson with Wachovia Capital.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess with regards to the slowdown that we seen in procedures, I was just wondering, are you guys hearing anything at all about the possibility that the economy is affecting procedure volumes. Obviously, consumers are under some extreme stress here and I have the sense that copays may have increased over the past five to ten years. Is there any increased economic sensitivity out there?", "David Dvorak", "I don't detect that there is. I think that there was some speculations at the end of last year that supported the bolus that we saw on procedure growth in the fourth quarter that some people may have been concerned about potentially an economic downturn that accelerated there, locking into date for these elective procedures. But in the core recon market, I don't think that we're seeing any fundamental impact I suppose if there was a long-term and a sustained economic downturn that could have an impact, but we're not seeing any of those signs in the core business. The segment although we still like the market a great deal that we have probably seen some consequences to an economic downturn that is the dental market because that's much more private pay oriented.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital", "Okay. And then with regards to the compliance changes that you announced and I guess there is the possibility that you buy out some of the royalties. And I was just wondering what the timing of that would be and whether or not that would have any kind of impact on your P&L?", "Jim Crines", "Yes, Mike, this is Jim. We anticipate those buyouts to occur on a rolling basis over a period of several quarters. We do expect at this point at least that we will fund those buyouts out of the free cash flow on a quarterly basis. We are at this point a bit uncertain as to the exact outcome and timing, and we can't provide any more specific items than that. We will of course provide updated disclosure on any material developments and our periodic filings as appropriate. But that says, we're going to work, we're interested in moving forward expeditiously, and again that as much as I can provide in terms of detail at this point.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital", "Okay. And then, can we interpret this large repurchase authorization and the fact that you're planning to take on by about $500 million in debt to finance some of that. As a sign the acquisitions or particularly sizable acquisitions may be less likely over the next 12 months or so?", "Jim Crines", "I don't think you should construe the share repurchase move as an indication of any of our intent or opportunity with respect to merger and acquisition activity. Rather you really always just look at that as our capability on the balance sheet. ", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital", "Okay, and then on gross margin, can you quantify how much of an impact the hedging had for foreign currency?", "Jim Crines", "Well, what I will say Mike, is I would really go back to the guidance that we provided on the fourth quarter call coming into the year that this, we'd indicated there that the guidance of 76% to 77% gross margin for 2008 that the difference between '08 and '07 was principally due to this hedge losses that we're going to be running through our results for 2008. And, that gives you some sense, and I guess the other thing that we pointed out if look at the contribution that we're getting on our top-line from currency, we said that typically gets neutralized thorough our hedging program on the operating profit line. So you can apply our operating profit ratio as a benchmark to that pickup that we're getting on the top line. You get a sense of what's running through cost-to-goods on hedge losses. ", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital", "Alright, that's all I've got. Thanks a lot.", "Jim Crines", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Matt Miksic with Morgan Stanley.", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "Hey, good morning, thanks for taking the questions. I think a lot of the stuff here has been toured pretty well, but I got a couple of follow-ups on the trends in the quarter. I guess it sounds like it\u2019s sort of summing it up, you had some year-over-year comparison that impacted your numbers and is 1% Easter selling days and did I hear that right that it was also about 1% OSP, or is that that all together?", "Jim Crines", "Well, the OSP number that we quoted was about was $6.5 million net for the quarter.", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "Okay.", "Jim Crines", "A little less than 1%.", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And, I wanted to get a sense as we go into Q2. Are there any similar year-over-year comps, either positive or negative that we should be aware of as we think about modeling the second quarter?", "Jim Crines", "No. I would tell you there isn\u2019t anything of the nature that we saw in the first quarter.", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "So, no getting back on selling day? No getting back Easter? ", "Jim Crines", "That there is, as we look, I guess about at the balance of the year, we do expect to pick up that billing day that we lost in the first quarter, and as I don\u2019t have it here in front of me and I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s in the second quarter, but we do pick that up in the balance of the year.", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Question on the quality system remediation that you are working on for OSP, if you could give us some sense of maybe what that is running or what that runs in terms of operating expenses, and whether that\u2019s included in the $0.18 to $0.20 impact that you talked about in the press release?", "Jim Crines", "It is reflected in the $0.18 to $0.20 impact.", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. But, you don\u2019t want to give us any sense of what that is, just because that will be something, I guess the question also is, does that roll off towards the end of the year?", "Jim Crines", "Sure. What we did, we pointed out, I guess in the $0.18 to $0.20 we have included $0.07 for what we thought for inventory charges, idle plant cost, and other non-recurring cost that the other non-recurring is include significant outside service fees that we're incurring. Thus we work our way through the issues at OSP and we would expect those service fees to take or off as we get towards the end of the year.", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. I want to, couple of questions on sort of the monitoring and compliance, the DOJ related issues. Can you give us some sense?  You've talked about what the quarterly expense rate was in helping us put together our '08 numbers related to the federal monitoring expenses. Any sense of how you are tracking against that range, which I guess was in $8 million to $10 million range?", "Jim Crines", "Yes, as we weigh it, guided to $0.02 to $0.03 per quarter and indicated that we in our guidance, were anticipating being at the high end of that range. The monitor fees for the first quarter were within that range. We expect they will continue to be within that range. We have and continue to reflect in our estimates for the year, an expectation that between monitor fees and other outside service fees on compliance, we would be at the high end of that range.", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And, then you also talked a little bit about these contracts holding up some the R&D spending, external consulting spend, and you are expecting that to resume in Q2. If I understand that correctly, I am assuming that means that you will have your contract sort of restructured and approved to begin those that work in Q2, is that right?", "Jim Crines", "Yes, generally that\u2019s right. Matt, I think that, one thing that you ought to know is that our annual needs assessment is approved, so that we have the ability to conduct meetings, those meetings are getting scheduled, surgeon contracts or being sent out now to engage those surgeons for services that are contemplated by that annual needs assessment. So those activities both on the training and education side as well as we hope on the development side will begin again here in this quarter. I would expect that you are going to see a gradual ramp up in the second quarter, and then by the time we get into the third quarter we should be at a full cliff.", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And any sense you can give us as to how that might show up in your P&L, if there is any charges or changes on accruals throughout the rest of the year that we should think about. I think you are not guiding to it now, but just to give us idea.", "Jim Crines", "Well I guess what I will say is this Jim. As we've pointed out in the past, we continue to accrue, for example, under our legacy royalty arrangements, our royalty expenses under the terms of those legacy arrangements. And that's what we have at this point, that's what we have reflected in our guidance and our assumptions going forward for the balance of 2008. As we pointed out before, as we go through this process of settling out those agreements and there are any material changes to those expectations, we'll have to provide that information at that time. And most of the rest of what you see in the way of the surgeon payments falls in the R&D line within the P&L.", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, that's helpful. Just wanted to talk a little bit about, if you could just give us a quick status as to how things are progressing on some of the major product launches you have in recon like knee, Natural-Knee, gender hip and the mobile bearing knee. And maybe just at a high level, where are you sort of in instruments and training, any of them moving faster or slower, any kind of updates you have as to when during the year, you'd expect to start to pickup some momentum. ", "Jim Crines", "Yeah, I would say, we're sort of where we anticipated we would be, we're still obviously early into the launch as we pointed out. We did not have the opportunity with NBK for example to build out a lot of inventory in advance of getting approval .So there is, that ones maybe relative to where we are for example with the natural knee flex, that ones facing a little bit behind, in terms of getting the inventory and instruments out into the field. And on the hip side, that the M/L Taper with connective technology were in good shape, in terms of where we are relative to where we expected to be getting again the instruments in the inventory deployed out in the field. ", "As far as training goes, obviously there, with not having conducted any surgical skills training in the first quarter, that may have had some modest effect on certainly our ability to bring on any new customers, who are unfamiliar with those systems. That's probably more of an issue with the connective than it is with the knee systems. I think a lot of the customers that we were talking about those new knee systems are either very familiar with using a mobile bearing knee or very familiar with using the posterior referencing system that goes along with the natural knee gender flex product.", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, and then there's one final question, if I could on spine. It looks like this is another sort of mid-teens constant currency growth quarter taking some share, a modest amount of share in that market. Could you highlight what\u2019s going on in spine, what the drivers are, and if there's anything we can expect in the next three or six months to maybe affect the growth of that business?", "David Dvorak", "Yeah this is David, Matt. I think that what you are seeing principally is outer body sales, you know we have fully integrated the Endius acquisition.  We have a good pedicle screw system for both thoracolumbar and the cervical region now, and so we are seeing an up tick in sales there. Obviously that affects the interbody sales as well. So it's basic offerings with respect to fusion procedures, and I think that our differentiating product continues to be Dynesys and we continue to work towards the expanded regulatory clearance for the non-fusion application. But in the meantime, we market the product as an adjunct to fusion and that is a product that we continuously hear good things from clinicians.", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "Any timing or milestones we can look forward on Dynesys data or anything like that?", "David Dvorak", "I don\u2019t have anything specific for you at this point in time.", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Well thanks very much for taking the questions.", "David Dvorak", "Okay. Thanks Matt. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jason Wittes with Leerink Swann.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "Hi. Thanks a lot. I just wanted some clarification on how you are going to make up the $0.18. Specifically it looks like you are holding back on some expenditure notably in R&D and SG&A I assume. Does that mean that in \u201909, some of the investments that you plan on making this year fall into next year? How should we be thinking about that?", "Jim Crines", "Yeah. Not necessarily, Jason. Reductions in planned operating expenses are really probably, I guess focused in a couple of different areas. One, you see the lower spend on consulting services in the first quarter, some of those initiatives is, that\u2019s more of a timing issue.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "Well timing in terms of, it\u2019s still all going to occur this year or some of it will now occur next year?", "Jim Crines", "Some of it will spill over into next year.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "Okay. And, so in terms of R&D spend, it was down this quarter. I guess part of that was due to the monitor. Could you give us an indication on what the right level is for R&D spent for your company?", "Jim Crines", "Well, we came into the year guiding to between 5% and 6% of sales. We would still expect the full year spend to be between within that range. Maybe a bit the lower than I think we had indicated.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "I mean, more towards 5%.", "Jim Crines", "Likely to be in the middle of that range.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "Okay.", "Jim Crines", "Probably a little lower on relative to that guidance.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "And, I guess from a longer-term perspective that\u2019s also about the right range, you think about for R&D spent.", "Jim Crines", "That\u2019s right.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "Okay. Great, thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart with Credit Suisse.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Hi, thanks for taking my call. I just wanted to clarify on that R&D? Did you say it\u2019s going to be low end of the 5% to 6% range or a little bit than the 5%?", "Jim Crines", "No, towards the low end to that range, Kristen.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Okay. What's really change in terms of your expectations in reinvestment here, because in January, I guess you talked a lot about needing to reinvest in the business as in that R&D was something that you needed to increase and that\u2019s one of the reasons why had expected to increase over the level that you saw in 2007. I guess, what's really going on there and any comment on whether or not you are still comfortable with gross margins at 76, 77, and then your SG&A levels at 39 to 40 for the full year?", "Jim Crines", "Sure. Nothing has really changed with respect to our plans to invest in the infrastructure and operating initiatives that we had outlined on the fourth quarter call. I think, if you go back, you would see a lot of that investment was, as we pointed out then, more focused on either manufacturing, selling and distribution infrastructure, IT infrastructure and in places that would show up in SG&A, not necessarily in R&D. And as we just pointed out that given just where we are with the compliance, with resolution agreements, and some of the delays that we experienced in the first quarter, we are now sort of guiding to lower end of that 5% to 6% range on R&D as opposed to being in the middle of that range, which is what we had indicated on the fourth quarter call.", "As per gross margin, we would have the impact as we pointed out that reflected in the first quarter results of inventory charges related to OSP. That had the impact of reducing gross margin in the quarter by about 50 basis points. We do still expect to be for the year within that range that we have guidance to 76% to 77%.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "And SG&A, after the full year?", "Jim Crines", "And SG&A, we have guided to a range of 39% to 40%, still within that range. We had indicated, I guess on the fourth quarter call likely to be in the middle of that range. That maybe more towards the higher side of that range, given some of the fees, the non-recurring fees, we're incurring associated with that OSP issue.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "It sounds like OSP would something that, maybe take you a little bit by surprise. Have you gone through and reviewed the quality systems at your other facilities? Are you comfortable there? Do you have any FDA warning letter that you have received or any 483 observations? I guess what level of comfort do you have that your quality systems elsewhere are what you might expect?", "Jim Crines", "The manufacturing in our other facilities isn't affected by the OSP announcement and the quality of our products from those facilities is in question, never mind. We have a very proactive effort to continuously improve our quality systems, and those over the course of the last year or so have included in depth audits conducted by our third party and it's the firm that we brought in the OSP and are getting their help in scoping out any redesigns that are necessary as part of those remediation efforts. So, our implant facilities, our major facilities have been reviewed by that same firm and we're comfortable with our quality systems at those facilities. ", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Any 483 or warning letter?", "Jim Crines", "We have no pending warning letters and we wouldn't.  The 483\u2019s are going to be part of any inspection that takes place. We wouldn\u2019t be reporting with that level of specificity. But, we would always have (inaudible) entered on our system, where we are correcting and preventing any root cause issues that are identified. So, that's part of an ongoing operation of a quality system.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "And, I think in your kind of earlier comments, you had said that you did expect, although you didn't see it in this quarter, a longer term effect of the change in the consulting agreements, could you just kind of elaborate on this comments just in terms of what you do expect to see?", "Jim Crines", "In what respects, specifically Kristen.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "I think, the question was are you are seeing in terms of the consulting in the DOJ monitoring that had have expected to see a longer term impact over the time? I was just wondering if you could elaborate on your comment?", "Jim Crines", "I\u2019m just not clear as to what contexts that comment was made?", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "You made it earlier I guess, when you were talking about the change in consulting arrangement promoted by the DOJ settlement, and then you went on to say there is going to be an impact overtime of the change of this consulting agreements, and so I was unclear as to what.", "Jim Crines", "Okay", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "You are trying to say", "Jim Crines", "Well, I do think it\u2019s going to be a dynamic environment. It certainly has been over the course of the last seven months or so, but I think that you\u2019re going to see medical device businesses in general revisiting these issues, and it\u2019s one of the reasons that we\u2019re coming out with a strong move in this area to clarify how we are going to collaborate with Surgeons. We think that collaboration is extraordinarily important both to the development of the right products and then training surgeons on the safe and effective of use of those products. ", "So, we want to continue to collaborate but we want to structure those relationships in a way that inspires confidence and trust among all the stake holders that are going to be scrutinizing those collaborations on a go forward basis and so that can come in a number of different forms. It could be how we fund those initiatives, for instance we want a take any of our charitable giving and general medical education support and put those funds in the hands of a third party, so that can be disseminated in a manner that doesn\u2019t even give the appearance of a impropriety. And, it\u2019s also going to come about in the form revisiting both structure and compensation arrangements within those collaborative arrangements, whether it\u2019s training and education or under design surgeon side ", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "To what degree do you think there is going to be a longer term impact on R&D, if you are unable to going to work with doctor\u2019s in the same manner that you have in the past. Do you expect to have difficulties kind of on the innovation side on R&D productivity? And, do you expect over the longer-term mix implications from any of the changes in the consulting agreement?", "Jim Crines", "Our first priority is to continue to put out best in class products and address unmet clinical needs. What it may involve overtime is a repositioning of those, of that dollar spends. So, that if there are certain surgeon services that are important to those collaborative efforts into development of the right products that the people are scrutinizing heavily, you may bring those resources inside even in an extreme. But, I don\u2019t see that this is going to have any negative impact on our ability to put great products out and to train people properly on those products.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Last question, can you update on the Hip Resurfacing? I apologize if I missed that.", "Jim Crines", "Yeah, we had as we pointed on in the past Kristen, working down two pass, one is to submit PMA with foreign data and the other is to complete a US Id. We have recently experienced some delays on both fronts. We would now sort of project the earliest that we would be on the market with the hip resurfacing device in the US is 2011. Given that positioned our sales and marketing, our product development efforts are going remained focused on addressing the other 90% of the hip market here in near term.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Does that change your expectations for your underlying hip growth?  In the last year you were talking about how that was going to be an impact? Do you, how confident are you that you can sustain higher underlying growth rates in hip as we move out this year above kind of where you are in this recent quarter?", "Jim Crines", "No, it does not change our view, as we pointed out in our last call, we are tracking very carefully on an account basis very closely by the, our performance on the unit basis and we continue to view our opportunity with respect to our primary hip portfolio in a way that sort of how this is keeping face with market growth.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "You're contrary to what you thought last year, your expectations for Hip resurfacing or maybe a loss of an impact, now of it to what you thought back in October?", "Jim Crines", "I think that's fair and again that's consistent with we had pointed out on the last call as well.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Jim Crines", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Michael Jungling with Merrill Lynch.", "Michael Jungling - Merrill Lynch", "Great thank you taking my questions. I have three. The first one is in relation to hedging losses. Can I just confirm from the last discussion in the Q4 call, whether you still believe that the impact from hedging losses will go away in the second half of 2008, and also into 2009 or have you had to re-hedge and therefore that pain could be extended for a longer period of time? Secondly on SG&A, can I just confirm that the monitoring cost in the quarter were around $8 million, and as you can also comment on perhaps some of the precise details why SG&A to sales has gone from 37.4 in the fourth quarter to 39.7 adjusted for your changes in compensation expenditures inline with the fact that we've seen a reduction in selling or entertainment expenses both at the annual meeting in Boston, and at the WS meeting in San Francisco. And, the third question I have is in dental, can you comment or where that the US market for dental implants has seen a sharp or more difficulties from the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year? It'll be great, thank you.", "Yeah, and Michael this is Jim. I'll cover the first couple of questions that you had. First of all in the hedging losses, I think as I pointed out in the past, we layer these hedges in overtime, and so on a month-by-month basis we are looking at anywhere from 18 to 24 months and layering in new hedge contract to cover off projected cash flow exposures that we have. So, we would not anticipate the hedge losses that are tapering off particularly not to the extent that dollar has continued to weaken in the second half of '08. At some point the dollar stabilizes and you anniversary out of those hedge losses, but it would not be in the second half of '08. ", "With respect to your question on SG&A, the monitor fees as we pointed out are within the range that we guided to you, they are not going to give us specific number, but again I would just point out that they are within the range that we guided to. And if you look at over the balance of the year, between monitor fees and other outside service fees that we are incurring on the enhanced compliance and ethics initiatives, we would expect to be at the high-end of that $0.02 to $0.03 range that we guided to. ", "And then regarding the SG&A ratio for the quarter, that really is a function of all the things that we discussed on the fourth quarter call coming in to the year. In terms of the infrastructure and the operating initiatives that we had outlined, that includes the monitor fees and expenses, that includes the increased cost associated with getting more instruments out in to the field in the US, that includes sort of an enhanced commission opportunity to bring more focus to our trauma product line within our core market here in the US and also investments in sales force infrastructure and our global businesses in dental, in trauma outside the US. ", "So those are some of the things again that we had outlined on our fourth quarter call coming in to the year that are contributing to that increase in the SG&A ratio. ", "David Dvorak", "And I would say that, with respect to your question on the dental market, we have seen a continued slowing of the US market that is progression that has continued through last year and in to this year. ", "Michael Jungling - Merrill Lynch", "And just a quick follow-up on the SG&A side. Can I just confirm that the increase in the first quarter in the ratio was the investment in capital equipment, so the amortization and depreciation of sales samples, was that a key driver or was it more the other things that you mentioned such as investment and sales goal, monitoring cost and fees etcetera. Thank you.", "Jim Crines", "It's a pretty significant contributor, the increased depreciation on the instruments that are being put out in the field. But again monitor fees and expenses are also contributing to that increase.  ", "Michael Jungling - Merrill Lynch", "Right. Thank you. ", "Jim Crines", "Thank you. Okay. ", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Brue Nudell with UBS", "David Dvorak ", "Hello Bruce. ", "Operator", "Sir we are not hearing your question. Please check you mute button. ", "Bruce Nudell - UBS", "Good morning, I am sorry. The most interesting thing about the quarter reported so far was that the US hip market last year was double-digits. This year with everybody reporting it seems to be around 4% selling day aside may be 5%. Unit have averaged about 3%, 4% over the last six seven years barring '07 perhaps. Could you get a feel for why the market was so robust last year as oppose to assuming a more traditional type of revenue growth this year.", "Jim Crines", "Bruce, this is Jim. I think that when you're looking at the market, there have been over the last couple of year, I think, there have been a number of companies that have been able to increase their penetration with their alternate bearing offerings, much specifically metal-on-metal, that price represents frankly an opportunity going forward that\u2019s contributed to pretty significant mix benefit. And as obviously, those companies achieve higher levels of penetration with those devices at some point, they anniversary out of that mix opportunity and you see results falling sort of back in line with unit, something closer to unit growth.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS", "Thanks so much on that. And looking at the categories and after kind of adjusting for your taking cement out of hips, were there any categories in US or all US hips where you felt you maybe lagging the market this quarter?", "Jim Crines", "I would say we have seen a bit of competitive pressure in our revision hip line. There is some instrument issues there, that we're fully aware and are addressing with development efforts. And I would tell you those sales were somewhat weak in the quarter.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS", "But basically, you think for all the categories you're within a point of the market, US or US hips and knees?", "David Dvorak", "Putting hip resurfacing aside on a unit basis, yes.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS", "Okay. And with the $70 million to $80 million hip to top-line this year, we had called you, when we were trying to figure out the EPS impact and, we were kind of told that it was at the lower end of the margins scale of your product line. But just doing a quick calculation, it looks like the incremental operating margins to explain 11% to 13% have to be quite high, well north of 40%. Was there disconnect, or we just missed here.", "Jim Crines", "It\u2019s all relative. These are lower margin products relative to hips and knees, but still healthy margins.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS", "Okay, and then Dave a more strategic question. I think that you guys have taken the lead on the compliance front. I think you\u2019ve probably set the standard for doctor company relationships going forward. But, assuming everybody comes to the level that you are hoping to establish and we look out, it could make for a more fluid market share environment. And, so when you sit back and think about the strategic plan for the company and given the dominant market share position you have in hips and knees, how much, just to kind of speak to the level of risk, how much share do you think is at risk due to potentially a more fluid environment when you say, how much should I invest in hips and knees versus spine and dental and trauma?", "David Dvorak", "Yeah, I think, that our core business is one that we are very optimistic. We can continue to expand our leadership with respect to and that's part of the reason that we're making those adjustments and establishing an appropriate standard for this collaborative relationship on a go-forward basis. These product decisions need to be made in accordance with what's in the patient\u2019s interest and the vast, vast majority, hopefully all of the surgeons that we do business with our making decisions because they firmly believe that these products that we produce provide them with the best opportunity to do right by their patients. ", "And that's the basis upon which we want to compete. It\u2019s the basis upon which we compete everyday and we do that successfully. On a go forward basis, we're going to continue to be very effective with developing great solutions to address unmet clinical needs and training the surgeons on the proper use of those products. So I don't see any risk component to that. It\u2019s just going to come back to how effective we are developing the right solutions and marketing and selling those products. ", "Bruce Nudell - UBS", "I guess just the final thought on that issue, does the OUS experience with regards to surgeon loyalty or I don't believe there are nearly as many consultancies etcetera tell you anything about the degree to which share loyalty is driven by instrumentation, and great service, and products.", "David Dvorak", "It\u2019s instructive, but the US isn't instructive as well Bruce. I mean, there are thousands and thousands of surgeons that select our products and resulting in millions of our implants being used every year, and we don't have any relationship with those surgeons beyond a pure customer relationship. So that\u2019s the basis upon which most of the surgeons have always made their decisions and we're the leader in that market, so we're really comfortable with our ability to compete in that world going forward.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS", "Thanks so much.", "David Dvorak", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bill Plovanic, with Canaccord Adams.", "Bill Plovanic - Canaccord Adams", "Great, thank you. On the OSP business, how much of that do you expect to come back online? If you are loosing $70 million over the course of the year, what do we end up getting back at the end of the day, considering you are discontinuing some of these products?", "Jim Crines", "We, it comes back in faces over the balance of the year Bill, and we haven't obviously put an operating plan together for 2009. So, there will be some challenges, obviously the competitors that are getting into those accounts, where we have lost that business. We are going to work hard to get it back, but I honestly couldn\u2019t tell you at this point, when it\u2019s all set and done, how much of that business we are going to get back.", "David Dvorak", "But just to clarify, Bill, that we aren\u2019t discontinuing products. Those remediation efforts are intended to bring the products back online. So, there is no discontinuation plan.", "Bill Plovanic - Canaccord Adams", "Okay. And then, if I just did a little back of the napkin math here, in some of your comments that US Hip business, 4% up in the first quarter excluding the less days was in line with the last year. If I kind of run some of the numbers with demands up 24% year-over-year, I am just trying to, it looks like the hip number, what I am trying to get at here is actually reported number is about inline with expectations when you back out, just a math, as you push it to OSP. Question is, OSP, this is the first quarter you are reporting it in and this is the first quarter you are reporting cement in the OSP line, correct?", "David Dvorak", "That\u2019s correct.", "Bill Plovanic - Canaccord Adams", "So, and in the US Hip business, instead of growing 9% last year, it grew about 4% to 5%, if you back the cement out, is that pretty fair when we see those numbers?", "Jim Crines", "Yeah. Our first quarter in hips, excluding bone cement in 2007 would have been 4.3%.", "Bill Plovanic - Canaccord Adams", "Okay. The bone cement with in the US, somewhere around $65ish million last year. Am I backing into numbers pretty\u2026?", "Jim Crines", "For the full year? You are in the neighborhood.", "Bill Plovanic - Canaccord Adams", "Okay. And then just secondly, what\u2019s the cost of the credit facility? If you are taking on $500 million in you are buying back stock, just so that we can do the numbers, how much do you think that\u2019s going to cost you and what are you getting on your cash balances these days?", "Jim Crines", "Yeah, while I've, we had indicated on the call that we on the $500 million, we are projecting about $10 million of interest cost pre-tax for the balance of the year.", "Bill Plovanic - Canaccord Adams", "Okay. Then what are your cash balances earning you right now?", "Jim Crines", "It\u2019s somewhere in the order of 2% to 2.5%.", "Bill Plovanic - Canaccord Adams", "Right, great. That\u2019s all I had, thanks a lot.", "Jim Crines", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Philip Lezlie [ph] with Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Philip Lezlie - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Hi, there. Quick question on the Mobile Bearing Knees, you mentioned Mobile Bearing and Flex knee together were about 10%, what was Mobile Bearing just on a standalone basis as a percentage of sales?", "David Dvorak", "Yes, that\u2019s a detail that we're not going to disclose.", "Philip Lezlie - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. How about, how much have you disclosed, how much of a premium you get on the Mobile Bearing Knee?", "David Dvorak", "No, we wouldn\u2019t provide that type of breakdown. I mean the Mobile Bearing opportunity is significant. What we have right now cleared is a product that probably can compete effectively and about half the US opportunity. If you assume that that is about the 15% of the overall knee market, it\u2019s a bit over $300 million. So, take half of that number and that\u2019s the opportunity I would tell you that at this point in time is obviously an insignificant percentage, but the product was just launched and as we stated previously, we expect our ability to seize that opportunity to ramp up over the course of the second half of the year.", "Philip Lezlie  - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And, then I wanted to maybe follow-up a bit on Bruce's question earlier. In terms of how you are, you are taking a leadership position on the physician consultant issue. How different do you think your position will end up being from how your competitors choose that?", "David Dvorak", "I wouldn't suspect that at the end of day it will be significantly differenct, but I can't project out for you Phil with any certain as to what kind of a time lag there maybe is applied to either this sector or the broader medical device industry.", "Philip Lezlie - Thomas Weisel Partners", "But do have a sense that I mean, you must be talking to physician already, do have a sense that your actions are sort of more draconian for lack of a better word or is everybody kind of on the same page here?", "David Dvorak", "Well I think that directionally there is a lot of consistency here and this a unique circumstance in the sense of the leaders in this sector are all under similar terms because of the deferred non-prosecution agreements that they entered into and there is a stated objective by the department of justice and the monitors that are working with them to ensure that there is a level plain field. So, I think within this sector, people are directionally on the same page. We're making these decisions in a very principled way. We don't want to incrementalize this initiative. We want to make sure that any adjustments that we make, we're making these adjustments once, and we believe that that's going serve for the long-term interest of the company and the surgeons that we work with and the patients that they serve. So, we're very confident that we're doing the right thing, and as for the other companies, we'll have to see what pace they come along.", "Philip Lezlie  - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Thanks very much.", "David Dvorak", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "At this time there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Dvorak, for any additional or closing comments.", "David Dvorak", "Okay, thanks Laurie. And thank you everyone for joining us today and for your continued interest in Zimmer. We look forward to speaking you on our second quarter conference call, which will be held on Thursday, July 24th, at 8:00 a.m. Have a great day.", "Operator", "Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen.

I would like to welcome you to the Zimmer second quarter 2008 earnings conference call. ", "Joining me today to host this call are David Dvorak, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Crines, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Cheryl Blanchard, Senior Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, who is joining us today to assist in responding to your questions with regard to Durom.", "This morning, we\u2019ll review our performance for the second quarter; provide you with an update on certain key issues to include those which involve our Durom product; present an update to our outlook for 2008, and conclude our discussion with a question-and-answer session.", "Before we get started, I would like to point out that this presentation contains forward-looking statements within the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the orthopedic industry, management\u2019s beliefs, and assumptions made by management. ", "These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.", "For a list and description of the risks and uncertainties, see the disclosure materials filed by Zimmer with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Zimmer disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.", "This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of such information to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, along with other financial and statistical information for the periods to be presented on this conference call, was included in the press release announcing our earnings, which may be accessed from the Zimmer website at www.zimmer.com under the section entitled Investor Relations.", "A rebroadcast of this call will be available from approximately two hours following the conclusion of today\u2019s call through the end of the day on August 6, 2008 and can also be accessed from the Investor Relations section of the Zimmer website.", "At this time, I would like to introduce David Dvorak, President and Chief Executive Officer of Zimmer.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you, Paul, and good morning everyone. As we begin, I want to first thank you all for making the scheduling adjustment to join us this morning. I hope that you can appreciate the priority we recognized in announcing the results of our Durom Cup investigation and in initiating the steps required to communicate to surgeons.", "Our first concern is patient safety and we could not delay our Durom announcement. Of course, our voluntary action with respect to the Durom Cup will have financial consequences. Therefore, accelerating the timing of our earnings release was necessary. ", "We wanted to make that information available to you and the investment community and answer questions as soon as we could. So that brings us together here today one day earlier than we originally planned.", "This morning, as Paul stated, in addition to reviewing our overall results for the quarter, we\u2019ll provide you with additional detail on the Durom matter; update guidance for the year, and report on the progress we\u2019re making in furtherance of the strategic priorities we previously outlined.", "Throughout these discussions, I hope you\u2019ll recognize the pattern in the way we face difficult issues. We\u2019ve made decisions that we believe will best prepare Zimmer to compete effectively in the expanding markets of the future. ", "Where we need to make improvements, we want the changes to be long-lasting and sustainable. We\u2019re absolutely committed to positioning Zimmer to thrive for years to come.", "With that as context, I\u2019d like to review our second quarter results. Consolidated sales for the quarter of $1.080 billion were up 11.2% over the prior year\u2019s second quarter and 5.5% in constant currency, and we generated 5% growth in adjusted earnings per share. ", "Our sales results, acknowledging an additional billing day in the quarter, were led by strong underlying growth in Knee unit sales with excellent balance across all of our geographic Knee segments. ", "Asia-Pacific led all territories with 14% constant currency growth in Knees, despite a challenging price environment, especially in Japan.", "Hip sales growth was consistent with our first quarter. Some of other business franchises, however, experienced a deceleration in sales growth and we\u2019ll talk more about that.", "The weakening U.S. dollar favorably impacted our top line growth. This favorable impact on our top line is essentially neutralized on the bottom line due to our hedging program.", "During the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $281 million and we used $496 million to repurchase 6.9 million shares. Jim will discuss specific details of our financial results and stock repurchase program activity in a few minutes.", "As we communicated last night, we have completed an extensive investigation into the performance of the Durom Cup here in the United States, following reports of cup loosening and revisions of the acetabular component in some patients who have undergone total hip replacement. ", "While many U.S. surgeons have had success with the Durom Cup since its launch in 2006, a subset have experienced elevated revision rates. This observation clearly contrasts ongoing positive clinical experience in Europe, where the product has been available since 2003.", "We launched a rigorous investigation, which included a thorough review of manufacturing processes, design specifications, production documentation, and clinical experience in the U.S. and Europe. Based on the results of that investigation, we will temporarily suspend marketing and distribution of the Durom Cup in the U.S.  ", "We\u2019ll update labeling to provide more detailed surgical technique instructions to surgeons and prepare to implement a comprehensive surgical technique training program for the U.S.", "We have reviewed our investigation and conclusions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and are actively communicating with surgeons now through multiple channels to explain this field action, and identify and address their related needs. ", "We are also communicating with customers around the world to clarify that the Durom Cup will continue to be marketed and distributed outside the United States without interruption.", "Our primary objective in taking prompt action based on results of our Durom investigation is to ensure better clinical outcomes for patients. We believe that the likelihood of currently implanted patients requiring revisions is low. ", "But we want to make sure that we\u2019re clear with our U.S. surgeons that they should stop implanting the Durom Cup until we issue the updated labeling that provides more detailed guidance on surgical technique and until they receive training.", "We also of course want to make sure we support surgeons in every way we can as we implement these actions. With this goal in mind, we\u2019ll provide clinical management guidelines to assist surgeons in the ongoing evaluation of patients currently implanted with the Durom Cup. ", "Within the next several weeks, we\u2019ll issue a further communication to U.S. surgeons that provides them with updated labeling, including more detailed surgical technique instructions.", "We also are working with experts in Europe and the United States to develop a robust surgical skills training curriculum. Following initiation of the new training program, the Durom Cup will be made available to U.S. surgeons again as they complete training.", "We are confident that these measures are the prudent and responsible course of action and we are committed to conducting them in a manner that demonstrates our deep commitment to patients and our customers.", "I\u2019d now like to spend a few minutes providing an update on the investments that we are making at Zimmer that will help drive operational and earnings leverage and growth in the future. We made good progress during the quarter on our quality systems upgrades.", "With respect to our Orthopedic Surgical Products operation in Dover, Ohio, our remediation plans continue as scheduled and we expect to have most, if not all, of the OSP products back in production by the end of this year, many in the next two or three months.", "We also made good progress with our global IT system project during the quarter, which will allow us to apply technological efficiencies across our entire business infrastructure. ", "During the quarter, we continued to work on a new Zimmer facility in Shannon, Ireland, and have begun hiring and training the management team that will operate this facility in early 2009.", "We also announced the planned addition of 50,000 square feet of foundry operations in Warsaw, Indiana, that is expected to increase our annual output by 1.3 million castings. Further, we announced plans to add approximately 100,000 square feet of manufacturing space to our Winterthur, Switzerland facility. ", "We feel it\u2019s imperative to make these investments today in order to serve the anticipated increase in global demand for our products in the coming years.", "For the past couple of quarters, we\u2019ve explained the processes of coming to and working through the impacts of our resolution agreements with the U.S. government and how we expect those agreements and related initiatives will shape the future growth of our industry. ", "We\u2019re taking the time and making the investments now to put this challenge behind us and ensure that we have a sustainable global business model for collaboration with surgeons that will not be disrupted in the future.", "During the quarter, Jim, Cheryl, and I, as well as many other members of our senior management team personally met with over 100 surgeons. We explained the chronology of events of the past year or so, where we are today, and how we believe our surgeon relationships will carry forward. ", "While this process certainly has not been easy and we have addressed many tough and fair questions, I will tell you that it is great to be re-engaged with our surgeon community. ", "The surgeons we have met with are principally concerned about the quality of care for patients. They generally support our efforts to employ greater discipline around company/surgeon collaboration and are enthusiastic about the resumption of these activities. ", "While we have more to do, we\u2019re making great progress towards what we believe will be much more efficient and effective relationships in the future. We at Zimmer understand and appreciate the importance of these collaborative relationships and the benefit that they have provided thousands, if not millions, of patients worldwide.", "We resumed U.S. hip and knee surgeon training courses during the quarter and we\u2019ll continue to provide this critical surgeon support not only at the Zimmer Institute in Warsaw, but at various regional training centers throughout the world. ", "This is another example of where we\u2019re taking the time and making the investment to create lasting and sustainable change. Our training activities will ramp out throughout the remainder of 2008, and we\u2019ll enter 2009 with a state-of-the-art training capability and an aggressive schedule for supporting our new product introductions.", "We\u2019ve taken on the challenge of executing several important strategic initiatives concurrently and it has been a monumental endeavor. I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to personally thank the many employees, distributors, and sales representatives who have displayed their commitment and dedication to Zimmer through their tireless efforts in this process.", "I\u2019ll now turn to our updated guidance for the full year 2008. Jim will provide more details momentarily. Due to the developments in the second quarter, including Durom, we are revising our expectations for 2008 full year sales growth to 4.5% to 5% constant currency. We are also lowering our adjusted earnings guidance for the full year to be between $4.05 and $4.10 per fully diluted share.", "We naturally are disappointed to be making these adjustments. However, with regard to earnings guidance, alternative responses would have compromised momentum on strategic operational and infrastructure initiatives. We believe our response to these challenges will make it possible to deliver fully on the future promise of our business.", "As we look to the future, it is with a focus on the potential of our business to drive not only our growth, but to help Zimmer achieve an enduring leadership position in healthcare. ", "We\u2019re developing our business to help move our company more deeply into high potential areas where our strategic assets can make a difference in musculoskeletal health in ways that address some of the most important needs of both aging populations and challenged healthcare systems.", "The market opportunity for our business is sizeable, and our 2009 strategic and operating plans will focus on leveraging our infrastructure and technology platforms across our various business franchises to grow share. ", "We also look forward to restoring positive earnings leverage in 2009 with the expectation of achieving at least low double digit adjusted earnings per share growth.", "Jim will now provide further details on the quarter and our guidance. ", "James Crines", "Thanks, David. I will review our performance in the quarter in more detail and then provide some additional information related to our guidance. ", "Sales of $1.080 billion for the quarter represent an increase of 11.2% reported and 5.5% constant currency. These results among other things reflect the benefit of one additional selling day in the quarter compared to same period in the prior year; strong underlying unit growth in Knees in all three of operating segments; and lower OSP, Durom, and dental product sales.", "A weaker U.S. dollar persisted during the quarter and as compared with the prior year added 6% or $56 million in revenue in the quarter. As expected, consolidated pricing was essentially flat for the quarter. ", "In the Americas, as was the case in the first quarter, price contributed 0.6 point to growth. In Europe, price was 0.2 point negative versus 0.5 point negative during the first quarter, with Germany and Italy reporting low single digit reductions in average selling prices, while other markets in Europe were flat or slightly positive.

I was wondering if you could quantify the three main areas and the impact that you\u2019re seeing this year and what percentage of that could disappear in 2009? I would love it if you could hit Durom, OSP, and the compliance monitors.", "James Crines", "I\u2019ll start with OSP. As David indicated and I indicated in my comments, we\u2019re on schedule with our remediation efforts; expect to be back in production of those patient care products between now and the end of the year, and have the opportunity to go back into the market as those products come back online. ", "Going into 2009, we would look to get back as much of that 70 to $80 million that we lost as we possibly can. We wouldn\u2019t expect to get it all back, but we\u2019ll certainly be back in the market with those products and pursuing opportunities to regain share in that segment.", "Concerning the fees and expenses, we are looking now at a total in 2008 of 50 to $60 million in fees associated with the global rollout of our enhanced compliance program. ", "As I indicated in my comments, we will have the opportunity as we develop our plans for 2009 as we put the work that is being done this year behind us, to either reinvest that 50 to $60 million in training and development activities or deliver savings to the bottom line. ", "I think to some degree, we certainly understand what the target is going into the operating plan, as David referenced the fact that we are targeting at least low double digit growth in earnings in 2009. ", "Again, as we work through the plans for 2009, that will dictate how much of that gets reinvested as opposed to how much gets delivered to the bottom line.", "David Dvorak", "And finally, Tao, on Durom, certainly as we go into 2009, we are going to have our full training courses up and running, and we will have passed the point where we\u2019d be able to allow surgeons to use that product again within the United States market. ", "I think that in this quarter that activity will be ramping up. We will start with reissuing the surgical technique instructions and then taking people through the training courses that are being developed currently. ", "As we get into the fourth quarter, I\u2019d expect those courses to be fully up and running and so we\u2019d have greater visibility as to what that revenue stream in the metal-on-metal area is going to look like as we march into 2009 probably and be able to provide you with a more meaningful update on the next quarter call.", "Also, I think it is going to be important to note even though it wasn\u2019t one of the three items that you mentioned, that our training courses are going to be up and running in full by the time we exit 2008, and that is going to help our revenue streams in some of these other business units. ", "We obviously made Hips and Knees the priority; got those courses back up and running on the surgical skill side during the second quarter beginning in May. We have about I think 40 courses already scheduled on the surgical skill side between now and the end of the year in that area. ", "But these activities are going to ramp up in the other business units, most importantly on the Dental side as well as Spine. We will see the benefits of the re-initiation of those activities too as we go into 2009.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank ", "Great, thank you very much. That was really helpful.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from Bruce Nudell - UBS.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS ", "I have two questions. The first pertains to Durom itself. In your background, you mentioned 1.5% failure rate for people who knew what they were doing and around 6% for groups that really weren\u2019t following the protocol exactly. ", "What is the anticipated aggregate early revision rate with the product given the disparities in training? How much reputational damage could that cause given the 13,000 implants that have taken place to date?", "David Dvorak", "I am going to let Cheryl respond to that question, Bruce.", "Cheryl Blanchard", "I think the best way to answer that question is first of all to understand that what our analysis tells us to date is that the likelihood of currently implanted patients requiring revision is going to be low. ", "In our detailed analysis of the clinical aspects of those investigations, you did see in the background piece that in the group that had success with the device that they had about a 1.5% revision rate while the other groups were at 5.7%. ", "It\u2019s very difficult for us to project out where we think those numbers are going to go eventually. What I can tell you is that we were able to discern that there were some specific elements of surgical technique and cup placement that are the items that really make the difference in terms of those clinical outcomes.", "I think it\u2019s difficult to comment on the last part of your question, which is reputational damage. I think that that will frankly be determined by the actions that we\u2019ve taken today and our level of being proactive as we move forward, trying to work with surgeons to help them get through this difficult situation with their patients. ", "We absolutely recognize that for those patients that are involved that there will be some items that we will need to help them with and we are going to be proactive about that.", "David Dvorak", "Let me add, Bruce, that the initial responses that we\u2019ve received from surgeons have been understanding of the decision and appreciative of the way that we\u2019re conducting ourselves to put them in the best position to take care of their patients. ", "I think that the early results are that people see this as being the prudent thing to do under the circumstances, and that always is going to be the best thing for the company\u2019s reputation.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS ", "My follow-up question would be pertaining to the big fear that investors have about the stock is that the new DOJ rules exacerbated by Durom, let\u2019s say, are likely to result in a more fluid marketplace and share loss.  ", "In the quarter, it looks as though Knees U.S., ex-U.S., and ex-U.S. Hips were in line with the market and it sounds like most of what happened in U.S. Hips was Durom. ", "Could you comment with regards to scale of the anticipated shortfall this year in revenues, which looks like $60 million plus or so, $30 million of which are Durom? How much of that is anticipating share loss, and do you really feel that that\u2019s a major risk at this point in time in your key Hip and Knee business?", "James Crines", "I would agree with the way you characterize our performance in the quarter. We have not seen share loss, absent what we may be losing with respect to large diameter head metal-on-metal offering within the Hip segment, and we\u2019re obviously not participating in the resurfacing in the U.S.. But outside of that, we\u2019re not seeing share loss in our core franchise.", "I will run through for you in a bit more detail the adjustment to our expectations relative to what they were coming into the year in the update that we provided on the first quarter call. ", "It\u2019s an adjustment, as you pointed out, of 60 to $80 million in total, including the 25 to $30 million in Hips, related principally to Durom, but acknowledging as well the slower uptake on new products in the Hip franchise. ", "For us, that would include the Kinective technology, the Fitmore stem, a bone conserving stem that we\u2019re just in the process of launching, and even the Epic stem that we\u2019re looking to get cleared for commercial sale in the U.S. within the back half for the year.", "About a $10 million adjustment to our expectations on Knees, representing really some lost opportunity for above market growth, and that is associated with again new products, in this case our Mobile Bearing knee, the Gender Solutions N-K Flex, and our Patello-femoral joint.  ", "In Extremities, about a $5 million adjustment, and there again related to some disruption in training associated with our new TM Inverse/Reverse shoulder system.", "In Dental, about a $15 million adjustment to our expectations; clearly this business and you can see it in the results reported for the quarter in the U.S., has perhaps been most affected by this transition to this enhanced compliance program and we\u2019re working through that with the Dental organization.  ", "In Trauma, about a 5 to $10 million adjustment in our expectations. Trauma admittedly is not so much associated with new products. There is knowledge there that we continue to see competitor pressure on our Nail system, and we\u2019ll really not be able to effectively address that until we come out with a new Nail, which I indicated we expect to have in limited release in 2009.", "Finally Spine, about a 5 to $10 million adjustment; that related to the disruption we have been talking about in surgical skills training and associated in this case with Dynesys, Atavi, and TiTLE 2 principally.", "David Dvorak", "Bruce, let me come back to your core theme there and I think it is a really important one for us. We have made decisions that we weren\u2019t going to incrementalize this change with respect to the surgeon collaborative relationships. ", "As we previously announced, we went beyond the four corners of the DPA and the CI that we entered into last September. The point of that from the company\u2019s strategy and with respect to our future is that we want make sure that we are able to collaborate with surgeons in all the essential ways that are most important, from the patient\u2019s perspective especially. ", "That includes collaborating to develop the next generation of great products that address unmet clinical meets. It also includes having the very best training and education program out there.", "Those are areas that we are very focused on. We don\u2019t want to see disruption to these business units going forward. We are biting the bullet now to make that change and it will be a permanent change. But we believe that we are going to be operating in the market that everyone else is going to ultimately come to operate in, whether they do that voluntarily or involuntarily. ", "So it\u2019s disruptive in the short term, but we firmly believe that it\u2019s the right long-term strategy for the business. We really are confident that that\u2019s going to prove out.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS ", "I appreciate that. Just to clarify, are the new product issues in Hips, Knees, Extremities, Dental, and Spine, are those principally related to training, other than Durom?", "James Crines", "It is. Particularly when you look at what it takes in the case of some of these new products that surgeons are unfamiliar with and we look to able to get into a either cadaver-based surgical skills training program or live surgery before they would be willing to use the device.", "David Dvorak", "You can think of that too, Bruce, in the context of something like Kinectiv technology or our Inverse/Reverse shoulders, and even Dynesys within the spine field. Those are products that surgeons aren\u2019t going to be comfortable adopting until they have had that training. ", "Frankly, we wouldn\u2019t want them to. So that is the point that Jim has referenced in his prepared remarks about the uptake on those new products and it was also noted in our earnings release that went out last night.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS ", "That\u2019s very helpful, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners ", "I was curious if I could just clarify; did you mention it was 25 to $30 million this year in other income?", "James Crines", "I did.", "Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners ", "I think you said there was some sale of products or assets in that. Can you maybe give us a little more detail on that?", "James Crines", "I am not going to go into specific details on that, Raj. That\u2019s why I gave guidance on that line item. I have pointed out that it includes both interest expense on our borrowings including the $220 million drawdown on our credit facility as well as gains, both the $8.7 million gain on sale of certain other assets, as well as additional anticipated one-time gains related to further sales of other assets we would look to accomplish in the back half of the year.", "Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners ", "Okay, but no detail of what those assets are?", "James Crines", "No.", "Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners ", "Okay, if I could just ask a couple of clarification questions as well on the surgeon training program. Are you requiring that surgeons attend a hands-on training course before they can resume implantation of Durom in the U.S.?", "David Dvorak", "Some form of training will be required; that\u2019s right.", "Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners ", "Okay, and those courses, as you mentioned, they will come online towards the end of the year. So until that time, there should be no expectation for any sales of that product at all in the U.S.?", "David Dvorak", "We expect to have those courses up and running over the course of the next several weeks, Raj. We would expect revenues to come back online in advance of the end of the year. ", "But obviously we\u2019ll have to see how things go on the uptake of those products as they\u2019re reintroduced after the training, and we\u2019ll provide you with a more full update as we enter in the third quarter call.", "Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners ", "Okay, and then just one broad one. I think you have mentioned several times you\u2019re holding the company to a higher standard I think than maybe it had been previously in other companies were holding themselves to, with the voluntary recall in USB product, the voluntary withdrawal of Durom, your reworking of the surgeon relationships. ", "You mention that you expect this over time to be something that provides you with an advantage. Maybe I\u2019m putting words in your mouth, but over time this will work in your favor. ", "I\u2019m curious how you imagine that to play out. Is it that other companies over time will have to come up to where you are; whether it will be perceived in the marketplace that you are a company that people want to do business with, or really how does that advantage actually work to your favor over time?", "David Dvorak", "Obviously, trust is absolutely essential within this business. Whether it comes up in the context of these collaborative relationships; in the public\u2019s view; in the enforcement agency\u2019s view of how those relationships are structured and managed, that\u2019s critical. ", "I think that the same theme applies in the context of making responsible decisions with respect to the products that we introduce and the benefits that those products provide to patients and how we take care of the relationships that we have with surgeons. ", "Our reputation and the trust that people place in us is going to be key to the future success of the company. We treat that matter very, very carefully and with a lot of protective steps in place to ensure that that trust is in no respect impaired.", "I think on the collaborative relationship side, over the course of the next 5, 8, 10 years, what you\u2019re going to see is that companies within medical devices that believe that collaborative relationships with physicians are key to their future; are going to have to implement systems that are not all that dissimilar to the quality systems that have been implemented in these medical device companies over the last many years to protect the ability to be able to collaborate with surgeons on a go-forward basis. ", "The enforcement agencies are going to expect those programs to be in place, and I suspect that they are going to allocate their enforcement resources in a way where obviously it\u2019s going to be risk based analysis, and they will comment and evaluate the compliance programs and it will be very disruptive to a company that doesn\u2019t have the right program in place. ", "I think that as the surgeon community becomes better informed as to those risks, they\u2019re going to want to collaborate with the companies that have those protective systems in place. I think it\u2019s going to rig down to our benefit in that regard as well.", "Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners ", "Great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from Michael Jungling - Merrill Lynch.", "Michael Jungling - Merrill Lynch ", "I have three questions. Firstly on the royalty payment that you delayed; are you in the breach of contract with physicians and have doctors taken legal action against you from selling products that have got their technology?  ", "Secondly on Durom, the 20 to $30 million worth of sales, can you indicate how much that is in terms of annual sales?  I think it\u2019s pretty much the entire amount. ", "Thirdly on Dental, if you exclude bone augmentation products, what was the dental implant growth rate and how much competition did you see in Dental from generic competition or low cost providers? Thank you.", "David Dvorak", "I\u2019ll pick up with the royalty question to begin with. Let me tell you that, we have done a lot of work and are making a lot of progress to bring those payments back on line. It is the case that we are in arrears with those payments. ", "We have communicated very actively with the involved third parties. We have a lot of resources committed to this, including some of those third-party resources that Jim referenced earlier in the call.", "At this point in time, I do not see that our licensing rights are at significant risk. But we obviously have obligations that we need to make good on within the context of those contracts. I think that the progress that we are making will allow us to arrive at an appropriate resolution and be able to make those payments. ", "So those communications have really expanded over the last quarter, as have our progress steps in that regard. I think that we are doing the right things and we look to make significant progress between now and the end of the year with respect to making those payments.", "James Crines", "With regard to Durom, as we indicated in earlier comments, it represents about 5 to 10% of our Hip revenues in the U.S. It happens to be the case as well outside the U.S. If you look at how and we look at how that product was growing coming into the year, coming out of the first quarter before reports of loosenings and revisions, we were trending clearly to the high end of that range. ", "The 20 to $30 million, again, principally associated with Durom, does get you two-thirds to the full amount. But as I indicated, with regard to the Hip franchise, there is also the impact that some disruption in training is having on the new products that we have introduced in the Hip portfolio, namely the M/L Taper with Kinectiv. There is a bit more in the Epic devices that we\u2019re focused on in the second half of the year as well.", "David Dvorak", "Let me pick up on your Dental question as well, Michael. I think that you rattled off several factors that could be impacting the business. At this stage prior to the other companies reporting out on their second quarter performance, it\u2019s a little bit difficult for us to disaggregate those factors. ", "As we\u2019ve already mentioned, our training efforts on the physician training and education/clinician training and education side were impaired. We obviously had to prioritize our larger business units. But we\u2019re making good progress in that regard now. ", "We do think that that had a negative impact on our business. I think that there probably has been a continuation of the threat of some of the other providers, say the low-cost providers and low value providers within that marketplace. But I don\u2019t think that that has accelerated and justifies our poor performance within the U.S. marketplace.", "Anecdotally, it is true that we\u2019ve received some reports from the field that in certain large procedures where there are multiple implants, in instances people are moving from using four implants to two implants and then connecting the gaps with bridgework or more traditional dentistry, so that could be impacting it as well. ", "But I think that we\u2019ll need to carefully review the other companies\u2019 performances and we\u2019ll all learn more in the coming weeks on what\u2019s happening within the U.S. marketplace.", "There is no doubt that that marketplace is a bit more sensitive to the general economy because of the private pay basis for that business within the U.S. market, and so that has had an impact on the business as well. ", "But like I said, we\u2019ll gain greater visibility as the other companies report and be able to disaggregate those factors and think more intelligently about our actions going forward.", "Michael Jungling - Merrill Lynch ", "A quick follow-up question for you, Dave. I\u2019m still confused why you suspended the sale of Durom because if you look at all the registries around the world, the actual failure rate is roughly in line with best practice or in line with competing products. ", "You\u2019ll always have one- two- or three people who have higher failure rates because they haven\u2019t followed the procedure. Why recall it when all you would need to do is perhaps train 2-3-4-5 physicians that are having issues and not make it the problem of 500 physicians who are getting very, very good results?", "David Dvorak", "Again, we did not recall the product. The action that we\u2019re taking here is to step back, make sure that we can properly revise and add greater clarity to the surgical technique and the instructions for use on that product, and then make sure that everyone is trained. ", "We think that it\u2019s the responsible thing to do. One could deem it to be a conservative action, but when it comes to patient safety, we\u2019re going to make decisions on the conservative side of the continuum.", "Michael Jungling - Merrill Lynch ", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan.", "Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan ", "Let me just pick up on a couple of the items that have been discussed thus far. On Durom, probably two questions. One, how much do you think you will spend on surgeon training with the re-launch of the product in the United States? ", "Is it necessarily worth the expense and the distraction on your other products to re-launch this product in the U.S.?  And then how many surgeons do you think you\u2019ll need to train in order to get the product fully back out there?", "David Dvorak", "The spending is not going to be anything that\u2019s really out of the normal course for us. We incur a great deal of expense every year on surgeon training and education. It\u2019s a very important aspect of our business. ", "I wouldn\u2019t look for anything that is significant and conspicuous to come out the expenses that we incur in that regard. It will just be part of our overall effort on that side of our business.", "As far as the number of surgeons, there are several hundred within the U.S. I think that our records would indicate that there have been some 900 surgeons or approaching 1,000 surgeons. We would want to train several hundred surgeons. This will be an ongoing effort, not just in the coming quarter or two, but thereafter. ", "We do think that the product offers great patient benefits as evidenced by the clinical success that have obtained by many U.S. surgeons and the tens of thousands of patients that have had great results with this product overseas. ", "We believe that the metallurgy is superior to the competitive products that are out there, so it clearly is worth the investment, but we\u2019ve going to do this in a very responsible way, both to the surgeon customers and to the patients that receive these implants.", "Cheryl Blanchard", "Just as a point of clarification, the implants will be made available to the surgeons as they receive training. So there won\u2019t be a threshold that we train a certain number and then the implants became available. They will become available to individual surgeons as they receive their training.", "Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan ", "They have to go through the training first in order to start doing implants again?", "Cheryl Blanchard", "They do.", "Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan ", "Okay. David, one of my concerns here is that I see all that has happened, particularly in the last nine months between yourselves and surgeons and the way the relationship is evolving. This is true for Zimmer, but it\u2019s probably broadly true for the industry as well. Part of what you are talking about here is that the disruption on training and some of the other disruptions are having an impact on the uptake of the new technologies. ", "My question is, part of what we are seeing is that in the post-DTA world, that with changing relationships; less ability to influence surgeons; maybe less interest in surgeons on new technologies; fewer surgeons on your product development teams, why is it going forward, the uptake of new technology is going to be slower than we what we saw in the past?", "David Dvorak", "Mike, I don\u2019t think that the uptake of new technologies will be slower. I will tell you that I think that what we\u2019re going to right now is transitional in its nature and you\u2019re seeing this with not only our company but the competitors out in the field, either to a greater or lesser extent. ", "But I do think that what will be the case is that because of the strains placed upon the governmental systems and third-party payors to provide healthcare with a growing population of folks that need this care that the necessity of proving out the clinical benefits to new products, if you are going to expect to get mix benefit or price benefit more generally, is going to be more rigorous. ", "I think that what you are seeing on the uptake right now is probably a temporary transition as people work through the compliance with these resolution agreements. But I think that the long-term dynamic is going to dictate that you do have to prove out in a more rigorous way with empirical evidence that if you want to get a premium on a product, it has to prove out to provide greater patient benefits. ", "You see this in the discussions that are taking place within the U.S. on the reimbursement side and notions of comparative effectiveness. In some form for sure, you\u2019re going to see those types of principles be embedded in that decision-making. ", "What we want to be as an organization is a very innovative organization that addresses unmet clinical needs and have appropriate clinical data to be able to prove that out. And that\u2019s just what we are doing in allocating our R&D efforts. We believe that we\u2019re going to able to continue to compete very effectively and introduce innovative products going forward.", "Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan ", "Let me close with one final question for Jim. On the other income line, you\u2019re selling off some investments and some assets to help contribute/support 2008 earnings. Should I assume that in 2009 that other income line comes back to a more normalized level?", "James Crines", "Until such time as we prepare an operating plan for 2009, I\u2019d like to stay away from providing any specific guidance on 2009, Mike. But we have in what we disclosed been careful to make it very clear that what\u2019s running through that is one-time in nature.", "Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan ", "Okay, perfect, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ben Andrew - William Blair.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair ", "I just wanted to follow up with a couple of quick things. Is there any plan to accumulate clinical data related to Durom in the United States? You talked about the need for clinical evidence maybe with the registry or a broader study.", "Cheryl Blanchard", "What I can tell you is with respect to the ongoing experience and the experience that we will move forward with post-training that we will be continuing to very closely monitor the clinical experience with this device.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair ", "Okay, and then just more broadly speaking back to the training issue, clearly the disruptions and delays in being able to train and work with surgeons more closely is in basically every business. ", "Where is the confidence coming from that you\u2019re going to be able to see a quick restoration of the scope of relationship that you\u2019ve had surgeons historically as you\u2019ve been delaying that and disrupting those relationships as you get those pieces back in place; what timeframe should that be happening in?", "David Dvorak", "I think that we\u2019re going to make significant progress in the coming weeks and months, and I would expect that we will have fully transitioned and be up and running at a full clip before we exit this year. ", "With respect to the relationships that we have with the surgeons, there is a high desire among them to get back at these activities. As I mentioned, we\u2019ve had in-person meetings with over 100 surgeons just in the second quarter. The common theme among all of them is they want to ensure that patients\u2019 interests are protected. ", "They\u2019re very passionate about these activities; they\u2019re very passionate about the collaborative relationships and the benefits that they think are derived for their patients through those relationships. I don\u2019t anticipate that we\u2019re going to have any trouble at all at getting first-rate people signed back up to help us teach these courses and participate.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair ", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets ", "There are two questions. The first has to do with your communication with the FDA regarding Durom, and if you think that they will take some action towards this. The second question has to do with hip resurfacing. It\u2019s my understanding that the Durom hip cup is used as part of your resurfacing program. Does this delay introduction of that? Thank you.", "Cheryl Blanchard", "I\u2019ll take both of those questions. Thanks, Joanne. First of all with respect to the communications with the FDA, we have shared our review and conclusions with the agency, and we will continue to update them. In terms of future interactions, it would be difficult for me to predict. They will be necessary and appropriate, certainly.", "In terms of our ongoing U.S. IDE study on the resurfacing system, in response to the actions that we are taking today with respect to the Durom Acetabular component, which is the acetabular component in that system, we are suspending enrollment until further notice.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets ", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray ", "I just had one clarification here. I just want to make sure I understood you and then I have a couple of questions if that\u2019s okay. The clarification was on this comment you made on SG&A. I think you talked about 175 basis points of increase due to legal and compliance expense. Is that right, Jim?", "James Crines", "That\u2019s right.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray ", "And in 175, that\u2019s growth or is that as a percentage of sales?", "James Crines", "Maybe I will make it easier for you, Matt. It\u2019s close to $20 million in expenses in the quarter.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray ", "That\u2019s the number I was coming up with and that sounded a little higher than I was thinking of in terms of a run rate. Is that about right?", "James Crines", "I think that\u2019s fair because I talk also about 50 to $60 million for the year. So clearly, the second quarter was the high water mark.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray ", "Okay. And then the other clarification item you talked about this first half growth and I didn\u2019t hear whether you had attributed some percentage growth number to the selling days and the Easter effect for the quarter?", "James Crines", "No, I think what you ought to do is look at the growth rate for the first six months because those billing day differences get neutralized between the two quarters.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray ", "Okay, so that 8% number or whatever you gave us was the normalized run rate first half?", "James Crines", "That\u2019s right.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray ", "Okay, there have been a lot of questions about this. But I just want to understand how we should think about it playing out over the next \u2013 granted this is going into next year, but I hope you can help us think about it. ", "It sounds like this rollout of the enhanced compliance program as you go into other divisions and layer in the same kind of rigor that you\u2019re putting into orthopedics; that is slowing things down. You have more training. Do you have an implementation timeline for that? I\u2019d love to hear when you think it will be done. ", "But is the right way to think about this at the end of that, assuming that you don\u2019t lose a lot of share, that you are going to be able to reaccelerate some of the growth in those businesses as that becomes part of more normal operations, or you get people trained up or get through this implementation process?", "David Dvorak", "Absolutely, Matt; we are very optimistic based upon the feedback that we\u2019ve received from surgeons that this is a transitional period. They\u2019re enthusiastic about the fact that we\u2019re back out and communicating with them in a very proactive way. ", "There are a lot of elements of this obviously and we\u2019re prioritizing our execution plans in accordance with the import of that business unit. There are aspects that first and foremost are essential on the communication front to get the training and education programs up and running across all these business units.", "With respect to U.S. Hips and Knees, obviously the payments are another area of prioritization for us and we\u2019re making good progress on that front. I think that you can see that most of the other competitors have slowed down their payments over the course of the 9-month term of these resolution agreements as well. ", "But I anticipate us making very significant progress in the third quarter and working with an eye towards marching into next year and certainly by the end of first quarter of next year to have all of that stuff behind us. ", "I would expect just in a macro sense to have the training and education events all up and running and that process to be very smoothed out before we exit this year. And that remaining U.S. Hip and Knee payment stuff may pend over until the first quarter of next year, but largely be resolved by the first quarter of next year as well.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray ", "Okay, and with respect to the other businesses and the global compliance, is it first or second quarter of next year that you feel like you get that behind you as well?", "David Dvorak", "I think no later than that, and I\u2019m more optimistic on that front, we\u2019ll probably have most of that behind us before this year is out.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray ", "I see. And then the other thing about this is as you mentioned what other companies are doing, I think I understand. You talked about what you\u2019re trying to do in terms of settling up with the surgeons that you have these royalty-based relationships with and then redrafting new agreements to go forward. ", "Are you concerned at all that that\u2019s cutting these folks loose to some degree as free agents at the end of the year once that agreement is signed, whereas if I look at other manufacturers, not to sound too mercenary here, but the folks with relationships with other manufacturers clearly have a reason to maintain and concentrate on that relationship because they do have these ongoing payments.", "David Dvorak", "Obviously, there is no nexus in our minds between the product choice that the surgeon makes and who we\u2019re engaging to provide services whether it\u2019s on the training and education side or providing intellectual property and input into the design of our products. ", "But our initiatives in that regard, Matt, are just to make sure that these existing contracts are treated in an appropriate way and that we\u2019re going back through and doing whatever work we need to, to make sure that the payments that go out are consistent with our current compliance program and our fair market value principles. ", "I don\u2019t want to describe that as a settle-up process. Our initiative in that regard is very rigorous and comprehensive. But the objective there is to make sure that everyone that we\u2019ve collaborated with is treated in a fair way and they are provided with full and fair value as supported by third-party valuations if necessary of those contracts. So that\u2019s the initiative that\u2019s underway in that context.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray ", "Okay. I think that\u2019s fair. The last question here was on some of the new products. The training it sounds like is part of the impact. Just to put this in perspective, we think about Natural Knee and Mobile Bearing, even when training gets going again, those are maybe a segment of your Knee business. ", "Is any of the sluggishness around some of these new products driven by concern over the cost of the technology or the complexity of the technology?  I\u2019m thinking of the Gender Hip with Kinectiv technology, is that something that you\u2019re confident is going to pick back up again? ", "Or, to your point earlier about making a connection between new products, the premium of the product, and the clinical outcomes, is that something that you feel like you have a strong case there, or has there been pushback on the price of that product?", "David Dvorak", "I think that it just is in the early stages, Matt. And so we\u2019ve seen enough disruption in the training efforts there to where we\u2019ve lost some time to be sure but we still believe in that technology and the receptivity that we\u2019ve received to what that technology represents and the patient benefits are still very positive. So we\u2019re optimistic about any of these launches that we have underway right now. We just think that we lost a bit of time.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray ", "Okay, that\u2019s fair. Thanks again for taking the questions.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from David Roman - Morgan Stanley.", "David Roman - Morgan Stanley ", "First of all, I wanted to spend a couple of seconds on the guidance. You went through all the details on the lowering of sales estimates. Given that in every case, you\u2019re saying that that is related to training and the implementation of your own compliance standards, what surprised you during the quarter compared to Q1 that caused such a dramatic change?", "David Dvorak", "I don\u2019t know that anyone anticipated the amount of work that was going to go into complying with the resolution agreements at the outset. It\u2019s difficult to forecast out because that\u2019s not a normal business cycle that we are going through or process that we are working through, and we probably lost some time on the front end that we didn\u2019t fully project out or appreciate going into, even the first quarter, let alone the second quarter, and so some of it was just that dynamic.", "David Roman - Morgan Stanley ", "So if you look at Mobile Bearing for example, and the number of physicians you\u2019ve been able to train compared to let\u2019s say a more rapid product launch, can you give us a sense as to how that compares six months out?", "David Dvorak", "I think that the difference is pretty dramatic is the way we\u2019d characterize it as opposed to what you would normally do at the point of launching those types of products or new technology along the lines of Kinectiv would fall into that same category. ", "But Kinectiv and Mobile Bearing Knees, a lot of training and education is necessary prior to a physician picking up that product and feeling comfortable with it. So any disruption in that regard is going to be seen directly in the commercialization side.", "David Roman - Morgan Stanley ", "Okay. And then on the margin front, gross margins are down, a little light relative to I think what people were looking for. Can you give us a sense as to where you think that will shake out for the full year?", "James Crines", "Maybe the best way to focus on that is to look at the change this quarter relative to second quarter prior year; a reduction of 190 basis points. About 160 basis points of that is related to the foreign currency hedge losses and the balance to both idle plant expense that we were experiencing at that Dover facility as well as inventory obsolescence charges. ", "I think if you look at where we landed for the quarter, slightly better is where we would expect to, when we consider that and the other charges had gone through there in the first quarter related to that OSP issue is where we would expect to be for the year.", "David Roman - Morgan Stanley ", "And are you dialing anything for higher raw material cost? Are you seeing anything on that front?", "James Crines", "We have. That\u2019s reflected and we had some visibility to that coming into the year and had that reflected in the guidance coming into the year. But to the extent we have seen further increases, we are now looking at what is roughly about 10 to $15 million of purchase price variances, some of which will get carried over into next year.", "David Roman - Morgan Stanley ", "Okay, and the last question, just to follow up on SG&A, you said that the 270 basis point year-over-year increase; 175 basis points related to compliance, what\u2019s the rest of that?", "James Crines", "The rest of that would be the step up we talked about coming into the year related to the operating and infrastructure initiatives. It\u2019s opportunity for U.S. distributor organizations to earn higher compensation on Trauma product lines; pushing out more instruments into the U.S. distributor organization; the cost associated with that. ", "They are in a better position to deal with the demands that are being made with surgery schedules getting pushed towards the front of the week. It\u2019s those other initiatives that are contributing to that increase.", "David Roman - Morgan Stanley ", "And you think that those efforts will be complete in 2008?", "James Crines", "They are, but as we have said before, those are things that carry over as well in to future periods to some degree.", "David Roman - Morgan Stanley ", "Got it. Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co.", "", "I believe you mentioned that Q2 R&D spend was lower than expected in part because of royalty renegotiations. And you guided us to expect R&D on the low end of the guidance range. Can you talk about how ongoing changes in your R&D practices may be affecting development timelines and how that compares to your assumptions coming into the year?", "Cheryl Blanchard", "First of all, just a point of clarification. There have not been any royalty renegotiations. It has really been a decrease in spend just related to straight fee-for-service consulting activity, so just a point of clarification on that note.", "In terms of how it has impacted development timelines, there certainly has been an impact. I think it\u2019s fairly well understood that during the initial phases of the monitor period that we were not holding development meetings. So there certainly will be some delays. ", "Overall, the projects that were in their later phases are continuing to move along and we are continuing to drive towards those timelines currently.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co.", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful; maybe a follow-up to the R&D question then. Is it fair to assume that the decision to suspend, retrain, and essentially re-launch Durom in the U.S. rather than to just discontinue the product might have been different if you had a follow-on metal-on-metal product planned for launch in the U.S. either in 2009 or 2010?", "David Dvorak", "Again, we believe in the technology and the clinical benefits of that product. The issue is not with respect to the product but rather to the surgical technique and the specificity of that technique and the training that accompanies it. So, that is the basis for the decision.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co.", "Okay, so maybe a more direct follow-up, could you give us any color on when you think you might have a follow-on metal-on- metal product in the U.S.?", "David Dvorak", "That obviously is a very important part of our pipeline and it will continue to be a priority and has been a priority, not just metal-on-metal, but the cup side of our Hip business in general going into 2009. We would anticipate making progress and working towards launching one or more cup products within that time period.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co.", "Okay, and one more question. You talked about the need to see other earnings reports from some of your competitors before arriving at any firm conclusions on market dynamics. But I think at this point, it\u2019s fair to conclude that recon volumes were decent at Biomet, DePuy, and Stryker during the quarter. ", "Given you said your moderation in the second half outlook goes really across your different businesses, can you help us understand why we shouldn\u2019t conclude that some of these enhanced compliance approaches that you are implementing either aren\u2019t going to drive you specifically to lose share if others aren\u2019t following the same approaches or that in general, if others are taking similar approaches, that volumes in general will pull back a little bit?", "David Dvorak", "We understand what\u2019s happening in the markets, Doug. In the context of Michael\u2019s question on the dental market, I think that we do have great visibility and a clear understanding of the core recon business and what has happened in the second quarter market-wise. ", "That was dental specific just to start off with, but I don\u2019t believe that this enhanced compliance model is going to negatively impact our future business. I think that it\u2019s the right thing to do. It\u2019s a longer term strategy. ", "I think that the likely impact is in the short term, but I think what you\u2019re going to see is continued scrutiny of these relationships, and we\u2019re making the decisions now that will allow us to continue to collaborate with surgeons in all the essential ways. ", "I think we are making the hard decisions out in front. For anyone who decides that they are going to be dragged through this transition process by an outside entity as opposed to internally driving a cultural change and a rigorous program in this context, what they are likely to see is future disruption to their ability to collaborate with surgeons. So that\u2019s what we are going to avoid with the process that we\u2019re going through now.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co.", "Great, thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse ", "I have a couple. In the quarter, it looks like from your cash flows, obviously you talked about selling a business and you also bought something. Can you give us any color since those are obviously closed deals on what those were?", "James Crines", "I am not going to give on the sale of the other assets specific detail. I think there is the fair amount of information out in the public domain that people are able to get a fair idea of what contributed to that gain in the quarter. Then with respect to the very small acquisition that we did in the quarter, that was an acquisition of our independent recon distributor based in Finland.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse ", "", "Okay, and I know this has been asked several times, but your other income including the gain on the sale of the assets, I am curious on your philosophy with adjusted net earnings since it looks like you are excluding all of the costs associated with acquisitions but now including gains for divestitures.

That gain, you can see it is in the interest in other income line. It\u2019s below operating profit, as it should be. And we\u2019ve been very clear about how much and any impact that it is having on earnings.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse ", "What did you say the guidance was for the full year on that line?", "James Crines", "25 to $30 million.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse ", "And that\u2019s all gains?", " ", "James Crines", "No, that\u2019s a net number, so that includes both interest expense on our borrowings as well as anticipated one-time gains.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse ", "Then just going back to your going into the field and looking at the experience with Durom. I know that this product has been used off-label in hip resurfacing. Are you seeing any higher incidents of revisions when it\u2019s used in that condition versus any use in a more traditional hip arthroplasty procedure, and what may be the implications for resurfacing?  ", "I know you said you\u2019re suspending enrollment, but how do you look at the going forward?  I think the last update you gave would be at best 2011. How do you feel positioned to compete against your competitors that will likely have a system, especially in light of some of your commentary last fall on how concerned you were with hip resurfacing?", "Cheryl Blanchard", "Let me take first of all your question on its potential use in off-label applications. I will tell you that in our very in-depth investigation where we reviewed individually 1,300 cases that we did not see one example of where the Durom Cup was used in any other instance other than a large diameter head application in a total hip arthroplasty. ", "I find myself not in a position to comment on its use in off-label application because I\u2019m not seeing it. I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s not out there. Certainly surgeons had the opportunity to direct their own use for the best care of their patients. But I will tell you that we have not seen it.", "In terms of your question related to the IDE study, because that cup is the acetabular component in that resurfacing study and because we\u2019ve taken the action that we have, we find it only appropriate to suspend enrollment on that study until further notice.", "Then in terms of our ability to compete in that product line going forward, I\u2019m going to turn that one over to Jim.", "James Crines", "You hit it, Kristen, for rightly pointing out that hip work clearly is going to be the focused on competing in the 90% to 92%, depending on where hip resurfacing levels out in the U.S. market, whether it\u2019s the 10%. ", "With everything else that we have in our portfolio including Trabecular Metal, which is unique and proprietary; the new products, the M/L Taper with Kinectiv technology; David referenced some work that we have underway in development to bring out what will be a new acetabular component system, there with the suspension, I would suspect, although this is something that still obviously has to be evaluated, there will be some delay beyond that 2011 period that we earlier referenced.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse ", "Okay, and Cheryl, just going back to your comments on reviewing, I think you said 1,300 patients?", "Cheryl Blanchard", "In the United States, yes.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse ", "Is that just 10% of all U.S. procedures and are you very comfortable that that\u2019s a good sample to project on what the total experience that they...", "Cheryl Blanchard", "Yes, that does represent about 10% of the cases that are currently available in the United States. The tack that we took was to go to among the highest volume sites in United States because there was a certain sense of urgency related to our ability to come to conclusion on the issues that were raised by our knowledge of loosenings and revisions that were occurring.

The answer is absolutely yes.", "Paul Blair", "Operator, in the interest of everyone\u2019s time, let\u2019s take two more questions.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from Robert Hopkins - Banc of America.", "Robert Hopkins - Banc of America ", "", "I have got just two questions. The first question is on the stability of the sales organization. Can you comment on the stability of the sales organization? And specifically, have you lost any distributors?

Thank you.", "David Dvorak", "We won\u2019t go into turnover but we\u2019ve had extraordinary stability among the U.S. distributor sales force. Furthermore, I think that our distributor group has really answered the call and addressed the challenges that we\u2019ve gone through in an admirable way. ", "They are clearly very on board with what we are doing as an organization. We think that we have the best distribution channel on the industry. Their reaction and how they conducted themselves through this period evidences that. So I have absolute confidence in our ability to execute with that group and we\u2019re proud to be affiliated with them.", "Robert Hopkins - Banc of America ", "So you haven\u2019t lost any?", "David Dvorak", "We have lost no distributors.", "Robert Hopkins - Banc of America ", "And you\u2019re basically comfortable saying that you\u2019ve got no abnormal level of turnover with the sales organization?", "David Dvorak", "That\u2019s right. The single exception to that has been we\u2019ve had some turnover on the Dental side within the U.S. But I have seen nothing abnormal at all outside of that.", "Robert Hopkins - Banc of America ", "Okay, and then the second question is, would you rule out M&A as an option to bolster your metal-on-metal offerings and by extension hip resurfacing?", "David Dvorak", "We would never rule out any external opportunities. Obviously we are constantly evaluating external opportunities and those are getting evaluated in the context of our internal development plans at all time. ", "So if there was technology that we thought was unique or that could accelerate, addressing any aspect of our offering that we thought was going to provide significant clinical benefits to patients, we would be interested in that.", "Robert Hopkins - Banc of America ", "Are those deals less likely now in giving the incremental expenses that you\u2019re incurring in 2008 and early part of 2009 or not necessarily?", "David Dvorak", "No, they are less likely.", "Robert Hopkins - Banc of America ", "Thank you for your time.", "Operator", "Your last question will be from Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird ", "Just a few clarifications here at the end. One, do you need any regulatory sign-off on the labeling changes for Durom? And if so, could that be the rate limiting step here as opposed to the training courses? ", "Number two, just a clarification on the P&L treatment of the royalty agreements that are in arrears at this point. Have you been running these presumed payments at all through the P&L or have they been left out of the P&L the last two quarters? ", "Then the third question/clarification, Jim, obviously some sensitivity around talking about the asset sales. But is it fair to assume the stock sales in the quarter that did add to the non-recurring gain would be the same sales going forward, and there would be no other type of non-strategic asset sales, they would just be similar ones we saw here in this quarter?", "Cheryl Blanchard", "I\u2019m happy to take your first question regarding regulatory sign-offs. There will certainly be appropriate communication with the FDA on that aspect of the sealed action. We will submit to them the labeling change, which is the regulatory action that\u2019s occurring as the result of this. ", "I do not believe that that will be a rate limiting step. I think that will happen in the normal course of our business. That will not be anything that would be causing us to slow down anything on the training and education side at all.", "James Crines", "The response to the question about royalty expense, we have continued to reflect that in the income statement, and we\u2019ve talked as well about the fact that it has contributed as well, to the extent that we are not making those payments, so it\u2019s getting reported in terms of free cash flow. And it\u2019s in the order of 20 to $25 million on a quarterly basis.", "And then finally on the asset sales, I\u2019m not going to answer that directly other than to say with whatever asset sales we undertake in the balance of the year, we\u2019ll do that in an organized and orderly fashion to ensure that we get good value for any assets that we sell.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird ", "Fair enough. Thanks.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

(ZMH) Q3 2008 Earnings Call October 23, 2008  8:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Paul Blair - VP of IR", "Dave Dvorak - President and CEO", "Jim Crines - Executive VP of Finance and CFO", "Analysts", "Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "Bruce Nudell - UBS", "Bob Hopkins - Banc of America", "Michael Jungling - Merrill Lynch", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "David Roman - Morgan Stanley", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital", "Paul Blair", "Good morning, I'm Paul Blair, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zimmer. I'd like to welcome you to the Zimmer third quarter 2008 Earnings Call. Joining me today to host this call are Dave Dvorak, President and Chief Executive Officer and Jim Crines, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning we'll review our performance for the third quarter, provide you with an update on certain key matters, present an update to our outlook for 2008 and conclude our discussion with a question-and-answer session.", "Before we get started, I would like to point out that this presentation contains forward-looking statements within the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, based on current expectations, estimates, forecast, and projections about the orthopedics industry, management management's beliefs, and assumptions made by management.", "These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.", "For a list and description of the risks and uncertainties, see the disclosure materials filed by Zimmer with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Zimmer disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.", "This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of such information to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, along with other financial and statistical information for the periods to be presented on this conference call was included in the press release announcing our earnings, which may be accessed from the Zimmer website at www.zimmer.com under the section entitled Investor Relations.", "A rebroadcast of this call will be available from approximately two hours following the conclusion of today's call through the end of the day on November 6, 2008 and can also be accessed from the Investor Relations section of the Zimmer website.", "At this time, I would like to introduce David Dvorak, President and Chief Executive Officer of Zimmer.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you, Paul, and good morning everyone. You probably had time to review at a high level our third quarter results and our news release. Now, we would like to provide you with some additional detail and context.", "Consolidated sales for the quarter of $952 million were up 5.4% over the prior year third quarter and 2.7% in constant currency. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.97, inclusive of a one-time gain of $18 million after tax, or $0.08 per share.", "Our sales results were lead by growth in knee revenues at 7% constant currency. Hip sales with the interruption of the Durom Cup sales increased 1% in constant currency during the third quarter. Our remaining business categories for the quarter on a constant currency basis, extremities was up 13% over the prior year period, trauma was up 7%, spine increased by 8% and dental was up 1%.", "Finally, our orthopedic surgical products business was down 19% for the quarter due to the previously announced voluntary suspension of production of certain products in our in Dover, Ohio facility.", "Some strengthening in the US dollar lead to lower than anticipated currency translation benefits in the third quarter. As we've discussed before, the top line impact of currency fluctuation is essentially neutralized on the bottom line due to our hedging program.", "During the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $308 million. Jim will provide more specific details of our financial results and other finance activities in a few minutes. Reflecting on our performance for the third quarter, we delivered bottom line results that exceeded Wall Street expectations, albeit with a one-time gain that offset certain of the one-time costs that are adversely impacting our performance this year.", "While our earnings came in above expectations, our sales results were disappointing relative to the estimated market growth. Over the past year, we set in motion a number of initiatives designed to prepare us for greater success in the future. Our infrastructure and operating initiatives continue to progress well, and we believe these will make us more efficient and effective.", "However, a few factors are adversely impacting our sales results, and likely will continue to impact our performance through the first half of 2009. Let me describe some of the primary factors that are negatively affecting our current performance as well as the aggressive actions that we're taking to improve our future performance.", "First, after we entered in to the resolution agreements with the Department of Justice and Office of Inspector General last year, we took steps to enhance our compliance model. We chose to implement broad changes now rather than incrementalize the efforts. We believe that it's essential that we continue to collaborate with surgeons and other healthcare professionals and everything we have done from a compliance standpoint is for the purpose of preserving our ability to collaborate in the future.", "For instance, no matter how talented our workforce, we simply cannot design and development first rate products to address unmet clinical needs without partnering closely with surgeons and other healthcare professionals. Similarly, in order to meet our obligation to ensure that surgeons are properly trained on the safe and effective use of our products, it's essentially that we solicit the help of surgeon collaborators who are highly skilled and experienced in performing the complex procedures.", "As we previously disclosed, the transition over the past year has been disruptive to our relationships with consultants. For instance, we were unable to communicate when development meetings would resume, when educational courses would occur and when suspended consulting payments would be made.", "In other words, we weren't able to provide visibility as to how and when these matters would be resolved, and quite understandably that was frustrating to our consultants. We've been extremely focused on taking steps that we believe will restore these important relationships. We have conducted development meetings for a number of projects, resumed our Zimmer institute educational course, begun making overdue consulting payments and made substantial headway on resolving our past due royalty obligation.", "Importantly, we have finalized the new royalty payment structure that will be employed for the future development projects. We continue to believe that royalty payments are the most logical and fair manner, which to compensate healthcare professionals for their valuable intellectual property contributions.", "Over the past six months, I have met in person with more than 150 of our consultants all around the world in order to explain what Zimmer is doing and why. Based upon these discussions we're confident that our direction is the right one to assure that we have the ability to capture the best of the collaborations between surgeons and industry, those that provide real solutions to unmet clinical needs while inspiring trust and confidence.", "We regret the turmoil created by these circumstances, but we're proud of the efforts our people have made to abide by the resolution agreements and our enhanced compliance programs.", "I also want to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to our surgeon consultants for their contribution and commitment. While this transition has been very disruptive, the vast majority of surgeons have exhibited extraordinary patients and expressed a continued interest in collaborating with Zimmer going forward. These individuals put the patient's interest first and they share our belief to conducting business in a compliant and ethical manner is consistent with those interests.", "The second set of actions I want to discuss are related to the Durom Cup. I want to thank the team of Zimmer employees and very importantly the products developers and other surgeon collaborators who created a comprehensive training program that enabled us to resume marketing of the product in August within one month of the announcement of a voluntary suspension in the United States.", "To date, more than 230 surgeons have completed the requisite training. As an aside, I want to know that the Durom Cup situation led us to further develop and refine our thinking regarding delivery of surgeon training on the safe and effective use of Zimmer products.", "In our April 17th press release announcing key enhancements that we're making to our compliance model, we indicated that we'll [cease] be using physicians to train and educate on products for which they may receive royalty-based compensation connected with the company's sale of the products, however, the Durom experience led us to conclude that there are instances in which it is necessary and [advisable] to use the product designers to train other surgeons on the safe and effective use.", "At Zimmer, we're now managing these potential conflicts of interest through other important enhancements we've made to our compliance program. While the Durom matter presented one situation where we needed to use royalty-bearing surgeons to facilitate effective training, there will be other instances where we will continue this practice based on our training needs.", "The third set of actions, I want to highlight involved our OSP business, where we're upgrading quality systems to enable us to fully return the affected OSP products to market. The remediation efforts are continuing and we now expect to have a significant portion of the suspended OSP products back in production by the end of this year with the balance of the affected products back in production by the end of the first quarter of next year.", "Forth, our other infrastructure and operating investments continue on track. Our new plant in Shannon, Ireland will be ready to commence operations toward the end of this year. We're making significant expansions in our Winterthur, Switzerland operations. We're installing a new state-of-the-art foundry in Warsaw, and very importantly we're continuing the expansion and strengthening of our corporate-wide quality systems.", "Finally, as one contemplates our business prospects within the core reconstructive market, it's important to note that our knee franchise remains among the strongest and most comprehensive portfolios of clinical solutions in the industry. That offering begins with our new patella femoral joint for partial knee replacement for patients with early stage of the arthritis, and advances through our primary knee systems to our new segmental system fo complex revision arthroplasty for those patients with significant bone loss.", "Our knee systems, including NexGen, Natural and Innex, offer multiple options for [a field of] various and discriminating preferences. Our NexGen system with approximately 2 million implantations globally, since its introduction is reported to have the lowest rate of revision among many knee systems, followed within the certain national registries.", "On the hip side, we already possess an extremely comprehensive line of stems with track records of outstanding clinical performance. We have recently added the bone conserving -- connective system and M/L Taper with connective system. We're working diligently to complete development and introduce new technologically advanced Acetabular systems during the second half of 2009.", "Although these systems will not address our hip resurfacing gap in the market, our product position in the US should be significantly enhanced.", "I'll conclude by briefly commenting on our near-term prospects. While we have made substantial progress on many important initiatives in 2008, and have responded to additional challenges along the way, the factors I have described collectively led to the loss of some customers across our geographic sales channels in the third quarter.", "We believe the knee and hip market on a global basis continues to grow at mid-single digits and units, and when combined with mix-benefit opportunities in high single digits on a dollar basis, our knee and hip results lag show market growth in the quarter. As a result, we have adjusted our full year 2008 sales guidance as outlined in our press release, and as Jim will discuss in more detail.", "We also anticipate that the factors I have discussed will create headwinds for us going into 2009 and that our overall revenues are likely to grow below market at low to mid-single-digits in the first half of 2009. We expect improvement in the second half of 2009, as we launch new products, and as the disruptive events of 2008 anniversary out of our results.", "We're working through the 2009 planning process, and intend to provide 2009 earnings guidance on our fourth quarter investor call, but on a preliminary basis, given the headwinds we face on our top-line and the dilution associated with the Abbott Spine transaction, we're now anticipating more modest leverage in earnings, most likely resulting in high single-digit growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share for 2009.", "Jim will now provide further details on the quarter and our guidance. Jim?", "Jim Crines", "Thanks, David. I will review our performance in the quarter in more detail and then provide some additional information related to our guidance. Sales of $952 million for the quarter represent an increase of 5.4% reported, and 2.7% constant currency. These results include the effect of one extra billing day in the US in the quarter and reflect lower than anticipated benefit from foreign currency as well as lower reconstructive sales relative to expectations.", "The US dollar strengthened as compare to many foreign currencies during the quarter and while the impact was lower than [leasing] quarters, foreign currency still increased revenue by 2.7% or $25 million in the quarter.", "Consolidated pricing was down, 1.5 of a percentage point for the quarter, in both, the Americas and Europe price was flat for the quarter, while Asia Pacific results include negative price of 3.9% driven by negative 4.8% in Japan and negative 4.7% in Australia, with changes to certain implant prices took effect as of the beginning of the quarter.", "Turning to our revenue growth by major product category, worldwide reconstructive sales 7.3% reported, 4.4% constant currency. Knee sales in the third quarter improved 6.9% constant currency, reflecting slower unit growth in certain segments combined with slightly lower net pricing on a global basis. Knee pricing on a global basis was down 1.2 percentage points in the quarter compared with negative 0.6% in the second quarter, principally as a result of the lower prices now in effect in Australia.", "Flex Knees accounted for 54% of our knee unit sales on a global basis in the third quarter, showing modest but continuing increases in levels of penetration relative to prior quarters. Against the backdrop of the disruptive factors that David described, our geographic operating segments reported certain customer losses in the quarter which in the aggregate reduce our base of global knee revenues by approximately 3%.", "Countering the effect of those losses, our Natural-Knee sales increased over 40% in the quarter on a dollar basis following a recent introduction of the Gender Solutions femoral components for that system. With the launch of our new Segmental Knee, sales of Hinge Knees increased over 15% on a small base. With the introduction of the Mobile Bearing Knee in the US, our LPS- Mobile Bearing Knee units increased over 25% on a global basis.", "In the third quarter, knee sales in constant currency increased 6.8% in the Americas, 9.3% in Europe, and 3.6% in Asia Pacific, respectively. The Asia Pacific results reflect a 5.9% reduction in average selling prices. Hip sales increased just under 1% in the quarter reflecting interruption in Durom Cup sales as well, and some customer losses which similar to knees, lower our global base of Hip revenue by approximately 3%.", "While we are working through final stages of development on projects that will strengthen our Acetabular Cup portfolio, we have significantly enhanced our Stem offerings this year with the launch of the M/L Taper with connective technology, our (inaudible 12th 0:24) Stem for the European market, and the recently released Fitmore bone conserving stem. The M/L Taper, (inaudible) and the Fitmore, all experienced solid growth in the quarter offset in part by lower sales by VerSys Fiber Metal MidCoat, Beaded 6-inch FullCoat, and other cemented stems.", "On a geographic basis and in constant currency, hip sales increased 2.4% in the Americas, 0.7% in Europe, and decreased 3% in Asia Pacific, which includes negative pricing of 4.6%. Extremity sales for the quarter in constant currency increased 13.4% on a challenging comp with 33% in the third quarter of 2007. Extremity sales increased 19.3% in the Americas, 3.6% in Europe, and decreased 15.1% in Asia Pacific on a small base.", "Dental sales on a constant currency basis were flat for the quarter, on a challenging prior year comp with 17%. Dental sales decreased 1.8% in the Americas. As indicated in our second quarter call, compliance related disruption, as well as economic conditions were expected to have a negative impact on dental revenues through the second half of this year.", "The results in dental are inline with what we had expected for the quarter. In addition, we recently have worked through many of the issues in applying [art hands] compliance model to our dental business, and activities are back, up, and running. We remain committed to our strategy to seek to expand our presence in the dental market as we believe the commercial opportunities remain very attractive longer term. Dental sales increased 3.7% and 4.4% in Europe and Asia Pacific respectively.", "Trauma sales in the quarter were up over the prior year periods 6.6% constant currency, our plate and screw lines, as well as bone graft substitutes continue to lead our growth in trauma. We look forward to the 2009 release of an upgraded Nile line in order to fill a current gap in our growth potential. On a constant currency basis trauma sales in the quarter increased 3.3% in the Americas, increased 5.3% in Asia Pacific, and increased a very strong 18.1% in Europe.", "Zimmer Spine reported 7.6% constant currency growth in the quarter. With the consummation of the Abbott Spine acquisition, we look forward to realizing the full market potential of a combined Abbott Spine and Zimmer Spine business. Spine sales in the Americas were up 2.2%, Europe increased 19.1%, and Asia Pacific was up over 100% on a small base.", "Finally, orthopedic surgical products and other sales declined 18.6% constant currency in the quarter, as a result of the voluntary suspension in sales of certain patient care products, partially offset by bone, cement, and accessory sales, which grew over prior year.", "The OSP and other category was down 16.6% in the Americas, declined 34.7% in Europe, and was down 12.9% in Asia Pacific compared with the prior year period. We are encouraged that remediation efforts at our Dover facility are progressing. And as we move in to 2009, we look forward to stocking shelves and putting the OSP products back in the sales bag.", "Now I'll focus on the rest of the income statement. Our adjusted gross profit margin of 75.2% for the quarter is down 270 basis points from the prior year third quarter. Foreign currency hedge losses accounted for the majority of the decline in gross margin with idle plant cost, inventory, and excess and obsolete inventory charges making up the balance.", "Compared to last year, R&D expense decreased 11.9% to $47 million for the quarter as a result of lower spending on consulting services, and delays in new product development activities. At 4.9% of sales, R&D spending is just below our targeted and historical range of 5% to 6%. Collaborative development activities are expected to ramp back up and we anticipate spending will return to that stated 5% to 6% range in the near term.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $405 million, up 14.8% over prior year, and include monitor fees, as well as consulting and legal fees associated with the global implementation of the enhanced compliance model as we discussed during last quarter's call.", "Also included in SG&A for the quarter is a favorable adjustment to reduce performance-based share compensation accruals by approximately $7 million. At 42.5% of sales, SG&A expenses are 350 basis points above prior year, inclusive of the significant one-time fees and expenses associated with compliance.", "Acquisition, integration, and other amounted to $5.6 million in the quarter, comprised of cost pertaining to current and prior period acquisitions, including facility consolidation costs, legal fees and retention and termination payments.", "On July 22nd, we announced the voluntary, temporary suspension of marketing and distribution of the Durom Acetabular Component in the US. That announcement filed the reports of cup losing instant revision of the Acetabular component used in Total Hip Arthroplasty. During the third quarter, the company recorded a provision of $47.5 million for known and anticipated claims related to the Durom Cup.", "Our estimate for these claims is limited to revisions associated with surgeries that predate our voluntary suspension, and which also occur within two years of the original surgery date. This is consistent with our data which indicates that cup loosenings associated with technique are most likely to occur within that timeframe.", "This provision is classified as a non-recurring item and is therefore excluded from our non-GAAP earnings measure. Alternatively, any claims received outside of the defined parameters will be managed in the normal course and reflected in our standard quarterly product liability accruals.", "Adjusted operating profit in the quarter decreased 11.2% to $264.8 million, at 27.8% our adjusted operating to sales ratio decreased by 520 basis points from prior year as a result of the lower gross margin and the significant and temporary step-up in SG&A costs.", "Interest, and other income for the quarter amounted to $28.2 million, including a one-time pre-tax gain of $29.8 million on the sale of 5.2 million shares of RTI Biologics, which shares the company had originally obtained for the acquisition of Centerpulse.", "Adjusted net earnings increased 1.4% compared to prior year at $218.5 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 6.6% to $0.97 on $225.6 million average outstanding diluted shares. These adjusted earnings per share are inclusive of approximately $0.04 of share-based compensation. A $0.95, reported diluted earnings per share increased over 400% on prior-year third quarter reported EPS of $0.19, which included a $169.5 million settlement charge.", "Our reported earnings for the third quarter include the provision for certain claims, as well as one-time tax benefit associated with the DOJ civil settlement paid in 2007. This previously disclosed in our periodic filings, no tax benefit was recorded related to the settlement expense due to uncertainties to the tax treatment. We submitted a pre-filing agreement to the IRS in order to make a final determination of the deductibility of the settlement payment. As a result of reaching agreement with the tax authority during the third quarter we have recorded an estimated current tax benefit of $31 million. Consistent with the treatment of the 2007 settlement charge, this tax benefit is classified as a nonrecurring item, and is therefore excluded from our non-GAAP earnings measure.", "A 25.3% adjusted for the quarter, our effective tax rate reflects a favorable year-to-date adjustment to bring the effective tax-rate for the nine month period ended September 30 to 27.2%. This is below our first half estimates and 30 basis points below our full-year 2007 ETR due to favorable geographic mix of earnings and profits.", "During the quarter, we repurchased 720,000 shares at a total purchase price of $48.6 million, at an average price per share of $67.50. We used cash to acquire the shares under a $1.25 billion repurchase authorization which expires at the end of 2009. Our decision to pursue and ultimately acquire Abbott Spine business for $360 million resulted in our share repurchases in the quarter doing well within the first two quarters of the year. Approximately $1.18 billion remains under this program, the company had approximately 225 million shares of common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2008, down from 226 million as of June 30, 2008.", "Turning to cash flow, operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $308 million, up from $167 million in the third quarter of 2007, which included the civil settlement with the US Department of Justice. Inventory days on hand, finished the quarter at 321 days, a decrease of 9 days from prior year third quarter reflecting higher cost of goods in the quarter. Our trade accounts receivable days sales outstanding finished the quarter at 59 days an increase of one day over the prior year third quarter.", "Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter amounted to $67.4 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $135 million, including $67 million for instruments and $68 million for property plant and equipment, which includes $25 million related to infrastructure initiatives. Finally, free cash flow was $173 million for the quarter.", "Now I'll turn to our update on guidance for 2008. Our press release this morning stated that we have adjusted our top-line sales growth and adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance for the full-year 2008. For 2008, we expect to deliver top-line sales growth of 7% to 7.5% compared to the previous guidance range of 8.5% to 9% and adjusted diluted earnings per share including $0.02 of dilution related to the Abbott Spine acquisition of $4.03 to $4.08. The adjustment to our sales guidance now includes an estimated $20 million of revenue from Abbott Spine and anticipates approximately 3.3 points of growth to come from foreign currency versus the previous 4 points.", "Our revised sales guidance now assumes a constant currency growth rate of 3.7% to 4.2% as compared to previous constant currency growth of 4.5% to 5%. Adjusted estimates also exclude one-time charges related to the Abbott Spine purchase price allocation for acquired inventory restructuring and integration charges, as well as an in-process research and development charge anticipated in connection with the transaction. The definitive purchase price allocation will be completed during the fourth quarter.", "To arrive at our projected GAAP earnings per share for the full-year, you should assume subtracting an estimated in-process research and development charge of $50 million, the certain claims provision of $47.5 million, the tax benefit on the 2007 civil settlement of $31 million, amortization of step-ups in inventory value of $8 million, and acquisition, integration and other expenses of approximately $37 million, for an estimated total of $0.37 per share. As always, our guidance and assumptions exclude the effect of potential future acquisitions or other unforeseen material business events for litigation matters.", "Turning to cash flow, we anticipate capital expenditures to be around $500 million for the full-year, reflecting the capital components of many of our 2008 infrastructure and operating initiatives. Also for some time now we've discussed that we will use our free cash flow to fund strategic acquisitions and/or share repurchases. Earlier in the year we also explained our intentions to draw up to $500 million on our credit facility to fund share repurchases under approved repurchase programs. Year to date, we have used $469 million in available cash and have borrowed $220 million to fund the repurchase of 9.5 million shares. ", "David, I'll turn the call back over to you.", "Dave Dvorak", "Well, thank you, Jim. We've recently completed our strategic plan and such an exercise provides for the opportunity to review and appreciate the potential our industry promises. As we move beyond the issues of defining surgeon collaboration and the format of ongoing surgeon relationships, we're now able to focus our attention on working with surgeon collaborators to develop the best products for patients. We're excited about the underlying fundamentals of our business, and what is on the horizon for us in the area of new products and technologies.", "We're in an enviable position as a $4 billion global corporation generating over $500 million of free cash flow annually. Even in a year when we're making significant investments, overcoming extraordinary events, and implementing a more sustainable business model, we believe Zimmer's business is on track for a bright future.", "Finally, we're delighted to welcome Abbott Spine into the Zimmer family of businesses. Abbott Spine will allow us to continue to build toward critical mass in the spine market. We're gaining access to new products and talented employees and are increasing our sales coverage as a result of this combination. We announced last week that we have closed the transaction and teams from both organizations are working very diligently to assure that we can equip the expanded Zimmer Spine organization to serve our collective customers.", "As we entered 2008, we indicated this would be a year of transition and investment for us. The Abbott Spine acquisition is an example of our continued financial strength and willingness to invest for future growth.", "And now, I would like to open the call to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy of Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Good morning.", "Dave Dvorak", "Good morning.", "James Crines", "Good morning.", "Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "I was wondering if I could just ask a little about the surgeon relationships you spent some time talking about. I think this is probably the first time you've actually mentioned that, you've seen some dislocation because of your compliance activities.", "I'm curious, what gives you confidence that those relationships will come back? In a sense, that these surgeons will, I guess you have mentioned that you have lost some customers; that these will return at some point?", "Dave Dvorak", "", "The customer losses are a combination of the factors that I mentioned, not only the enhanced compliance program implementation, but obviously the disruption that was created by the Durom Cup matter and some of the other things we faced including OSP. So when I speak about our surgeon collaborators, I'm quite confident after having over 150 conversations with these individuals that they understand what we're trying to accomplish with this enhanced compliance program, they frankly see the proof points developing all around them that these relationships have got to be managed in a very careful way.", "As we explained the vigorous nature of our program, they subscribed to that model and expressed a continued interest to work with us, so I'm quite confident we're going to have the ability to attract the talent that we need to develop great products and to train and educate in a first-rate fashion..", "Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "But having said all that though I think, if I heard correctly you mentioned the hip and knee business were both impacted by about 3%, because of lost customers. Did I miss understand that?", "Dave Dvorak", "", "No, that's correct. I mean, on the customer side of those relationships it's also true that the disruptions that we faced this year have caused some displacement of their customer base and I can't give you an absolute assurance that that business is going to come back our way. That could be the cost of implementing the program and going through the transitions that we have this year.", "What I can tell you is that we're taking the steps to make sure that we retain the existing customer base going forward, and we're quite confident that as we enter in to the second half of 2009, we're going to be able to put ourselves on a nice growth track.", "Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. And just one last one on the Durom training, I think you mentioned that there was, looking back at my notes, 230 surgeons had been retrained on that product. What percentage of the users does that represent?", "Dave Dvorak", "Well, it's probably about a quarter of the exhaustive list of users, but I would tell you it's greater than 50% of the active users at the point of the pullback of that product.", "Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. Thank you.", "Dave Dvorak", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tao Levy of Deutsche Bank.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning.", "Dave Dvorak", "Good morning.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank", "My question, maybe it's a clarification. You did mention 2009 revenue guidance, I think in the low single-digits, sort of as a ballpark, does that include the headwind from currency, or is that include constant currency?", "Jim Crines", "Just to talk for a minute about currency, assumptions that we have, the forecast that we have for the fourth quarter and then as we look at 2009, and we will give more specific guidance on 2009 on our fourth quarter call.", "There is always a little bit of a lag on the development of these forecasts, so the rates that we have used in the development of the guidance we have provided for the fourth quarter were the rates in effect coming out of the quarter, and those are the same rates that were used to develop the sort of general guidance that David described for 2009.", "So to the extent if you look at where rates have traded over the last couple of weeks, to the extent that the dollar continues to strengthen, there could very well be some further adjustment to the currency assumptions as we complete the 2009 plan and ultimately provide more specific guidance on that fourth quarter call.", "And I would keep in mind, Tao, that that currency effect on the top line has minimal effect on the bottom line as we look out over the next 12 months, because of our hedging program.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Essentially it was a reported number that you were talking about, not necessarily constant currency?", "Jim Crines", "No. 2009 number that we're talking about is the right way to think about that as is a constant currency number.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then just turning back to the customers and sort of the transition it seems like based on your tone, second quarter, it doesn't seem maybe there was that much disruption and then here in the third quarter it seems like things have progressively worsen.", "And now as you talk about the fourth quarter and 2009, at least the first half of 2009, that you've gotten some pretty strong indications that the customers are frustrated. It's going to take some time to come back.", "Did anything happen specifically between the third quarter and what you are seeing now to kind of make you a little bit more concerned about those relationships?", "Jim Crines", "Well, the passage of time, I think that we're taking a lot of steps to catch up on payments, to get our design meetings back up and running to fully ramp up training and education, so with every passing month, I think that their frustration grows, the reason that we are confident that this is going to turn for us is our activities are really coming together in those areas, so, I just think that we started to see some customer displacement in the third quarter, and that's not going to go away in the fourth quarter", "But as we take the corrective actions, we see that remedying itself as we are progressing at 2009, so there is just going to be a lag in the activities that we're taking to take care of these subject matters, and then the performance of the business. Also to follow-up on the comment, someone mentioned that the low single-digit to mid single-digit, we do see that top line growth rate on a constant currency basis accelerating in the second half of 2009 as a consequence of all of these actions.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Jim Crines", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic of Piper Jaffray.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "Hi, good morning. Can you hear me okay?", "Dave Dvorak", "Good morning, Matt. We can.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "Thanks for taking the questions. I had one just clarification on Durom. You mentioned 230 surgeons having taken the training course. Any sense of how that compares to the total number of surgeons who are using the Cup prior to the hold that you put on the product last quarter?", "Dave Dvorak", "Yeah, Matt, I think it's in excess of half of the active users as of the point of us pulling the product back or the capability to use that product back earlier in the year.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. And just looking forward, we hear about another cup that you have coming, potentially something that could be used for metal-on-metal as well. Are you seeing that, as you get in to next year, that you may in fact be transitioning some of these folks to a next-generation product.", "Dave Dvorak", "Okay.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. And more about that at [AOS] maybe?", "Dave Dvorak", "Maybe so.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "All right. The question on this gross margin, maybe my numbers were just off here in the quarter, but it looked like I would have expected the less FX impact, maybe a little benefit to gross margins since those things kind of move in opposite directions. Was there anything else in the quarter that may have hung on the gross margin a little bit more than you would have expected?", "Jim Crines", "Well, the couple of things that I mentioned, Matt, one is still some of the plant costs with the Dover facility, and as well as some inventory charges, which, you know, on the base of revenues in the third quarter tend to be a bit higher as a percentage of sales and have more of an pact, I guess on the margin in the third quarter.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. Okay. That's helpful, and then just one more here, and I will get out of the way, just on the economic backdrop, everyone keeps asking, it seems the same question over and over again, but have you seen anything on the private payer side, anything that would suggest that patients are opting to defer procedures, or is that part of your business? You still look pretty solid. And then on a capital side, I don't think there's much exposure that you have, but if you could call out any thing that you might think could be affected if capital budgets come under scrutiny at the end of this year and into next year?", "Dave Dvorak", "", "We hear some pick-up on the initial part of your question, Matt, we hear some rumblings but they are very anecdotal as far as the general economic trends having an impact on the business. To date we haven't really seen a measurable impact. And frankly don't anticipate in the core reconstructive business, of course the dental business sees that kind of an impact because of the payer model. Jim, do you have anything to add to that?", "Jim Crines", "", "No, we've got a lot of questions about this, Matt, as you know, and we're paying careful attention to unit volumes across all of our accounts both on the Medicare side and the private pay side. At least at this stage, we're not really having any effect and I have seen reports that argue on the one hand that the economy may cause a bit of a slowdown on the private pay side. On the other hand, I have seen reports that would argue just the opposite where people in some situations displaced and taking advantage over that period of time while they have things like corporate benefits to get there, their hip and knees done and get through the rehab before they get back into the work force. I think the key is, that at this point at least, we're not seeing it.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. Great. Thanks very much.", "Jim Crines", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell of UBS.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS", "Good morning. Thanks for the question, and pardon my voice. In '07 you guys had about 23% unit share in hips, about 30% in knees. Are you saying that you basically lost three points of unit share? And I guess my question also with regards to losing those high-volume surgeons who were your consultants. They are still active. They have obviously continued putting in hips and knees, which means they are using other people's products, and perhaps, picked up consultancies from other firms, so why should they come back? I have a follow-up.", "Jim Crines", "Yeah, it's three points of our base. So it's not three points off of the total market, Bruce. And I would tell you that the guidance with respect to the full year 2008, does not assume that they would come back, nor does the guidance with respect to 2009 assume that those that we have lost would come back. As David indicated, we would see our performance improving in the back half of next year as we anniversary out of these losses, and as we enter into a period where we're going to be introducing some new products, one of which was touched on earlier on the hip side.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS", "Okay, but does that mean that most of this loss is on unit side as opposed to the mix side?", "Jim Crines", "Yes.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS", "Okay. And could you explain what happened in ex-US hips? On the last call, you guys basically pointed us to and frankly our field check suggested that Durom was a US problem, but clearly ex-US hips for the companies that have reported to far, your constant currency was around 8%. And so what happened there?", "Jim Crines", "Well we had a significant adjustment effect I guess if you look at the pricing in Asia Pacific in particular, that had a significant impact on performance with respect to the Asia Pacific results. In Europe, clearly kind of a step-down in what we were experiencing in the first half of the year, and in large part due to the losses that we described. These losses do cut across all geographic segments. And with the regard to Durom Cup, our sales outside of the US did grow in the quarter. They did grow at a somewhat slower rate than we saw in the first half of the year, but we did have growth in Durom Cup sales outside the US in the third quarter.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins of Banc of America.", "Bob Hopkins - Banc of America", "Hi, good morning, and thank you for taking the call. I just wanted to get some clarification on the '09 thoughts. You have given '08 guidance of 403 to 408, is the high double-digit earnings growth in '09 estimate of that 403 to 408?", "Jim Crines", "High single-digits, you mean, Bob, right?", "Bob Hopkins - Banc of America", "Yes, sorry, high single-digits.", "Jim Crines", "That is correct. It is off that base.", "Bob Hopkins - Banc of America", "Okay. And does that also include $0.10 of dilution from Abbott?", "Jim Crines", "Yes.", "Bob Hopkins - Banc of America", "Okay. And then lastly on the '09 guidance, just in terms of how you'd characterize it? Is this sort of your best estimate at this point, as you look at all the puts and takes, or given what has gone on over the last six to 12 months, should we assume that there is a fair amount of cushion built into this just given all the changes as you have been through.", "Dave Dvorak", "We are just giving you the best viewpoint we can at this stage, Bob and obviously we are going to come back with a much more refined view and specificity when we give you the detailed guidance in the fourth quarter call, but this is the way we see it at this stage.", "Bob Hopkins - Banc of America", "Okay. And then just following up on your comments about disruptions from the consultant base and losing some physician customers. Could you just provide a little bit more granularity there in terms of, is it just doctors moving around to competitors, or is there an aspect to this that involves your sales force? And I have asked this question on the last couple of calls. I'm just curious if you could give us a sense of the turnover in your sales force during the third quarter.", "Dave Dvorak", "And nothing material has changed from the responses that we gave in the last quarterly call on that point. We are seeing stability, nothing unusual going on with the sales force. These customer relationships have moved due to reasons that are unrelated generally to, both the sales force as well as the products subject to those gaps that we've been very open in discussing.", "Bob Hopkins - Banc of America", "Okay. And then just lastly, real quickly, can you give us your latest updated thoughts on the outlook for pricing in the United States?", "Jim Crines", "", "We saw a little bit of a step down this past quarter. But as we look forward, Bob, we don't really see that environment changing from the way we've talked about it in the past. It's both, in the US flat to slightly up.", "As we look to pass along increases in list prices, we look to pass along the increases that are embedded in a lot of the multiyear arrangements that we have with hospitals that are tied to some index of inflation.", "I know you didn't ask about internationally, but with respect to the international markets weave going in to 2009, anniversary out of an adjustment and reimbursement prices in Japan don't expect there to be another one next year. And then would expect to some pressure in Europe in the same markets where we have been experiencing some pressure and have experienced some low single-digit adjustments downward in prices.", "Bob Hopkins - Banc of America", "And that's on a worldwide basis going forward just flat to slightly down, is that?", "Jim Crines", "I think that's a fair way to think about it, yes.", "Bob Hopkins - Banc of America", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Dave Dvorak", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Jungling of Merrill Lynch.", "Michael Jungling - Merrill Lynch", "Great, thank you.. I've got a couple of questions. The first one is for Dave. You try and set up Zimmer for best practice with respect to compliance, but I'm just wondering whether pendulum has swung too far the other way, because everyday you also I guess have to balance shareholder interest, and if you keep on losing market share that may not be the right balance. But the first question is why do you think you have the right balance when you lose about 2 to 3 points of top line growth in hips and knees?", "Dave Dvorak", "We are making these decisions, Michael, consistent with the shareholders interest. We believe that we're in the initial stages of what's going to be a fundamental change in the industry, and how these relationships are structured and managed.", "As we've said repeatedly, we're not going to incrementalize this change process within our business. We're doing that because we want to make sure that we get access to absolutely the best design surgeons, the best trainers and educator, etcetera, and so we're going to take the bold steps that need to be taken now to preserve our ability to get that input.", "We think that if one were to pursue this in a manner where they were to incrementalize those efforts they are going to go through continued disruption over the course of a long period of time. As enforcement actions continue to play out, as legislators continue to promulgate further enforcement of these ethical principals and try to police these relationships in a more aggressive manner, so it's early in this change process.", "We think that we have got the right approach. It never was an approach that by definition was going to prove out in the short-term to be beneficial, but it's completely consistent with the shareholders longer-term interest, and I think that you are going to see that in the coming periods.", "So, again, all of these decisions are driven to ensuring that we have the ability to continue to innovate and to provide solutions that address unmet clinical needs and train and educate in the best manner possible, and so these decisions are going to get made with patient's interests in mind and it will go down on the shareholders' benefit.", "Michael Jungling - Merrill Lynch", "At what point in time would you recognize perhaps that maybe we lose too much market share and we need to change things? How long would that be away before maybe we've been too aggressive?", "Dave Dvorak", "No, we're on the right track, Michael.", "Michael Jungling - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. The second question is on the Spine acquisition, I'm just curious what the rationale was? If you look at the sales in the EBIT, it seems Abbott Spine was highly profitable, $40 million of restructuring charges will probably mean a payback period of ten years. Can you give us an indication why Abbott Spine was so important to you?", "Dave Dvorak", "For all of the reasons we have articulated. We pick up a great base of products with a nice pipeline. That was not a business that on a standalone basis was highly profitable. It was marginally profitable. But again, that business allows us to establish critical mass on a lot of important fronts that will enable us to participate in a meaningful way in that growing market.", "Michael Jungling - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Final question is on the SG&A and maybe this is a question for Jim. I think the point that was made was that the SG&A costs have increased temporarily, and I'm just curious, what you mean by temporarily, will that decrease in 2009, or temporary mean maybe 2010?", "Dave Dvorak", "Yeah. Certainly, we're going to have the opportunities we have talked about going into 2009 to save the one-time fees, third-party fees and expenses that we have incurred in 2008 with respect to the implementation of the compliance initiative across all our business units and around the globe. Some of that may very well get reinvested in other areas. But again, we are going to have the opportunity to save those third-party fees and expenses going in to 2009.", "Michael Jungling - Merrill Lynch", "So it is still okay to say that after Q1 of 2009, SG&A costs will decrease because the monitoring cost will go away?", "Jim Crines", "Well, as I said the opportunity is there and as David said on our fourth quarter we'll come out with more specific guidance with respect to SG&A and other parts of the P&L on our fourth quarter call.", "Michael Jungling - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. So it's quite possible that will reinvest that and perhaps SG&A does not change in 2009 materially.", "Jim Crines", "It's [possible].", "Michael Jungling - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart of Credit Suisse.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Hi, thanks for taking my call. I didn't mean to hop on it, but I just want to go back to your level of confidence with respect to the fact that you've lost some surgeons now, and I can appreciate that you are not regaining that business in your '09 forecast, but what really gives you the confidence that this isn't just the beginning of additional market share losses and losses of surgeon contacts and can you just put this into context in what has been always characterizes the industry from market share shifts and surgeons are moving to other manufactures is not very likely.", "Dave Dvorak", "Yeah, and again, we have undergone some pretty significant disruption because of the variety of subject matters that I talked about earlier in the call, Kristen, so it isn't just the compliance program, but the confidence level is really derived by a lot of conversations that we have had, and day-to-day contact with people, and the advancements that we are making in implementing this program as well. The program structure is the right track for the future. We firmly believe that. We're in an execution mode, and as we continue to progress through this, we're going to see some stabilization on that front. That doesn't mean that there won't be additional customer losses, but we have characterized those losses, and that's the basis for believing that come in the second half of 2009, we're going to see our top line begin to accelerate. So we think that the fourth quarter is likely to be the high watermark for that activity, and we'll stabilize in the first half of the year, 2009, that is, and then begin to improve our top line thereafter.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Okay. And just the playing field here just seems to be leveled, I guess, with respect to what the DOJ has mandated. So do you feel that it is truly just the fact that you are going to a more conservative model and that's the reason for some of the losses? I guess, I'm just having a hard time understanding why these customers are going to other companies?", "Dave Dvorak", "Well, I mean, we're going to the place that we think we're going to need to be for the next five, eight, 10 years at this point in time, so we're not going to undergo disruption in the future on the same basis, I think that if people try to incrementalize this change, they are going to subject themselves to further disruptions, so we think that this is the right long-term solution.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Thanks very much.", "Dave Dvorak", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan.", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "Good morning, and thank you for taking the questions.", "Dave Dvorak", "Good morning.", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "I just want to clarify on the preliminary '09 commentary and the bottom line. You have had in the last two quarters about $0.12 of gains from your investment sales, so if you are talking high single-digits off of your adjusted 403 to 408 number, if we backed out the gains, you do have in 2008, it does end up becoming more like 10% to 12%. So if you were at 7 to 9 before in terms of the how you are thinking, about '09 EPS growth, backing that $0.12 out will get you more to a 10% to 12% growth rate? I just wanted to make sure we are all on the same page.", "Dave Dvorak", "Mike, that's fair, but I think you also have to consider, you know, the one-time costs that are running through the P&L this year.", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "Oh, [absolutely]. Yeah, I mean, all the other stuff, yeah. Just want to make sure we're just talking apples-to-apples.", "Dave Dvorak", "Sure.", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "I do understand on the third quarter, you know, if we look at the performance, I think, we would find that most people probably would surprise on the OUS businesses more than the US business in terms of how sales growth came in. And the surprise that everybody does think of everything that is going on in the industry is primarily a US event because it was the US Department of Justice, the US agreement. But is it your view that it's -- the compliance programs you are putting in place globally, that are impacting your non-US businesses, is that what you are saying? ", "Dave Dvorak", "It's had an effect, sure. ", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "And so what -- what else is having an effect on the non-US businesses? ", "Dave Dvorak", "Well, I mean, the most significant other factor that, I don't know, we have highlighted heavily enough is just the pricing changes in Asia-Pacific, that had a dramatic effect on our growth rate. Probably 6 points worth of growth taken away by virtue of the price impact in Japan and Australia, primarily.", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "In Japan, starting in April?", "Dave Dvorak", "That's correct. ", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "Okay. So if we look that, the Asia-Pacific was much stronger in the second quarter than it was in the third quarter. So the delta from Q2 to Q3 wouldn't be in Japan, but you said there was the price cut in Australia? ", "Dave Dvorak", "That is correct. ", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "Okay. Anything else that played out between Q2 and Q3 that you'd highlight?", "Dave Dvorak", "Nothing else of significance, Mike.", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then as we -- as we think about your mix right now, you haven't been able to execute on your product launches the way you would have liked for 2008, and you have commented on that. I'd like to get just a better read on, if we looked at your revenue growth right now? Where would volumes be and where would mix be? I think we have a sense of where price falls out by now, but where is your mix today, because obviously the implication from everything you've said and what we've seen in the business is that your mix benefit has been greatly diminished here because of the lack of product launches?", "Dave Dvorak", "Yeah, without getting too specific, you know, we talked about that mix benefit opportunity being in the 1% to 3% range, across the market. And we would expect typically to be at the high-end of that range. I think it's fair to say that we're not quite at the high-end of that rage, but there is still mix benefit reflected in our results coming from, you know, products that we launched in 2007, and those that we put out this year and talked about the growth, you know, we saw for example, in the Natural-Knee Gender Flex product in the third quarter, at 40%. 15% growth in Hinge Knees, so we are still, Mike, getting some mixed benefit in -- the more -- at least with respect to this quarter -- the more significant fact there, you know, kind of impacting on the difference between our performance and the market is -- has more to do with these customer losses in the quarter.", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "Got you, okay. Listen, thanks for taking the questions.", "Dave Dvorak", "You're welcome. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "Good morning. Maybe just one more question on the compliance issues. I guess maybe some of the hang-up here is that it seems like you guys are taking the pain now by getting out in front of what may be more substantial congressional action in the next couple of years, at which point the whole industry would convert and effectively re-level the playing field without the share losses on the part of the competitors that you are taking. Is that a fair characterization of how you expect this to play out? Or do you think that as the rest of the industry goes through this same transformation in the next two or three years that you are substantially take share?", "Dave Dvorak", "Well, it is tough to comment what competitors are doing with respect to implementing programs and what their practices are at this point in time. What we're staying focused on is the right program for this company, and to ensure that we get the input that we need from surgeons and have the relationships structured and managed in the right way. So that's going to prevail over the course of this and I don't think it'll just be legislative branch. I think that you are going to have continued enforcement actions, I think that the public is going to pay a lot of attention as these transparency initiatives take hold.", "So on a variety of different fronts this is going to be a topic that is going to accelerate from hearing something about it every month in the past to daily [proved] points that one has to manage these relationships in a very careful manner. So that is what we are establishing in our practices. It is what we're establishing in our culture, and we think that it is going to be a prevailing view in the long-term, but if we implement this program in the right way, and we are able to innovate, and to train and educate in the right manner, well we have a model to succeed in the future market, so that\u2019s what we are going.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "Okay. And as you think about having begun to reengage with doctors, can you put them on a scale of your 20% of the way reengaged, 10%, 50? In terms of, kind of, trying to quantify or at least characterize the potential future, kind of, share losses here?", "Dave Dvorak", "Yeah, I think, you know, engagement level. I'd say that we are at the 50 plus percent mark, and by the time we exit this year, we are going to be at the 75 plus percent mark. And by the time we complete the first quarter of next year we should be at full speed.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "Okay, great. And just one quick numbers question, maybe for Jim. If currency holds steady from where we are today, even as best as, and I know it's changing, what would be the top line headwind and the gross margin headwind, understanding, of course, that you are hedged to the bottom line?", "Jim Crines", "Yeah. I don't know that I'll be able to answer at this point, Ben. That's something I'll have to get into when we can get in to more specific guidance on the fourth quarter call.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Roman of Morgan Stanley.", "David Roman - Morgan Stanley", "Hi, good morning, everyone and thank you for taking the question. Just on the guidance for 2008, this is the second time we have seen a reduction in guidance, due to the, I guess compliance and initiative programs. What gives you confidence in the numbers this time around? I mean where does the $60 million to $80 million reduction come from and why should we see that number not be worse in the fourth quarter?", "Jim Crines", "Yeah. David, you can look at where that puts us relative to the market and where it puts us relative to either the third quarter, or for that matter year-to-date growth rates for our core franchises, hips and knees. And I think it's principally it's hips and knees where we're experiencing the customer losses.", "I think you'll find what we have forecasted for the fourth quarter is on a constant currency basis. Our overall revenue is flat, slightly up compared to prior year. I think we're very comfortable with this adjustment with what we have forecasted for the full year.", "David Roman - Morgan Stanley", "And then when you sort of embarked on a thing, new compliance initiative in April, what sort of surprise you over the past six months, and was it the customer response, was it the level of, sort of investment needed to bring this compliance program to fruition? What sort of changed over the last couple of months?", "Jim Crines", "It's just the excuse time, it's a significant amount of work, and we're driving this out in a simultaneous fashion across all of the business units and all the geographic segments, so that's a lot of work for the organization to push through and we're making a lot of progress.", "David Roman - Morgan Stanley", "And did you find surgeons to be less collaborative in the process than you expected?", "Jim Crines", "I think that the vast majority of surgeons have responded very favorably.", "David Roman - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, except those obviously are ones that you mention as sort of defecting this quarter. But I guess one other question, on David it's the comment you made earlier about making steps now as to not have to revisit the compliance issues later.", "Is there a sense that companies that might have been less thorough in the compliance process are going to need to step up investment in compliance sometime down the road?", "Dave Dvorak", "It is tough for me to comment on, David. I think that's a question you are just going to have to pose to the other companies, and we'll have to watch and see how things play out. I don't think that this is going to be an area that is unique just to our sector. I think that you are going to see this is a significant issue across a broad array of medical device companies in the coming months and years.", "It's the same challenge that exists in those different contexts, and I think that the orthopedic sector is probably out ahead of some of the other sectors in that regard. The longer-term, I will tell you that my view is that these compliance programs are going to be thought of as being a significant and required piece of infrastructure just as quality systems are seen that way because of what's been focused on over the proceeding years in that area.", "David Roman - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, that makes perfect sense. And then just lastly for Jim, on the share buyback and the Abbott deal. Is the Abbott deal a signal that you are certainly going to pull back on share repurchases going forward given where the stock price is, and the level which you had bought back shares, is there any with respect to your capital allocation plans?", "Dave Dvorak", "No, there are no changes. That was clearly the case in the third quarter but that deal is now closed and as we generate free cash flow and have cash available on hand and are not otherwise looking at anything on the immediate horizon in the way of further investments, we would put that cash to used through the authorized share repurchase program that we now have in place.", "David Roman - Morgan Stanley", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Jim Crines", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets.", "Unidentified Analyst", "(Inaudible) for Joanne, can you hear me?", "Dave Dvorak", "Yes.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, guys. I just had a couple of questions about the Abbott acquisition, given the $20 million that you are putting in your guidance, how does that breakout geographically.", "Jim Crines", "It's about three quarters US based and the balance outside of the US.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And how should we think about the run-rate or the contribution to your top-line next year? Is that 80?", "Jim Crines", "This transaction closed in mid-October, so they did a little over $100 million in revenues in 2007, and again, we'll continue to spike out what it's contributing on a quarterly basis, but I would reference at this point back to the slightly more than $100 million in revenue that they did in 2007.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Fair enough. And of the [dime] dilution, how does that hit the P&L?", "Jim Crines", "They are spending a fair amount of money on R&D as a percentage of their total revenues, so some of that would come through in higher R&D costs as a percentage of total revenue, and then the balance of that would come through in intangibles, amortization and the interest cost on the deal.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And just switching gears, you talked about having a stronger second half of '09 and highlighted a new hip product. Are there other areas that you would highlight that you think you would come back strong in the second half?", "Dave Dvorak", "On the product introduction side the new [nail] offering is another contributor for that growth. And then obviously we're going to be picking up the OSP revenues as well as those products become available again.", "Unidentified Analyst", "All right. Okay. Fair enough. Thank you, guys.", "Dave Dvorak", "You are welcome", "Jim Crines", "[Laurie], in respect of our attendee's time, let's take one more question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Matson of Wachovia Capital.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I know you mentioned that you had done some work on the future structuring of our royalty agreement, but I was wondering what we can expect around the royalty agreements that have already been in place? I know that there has been some rumblings that you are looking at sort of buying those out or something? Is that something that's still potentially going to happen, and if so, when and what would the P&L impact be?", "Jim Crines", "That is happening. Some of that take place, in fact in the third quarter and will continue on to the third quarter and the first quarter of next year. And I would tell you that the P&L impact at this point is expected to be neutral. Now those arrangements would cause us to buyout rights to technology and doing that recognize an intangible asset on the balance sheet that would be amortized over the life of that technology and as we look at it at this point at least, sort of lines up with what we would otherwise be incurring in royalty expenses.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital", "Okay. Then, any impact on your gross margin, as you bring the new Ireland plant online?", "Dave Dvorak", "No, again, in getting that plant up and running, we're taking the processes that have been manufacturing processes that have been developed in Warsaw, and transferring those into that facility. I think initially, we may see some slightly higher unit costs on femoral components, just given the amount of time that it takes to get up to the point where they are operating at sort of full capacity, but otherwise we would not expect that to really have much of an impacts on our gross margin ratio in the aggregate.", "Operator", "Thank you. I will now turn the call to David Dvorak for closing remarks.", "Dave Dvorak", "Thanks, again, everyone for joining us today, and for your continued interested in Zimmer. We look forward to speaking to you on our fourth quarter and year-end conference call, which will be held on Thursday, January 29th at 8:00 A.M. I'll now turn the call back over to you, Laurie.", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

(ZMH) Q4 2008 Earnings Call January 29, 2009  8:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Paul Blair - VP of IR", "David Dvorak - President and CEO", "Jim Crines - EVP of Finance and CFO", "Analysts", "Rick Wise - Leerink Swann", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W.

I would like to welcome you to the Zimmer Fourth Quarter 2008 Earnings Call. Joining me today to host this call are David Dvorak, President and Chief Executive Officer and Jim Crines, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, we'll review our performance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2008, provide you with an update on certain key matters, present our outlook for 2009 and conclude our discussion with a question and answer session.", "Before we get started I would like to point out, that this presentation contains forward-looking statements within the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the orthopedics industry, management's beliefs, and assumptions made by management.", "These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.", "For a list and description of the risks and uncertainties, see the disclosure materials filed by Zimmer with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Zimmer disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.", "This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of such information to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, along with other financial and statistical information for the periods to be presented on this conference call, was included in the press release announcing our earnings, which may be accessed from the Zimmer website at www.zimmer.com under the section entitled Investor Relations.", "A rebroadcast of this call will be available from approximately two hours following the conclusion of today's call through the end of the day on February 12, 2009 and can also be accessed from the Investor Relations section of the Zimmer website.", "At this time, I would like to introduce David Dvorak, President and Chief Executive Officer of Zimmer.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you, Paul, and good morning everyone. It's a pleasure to be addressing you in this New Year to report on 2008 and to discuss our outlook for 2009. First I'll comment on our fourth quarter and full year 2008 results.", "Consolidated sales for the fourth quarter of $1.030 billion were down 0.8% in constant currency from the prior year fourth quarter, and down 4% reported with a negative 3.2% foreign currency impact.", "Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1, a decrease of 15% compared with the prior year. Knee revenues were up slightly in the fourth quarter with a 1% constant currency increase.", "Hip sales fell 3% in constant currency during the fourth quarter and our remaining business categories for the fourth quarter on a constant currency basis, Extremities was up 7% over the prior year period, Trauma was up 4%, Spine increased by 33% with the inclusion of Abbott Spine and Dental declined 10%.", "Finally, our Orthopedic Surgical Products business was down 19% for the quarter, due to the continued impact of the previously announced voluntary suspension of production. The strength of the US dollar led to a negative currency translation effect of $35 million on sales in the quarter.", "As we've discussed before, the top line impact of currency fluctuations is largely neutralized on the bottom line due to our hedging program. During the quarter we generated operating cash flow of $207 million.", "For the full year of 2008, our net sales totaled more than $4 billion for the first time in the company's history, more than tripling our sales in 2001. Zimmer's first year as a public company.", "At $4.1 billion, our 2008 net sales represented an increase of 6% over 2007, reflecting 3% constant currency growth over the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the full year were $4.05, inclusive of one-time gains of $24 million after tax or $0.10 per share recorded during the second and third quarters.", "In a year that could only be described as challenging, we recorded $924 million in adjusted net earnings and $550 million in free cash flow, evidencing the fundamental strength of our business.", "We entered 2009 with confidence that we will reestablish positive momentum in our overall business and restore revenue growth as 2009 progresses. Our challenges in 2008 included the global implementation of our enhanced business model.", "We made significant progress in the fourth quarter on a variety of the related issues impacting our business. The 2009 needs assessments have been completed and approved, key product development programs were solidified, and a large number of our outstanding payment obligations to consultants were brought up to date.", "We have an improved royalty model in place and we're moving forward with development teams for new innovative products and technologies. We responded to our disruption in training and education events by developing a completely new model that we believe sets new standards for the industry. We resumed surgical skills training events as early as the second quarter of 2008, and are continuing to ramp up other training activities.", "If you've been on our website since the consultant payments update was posted earlier this month, you'll see that we made a substantial number of surgeon and other consulting payments that had been delayed as a result of the DPA process.", "In 2008, we also executed on our plan to establish third party mechanisms to oversee certain of Zimmer's educational and charitable contributions.", "And we are currently developing a new process by which an internal committee of non-sales representatives will assess and act upon request for other forms of direct financial support and grants, including such things as medical education, unrestricted research and charitable activities.", "We responded aggressively to the issues that we uncovered at orthopedic surgical products business and have now begun to return affected products to the market. We will be working hard to win back the OSP business that we had to forego for most of 2008.", "The Durom Cup matter was clearly another challenging issue in 2008, but again, we did the right things. Our people responded appropriately, and we continued to offer this product together with a comprehensive set of training opportunities for users. We moved ahead with investments in infrastructure and instruments that we believe can be leveraged to drive improved service levels with greater efficiency.", "We are now in a better position to be responsive to future demand growth in the field and provide the highest possible levels of customer service. These investments are for the most part complete.", "Meanwhile, we didn't standstill in the business development area, concluding an acquisition of Abbott Spine that broadens our product line and adds greater breadth to our sales force reach.", "Finally, we have added key management talent to our organization, including two seasoned healthcare executives to head our reconstructive and global businesses groups. In addition, over the past couple of years, we have installed new presidents in our trauma, spine, dental and OSP divisions.", "For 2009, we are continuing to provide full year guidance rather than breaking out quarterly estimates. We think this full year approach better reflects how we run the business for long-term success, not near-term expediency.", "We expect full year revenues for 2009 to increase between 1% and 3% on a constant currency basis, with revenues anticipated to be flat in the first half of the year and improving thereafter.", "We are projecting full year adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $3.85 to $4, with negative growth expected in the first three quarters and positive growth projected for the fourth quarter.", "Clearly, 2009 will be a pivotal year and our top priority is very clear. We must stabilize our core knee and hip franchises, which are the foundation of our overall business. New products are key to our business, and we are excited about our plans for 2009.", "On the Knee side, we believe our introductions in 2007 and 2008 give us the most comprehensive portfolio in the industry. We seek to maximize our potential with what we believe are among the industry's strongest brands.", "At the AAOS meeting in February, we will be introducing patient-specific instruments to complement these brands and we plan to begin marketing these systems in the second quarter of this year.", "In Hips, we've clearly had some gaps, especially on the Acetabular side. We look forward to bringing new solutions to the market in the second half of the year to address these gaps and fully leverage our strong portfolio of stems.", "We see opportunities in our other businesses as well, continued expansion of our Extremities portfolio, the restoration of our OSP product line to the market.", "In Trauma, the new Nail System, you've heard us describe is expected to hit the market this year. And in Spine, we will continue to grow the Abbott Spine portfolio, along with our existing product line through our new, combined distribution network.", "Regarding our enhanced compliance program, we expect there will be additional refinements along the way, but Zimmer's guiding principles are clear. The major disruptions are behind us and we are moving forward.", "With the recent adoption of the AdvaMed code of ethics on interactions with healthcare professionals, many of our practices will now be included in the code of conduct for the medical device industry, and we consider that a recognition that we've been on the right path all along.", "Finally, I want to underscore emphasis on quality initiatives. In 2009, we will continue with company-wide implementation of quality system improvements. Over the past several years, we've greatly enhanced our quality programs, expanded our quality assurance staff, and are now applying these uniformly high standards across our businesses.", "So in 2009, you should expect a return to positive momentum from Zimmer. We relish the opportunity to focus our full attention and energy on realizing our market opportunities, and we are encouraged by what 2009 will bring.", "We want to thank the customers, who supported us in dealing with our recent challenges. We look forward to working with them to drive new solutions that address patient issues in our growing markets.", "Jim will now provide further details on the quarter, the year and our guidance.", "Jim Crines", "Thanks, David. I will review our performance in the quarter and for 2008 in more detail, and then provide some additional information related to our guidance.", "Sales of $1.03 billion for the quarter reflect a decrease of 0.8% constant currency and 4% reported. These results reflect greater than anticipated headwind from foreign currency as well as lower reconstructive sales relative to expectations.", "The US dollar continued to strengthen during the quarter and as a consequence foreign currency translations decreased revenue by 3.2% or $35 million in the quarter. Consolidated pricing was down 0.8 percentage points for the quarter, in the Americas price was flat for the quarter, while Europe and Asia-Pacific results include negative price of minus 1% and minus 3.5% respectively.", "Turning to our fourth quarter revenue growth by major product category: worldwide reconstructive sales decreased 1.4% in constant currency and 5.1% reported. Knee sales in the fourth quarter grew a modest 0.8% constant currency, reflecting slower unit growth across all geographic segments combined with lower pricing on a global basis. Knee pricing on a global basis was down 1.5 percentage points in the quarter, principally as a result of the lower reimbursement prices now in effect in Japan and Australia.", "Flex Knees accounted for 52% of our Knee unit sales on a global basis in the fourth quarter, maintaining penetration levels above 50%. As we discussed during the third quarter call, we have lost market share in Knees as a result of various factors including the implementation of our enhanced global compliance program.", "Looking back at the final market results for the third quarter we estimate that our Knee results reflect the loss of approximately half a point of market share in the third quarter. Our fourth quarter results continue to lag market and as such reflect additional share loss which we estimate one point in the quarter. This brings our total estimated loss in global Knee market share to 1.5 points.", "As David indicated in his remarks, significant progress was made in the fourth quarter towards enhancing our competitiveness including, for example the fact that the '09 Knees assessments have been completed and key product development initiatives have progressed.", "These and other initiatives we have underway are essential to stabilizing our share position in the global Knee market. Countering the effect of customer losses, our natural Knee sales increased over 15% in the quarter on a dollar basis following a recent introduction of the gender solutions femoral component for that system.", "Also with the launch of our new mobile bearing knee and the new segmental knee, unit sales for these products increased 22% and 6% respectively over the third quarter. In the fourth quarter Knee sales in constant currency increased 1.2% in the Americas, 1.2% in Europe, and declined 1.9% in Asia-Pacific respectively. The Asia-Pacific results reflect the 5.8% reduction in average selling prices.", "Hip sales declined 3.2% in the quarter, reflecting current product gaps and the impact of training disruption, as well as customer losses which all together contribute to the shortfall in Hip revenues relative to market.", "Again, looking back, we estimate the third quarter share loss in Hips at 1.5 points and with our fourth quarter results continuing to lag the market we estimate additional share loss in the fourth quarter of approximately 0.5 point, bringing our total share loss in the global Hip market to 2 points.", "As we consider the actions necessary to enhance our competitiveness in Hips, among everything's we look to the anticipated launch of Acetabular Hip products in 2009 to fully capitalize on the Hip Stem products that have been launched during the past 12 to 18 months. These Hip Stem products were primary contributors during the fourth quarter and much of 2008 and include M/L Taper with Kinectiv technology, our [Avner] for the European market and recently released Fitmore bone conserving stem.", "On a geographic basis and in constant currency, fourth quarter Hip sales decreased 3.6% in the Americas, 1.9% in Europe, and 5.7% in Asia-Pacific. The latter of which includes negative pricing of 4.1%.", "Extremity sales for the quarter in constant currency increased 6.8% on a challenging comp with 30% in the fourth quarter of 2007. Dental sales on a constant currency basis decreased 10.1% for the quarter on a challenging prior year comp of 24%.", "Disruption in training and education, turnover in our dental sales force, competition from low priced suppliers and turmoil in the global economy continue to impact on dental revenues. I believe these disruptive factors are temporal and we are taking steps to reposition this business for future growth.", "Trauma sales in the quarter were up over the prior year period 4.1% constant currency. On a constant currency basis trauma sales in the quarter decreased 0.6% in the Americas, increased 12.3% in Asia-Pacific, and increased 8.3% in Europe.", "Zimmer Spine reported 32.5% constant currency growth in the quarter. This growth is driven by the Abbott Spine acquisition, which was completed during the quarter and contributed $22 million of incremental Spine sales in the quarter.", "Finally, Orthopedic Surgical Products and other sales declined 19.3% constant currency in the quarter as a result of the previously announced voluntary suspension in sales of certain patient care products, partially offset by bone, cement, and accessories sales which grew over prior year.", "Remediation efforts at our Dover facility continue to progress and as we said in the third quarter we look forward to stocking shelves and putting the OSP products back in the sales bag.", "I'll focus now on the rest of the income statements. Our adjusted gross profit margin of 76.8% for the quarter is up 40 basis points from the prior year fourth quarter. Foreign currency hedge gains accounted for the improvement in gross margin with idle plant cost and excess and obsolete inventory charges partially offsetting the gains.", "Compared to last year's fourth quarter, R&D expense as a percentage of sales decreased to 4.6%, and at $47 million for the quarter, 6.9% below prior year. The decrease is a result of reduced surgeon collaboration activities in the areas of external research, product development, medical education and clinical affairs.", "As we are planning to invest in surgeon training and education, and in new development programs in 2009, our R&D expense as a percentage of revenue is expected to return to historical levels of 5% to 6%.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $436 million in the fourth quarter, and are up 8.6% over prior year. At 42.3% of sales, SG&A expenses are 490 basis points above the prior year, inclusive of the significant one-time fees and expenses associated with compliance, with the resolution agreements and the implementation of our enhanced business model.", "Acquisition, integration and other amounted to $43.1 million in the quarter, comprised of costs pertaining to the Abbott Spine and prior period acquisitions including an in-process research and development charge, facility consolidation costs, legal fees and retention and termination payments.", "During the quarter, based on the volume of claims submitted to-date, we also revised our estimates for anticipated claims pertaining to the Durom Cup. This resulted in an increase in our provision for these claims from $47.5 million to $69 million and a charge to pre-tax earnings in the quarter of $21.5 million. This provision is classified as a non-recurring item and is, therefore, excluded from our non-GAAP earnings measure.", "Adjusted operating profit in the quarter decreased 16.3% to $308.1 million. At 29.9%, adjusted operating profit sales ratio decreased by 440 basis points from prior year as a result of lower revenues and the significant step-up in SG&A costs.", "Interest expense for the quarter amounted to $4.2 million, principally resulting from financing the Abbott Spine acquisition. Adjusted net earnings decreased 18.6% compared to prior year. At $224.6 million, an adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 15.3% to $1 on 224.2 million average outstanding diluted shares.", "These adjusted earnings per share are inclusive of approximately $0.06 of share-based compensation. At $0.75, reported diluted earnings per share includes certain one-time cost connected with the Abbott Spine acquisition, as well as the additional provision for Durom claims, and as such, decreased 33% from prior year fourth quarter reported EPS of $1.12.", "At 26.1% adjusted for the quarter, our effective tax rate reflects a favorable year-to-date adjustments to bring the effective tax rate for the year to 26.9%. This is below our first half estimates and 60 basis points below our full year 2007 ETR, due to favorable geographic mix of earnings and profits.", "During the quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares at a total purchase price of $48.1 million, or an average price per share of $40.47. We used cash to acquire the shares under a $1.25 billion repurchase authorization, which expires at the end of 2009.", "Cash outlays for the Abbott Spine business and surgeon payments reduced the amount of cash available for share repurchases during the quarter.", "For the year, we repurchased 10.7 million shares for $737 million, approximately 1.13 billion remains authorized under our current repurchase program. The company had approximately 223 million shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2008, down from 225 million as of September 30, 2008.", "Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $206.9 million, down from $421.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. In the quarter, we resolved a large number of our outstanding payments to healthcare professionals and institutions, resulting in substantial cash outflows compared to prior-year.", "We made substantial payments to third-party service providers for work completed in connection with the global rollout of our enhanced compliance program. We settled the large number of product liability claims and we invested in the build-out of inventory pipeline for certain new products we are preparing to launch in 2009.", "Inventory days on hand finished the quarter at 344 days. Our trade accounts receivable days sales outstanding finished the quarter at 59 days. Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter amounted to $79.1 million.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $112 million, including $51 million for instruments and $61 million for property, plant and equipment. Cash outlays associated with investing activities during the quarter also include $363 million for the Abbott Spine acquisition and $109 million for the acquisition of intellectual property rights, in place of future royalty payments under certain of our legacy license agreement. Finally, free cash flow was $94.7 million for the quarter.", "I'd like to turn now to our guidance for 2009. In our press release this morning, we announced that the company expects full year revenues to increase from 1% to 3% in constant currency, when compared to 2008, with revenues anticipated to be flat during the first half of the year and improving thereafter.", "At this time, assuming currency rates remain at year-end 2008 levels, we anticipate foreign currency translation will reduce our reported 2009 revenues by an estimated 4%. Therefore, on a reported basis, our revenues are projected to be in a range of minus 3% to negative 1%, compared with 2008.", "And with currency translation effect expected to be more pronounced in the first half, revenues on a reported basis are likely to be below this range during the first half of the year.", "With respect to certain of the underlying assumptions we are well aware that various independent research reports projecting a moderate temporary slowdown in elective hospital procedures including Knee and Hip arthroplasty procedures. We think it's important not to overemphasize this impact our core, Knee and Hip franchises remain more insulated than most from the swings in a broader economy.", "Moreover, the need for these procedures does not vanish even if the timing is affected. For planning purposes, however, we have assumed in an estimated step down in global market growth of Knee and Hip procedures 200 basis points. With this assumed step down in procedure growth, we anticipate constant currency dollar growth of 6% for the global Knee and Hip markets, compared with recent trends of 8% to 9%.", "We assume pricing across the broader market will be flat. Zimmer's Knee revenues are expected to be slightly negative in constant currency for the full year, while our Hip revenues given the more significant product challenges we will face at least in the first half of the year are projected to decline to mid single-digits in constant currency for 2009.", "Relative to the fourth quarter of 2008, our full year 2009 forecast for Hip and Knee revenues implies a further estimated loss in market share of up to half a point in each of these franchises. The share loss is expected to stabilize by year end 2009 as we anniversary out of the majority of the 2008 customer and product related losses and as we launch new products in sufficient quantity such that we can begin to recover some of the product related losses in 2009.", "Among our other product franchises, extremities and trauma are expected to be in line with market. Dental revenues given the weak economy combined with company specific operational challenges are expected to underperform relative to market.", "And finally, Spine revenues on a pro forma basis, assuming Abbott Spine as they combine with Zimmer Spine for the full year 2008 are projected to be below market as a consequence of anticipated sales to synergies associated with the ongoing integration of the two businesses.", "Adjusted earnings are expected to show negative growth in the first three quarters with positive growth in the fourth quarter. 2009 full year adjusted diluted earnings per share for 2009 are projected to be in a range of $3.85 to $4.", "Assuming currency rates remain at year end 2008 levels, we expect our gross margin ratio to improve as compared with 2008, principally as a consequence of the anticipated recognition of gains on hedge contracts in 2009, contrasted with the hedge losses recorded in 2008.", "Although the ratio is expected to improve, year-over-year comparisons of gross profit dollars are expected to be unfavorable in the first half, and improve thereafter. Our operating expenses will be impacted by a number of factors which in the aggregate are expected to result in a modest net increase in total expense over 2008.", "As we exit 2008, we expect to realize significant savings in third party fees related to compliance with the resolution agreements and the implementation of our enhanced business model. For 2009, however, we intend to offset those savings with a significant increase in spending in areas that suffered major disruption in 2008, including product development and medical education.", "Our plan also reflects the dilution related to the Abbott Spine acquisition, which in part is captured in higher operating expenses. We also continue to step up our level of spending on quality systems to achieve our continuous improvement objectives in the areas of design and process control as well as ongoing product surveillance.", "The interest expense and other line of our P&L is expected to be unfavorable year-over-year as we take on the cost of financing the Abbott Spine acquisition and a portion of our 2008 share repurchases, contrasted with the significant capital gains reported in 2008. This of course will be most pronounced in the third quarter.", "We anticipate a tax rate of around 27.5%, above our final rate for 2008 due to a higher mix of earnings and profits from higher tax jurisdictions in 2009. We anticipate the diluted weighted average shares outstanding for 2009 to be between 216 million and 217 million shares. This assumes available free cash flow will be deployed principally to repurchase shares in 2009.", "To arrive at our GAAP earnings per share you should subtract projected acquisition integration and other costs of approximately $45 million pre-tax, and inventory step up amortization of $13 million pre-tax, or approximately $0.17 per share.", "Turning to cash flow, we anticipate total capital expenditures in the range of $390 million to $410 million, instrument capital in 2009 is expected to be in a range of $160 million to $170 million. Traditional PP&E is expected to be in a range of $230 million to $240 million, reflecting the cash outlays necessary to complete capital expansions initiated in 2008, as well as new product related investments and normal replacements of older machinery and equipment for 2009.", "David, I'll turn the call back over to you.", "David Dvorak", "Thanks, Jim. We believe we acted in the best interest of all key stakeholders in addressing the challenges we faced in 2008. We intend to continue to focus on providing meaningful innovation, effective products and return on our investments.", "We've described for you our approach to 2009. In the short-term, we'll prioritize those activities that will restore momentum in our core business and drive growth in our global businesses. We're confident that long-term success will follow. We're bullish about our industry, one that will continue to grow, not just because of demographics, but because we help enable physicians to improve the quality of life for their patients.", "Now, I'd like to open the call to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Rick Wise of Leerink Swann.", "Rick Wise - Leerink Swann", "Good morning, everybody. A couple of questions, can you talk a little bit more about the Knee weakness, surprisingly if it does. First, were you surprised? Second, do you think that the new Hips will turn things around? So, one, do you expect to see that turnaround starting early in the year or is this a process that's going to take the full year?", "David Dvorak", "I think on the Knee side of things, obviously there has been a combination of factors that have contributed to the performance declining in the second half of 2008. The most significant of those really have been the training and education slowdown. As we said, we got some of the surgical institute events back up and running at the end of the second quarter, but that pace continues to accelerate and the full offering of medical education events is now being implemented. So we'll see improvement on that front.", "We have some other offerings that I discussed in my script that we'll be unveiling at the academy meeting as well and then the collaborative relationships with surgeons contributed to that as well, Rick. So I think that we have ironed out many of those root causes of the instability in our Knee business and we'll see that stabilize as the year progresses.", "It's also important to note that even on the Knee side, some of these disruptive factors that we faced in 2008 causes the sales force to end up in a pretty defensive mode and we're seeing the beginnings of our group of sales force folks getting reoriented towards going on the offense, and you're going to see more and more in the sequential progression of our revenue growth in 2009 on that front.", "Hips, all the same factors would apply on that side as well, but here you also have some pretty significant product gaps and some field actions in the Durom area that were disruptive in 2008. We feel very strongly about the quality of our current stem offering, have some great innovations that are currently in the marketplace, but the pacing items to restore the growth rate to our hip business, we see as being the introduction of the cup side.", "On the Acetabular Cup side we're going to have at least two significant offerings in the second half of 2009. So they're not going to help our performance in the first half, they will in the second half and we would expect to finish the year with some positive momentum going into 2010 in that category.", "Rick Wise - Leerink Swann", "Very helpful. Just two quick follow-ups. You highlighted that you expected the new products to fill in the product gaps in the product lines, both product lines. Do the new products totally get you where you need to be? And the second question, maybe just a little more on 2009 guidance, clearly higher R&D spending is going to pressure EPS. I am curious to hear your thoughts about when we start to see the positive leverage and is that more sales driven fourth quarter or do we have to wait till 2010?", "David Dvorak", "Sure. The first question, on the Hip side, it will address all of the needs that we have with the exception of resurfacing in the United States market. But every other need that we have on the Acetabular Cup side will be addressed with second half of the year offerings. Jim, why don't you turn to the leverage question on the P&L?", "Jim Crines", "Sure. Rick, the first time you would see leverage in the P&L would be in the fourth quarter of 2009, is when you would begin to see that return. If you're looking purely at EPS growth, if you look on the other hand at operating profit and this has a lot to do with the fact that we had significant capital gains reported below operating profit in the third quarter of 2008, you would begin to see some modest leverage in the third quarter the way we see things developing over the course of 2009.", "Rick Wise - Leerink Swann", "Thank you very much.", "Jim Crines", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson of Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Thanks, guys. Jim, maybe you could just touch on, intangibles up about $130 million on the balance sheet. I'm assuming that's the buyout on the contracts. Just wondering how this is going to flow through over the next couple years? And does that go through the R&D line, or is that part of the reason SG&A is up next year as well?", "Jim Crines", "Well, first of all, as we said before on the buyout of the future royalty obligations under those legacy license agreements, we made a lot of progress on that obviously in the fourth quarter, paid out $109 million for the acquisition of intellectual property rights under those agreements.", "That has been recorded as an asset and will get amortized over the life of those products and that just so happens to line up with the royalties that were otherwise getting recorded under those obligations.", "So there's no sort of incremental operating expense, if you will, and because those royalty expenses have historically been recorded in cost of goods, the amortization of those intangible, those technology assets will be amortized in costs of goods as well.", "Now, the other increase we recorded, the other thing we recognized over the course of the quarter was the preliminary purchase price allocation associated with the Abbott Spine deal. That resulted in the addition of another $75 million in intangible assets and those assets will be amortized over a period of 10 years.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Okay, great. Thanks. And David, maybe you could just address on the OSP side, I know you had been talking about re-launching some of those products late in Q4 and substantially all of them by the end of Q1. I didn't hear those same comments this time. How do you see those products rolling out over the next couple quarters?", "David Dvorak", "We were successful in reinitiating some of the products before the end of 2008. The balance of the products will be relaunched in the first and second quarter of this year. So there will be most the principal products, we will be successful at relaunching.", "I think the strategically most important of those products will be relaunched before the end of this quarter with the balance coming out in the second quarter of this year. And then obviously, it's going to take some time to ramp those sales back up, but that maybe a bit different and the different subset of the product offering Jeff.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Fair enough. And then qualitatively I guess David, and I know it's hard to tell but, should we think about those products just slowly recapturing some share over the first few quarters, and maybe taking that process out over a three to a four quarter period?", "David Dvorak", "Yes, I think that is a fairway to look at it. It's going to be staggered. The first of the products that were launched in the fourth quarter of this year, I would expect that we would be in decent shape at recapturing the market share that we have built into our model by the end of the year.", "So I do think that kind of a two to four quarter time period, and I don't think that it's reasonable to expect that we're going to recapture all that market share. So something better than half, but we'll keep you posted on that progress as we relaunch those products.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "All right, great. Then last question I guess from me. I know one month does not make a trend, but a lot of questions about what's going to happen as we fall off and hit new deductibles and copays et cetera in '09. Anything you can talk about qualitatively, I guess, industry-wide that you're seeing in January relative to maybe November-December trends on Hips and Knees?", "David Dvorak", "Well, the best we can do is what we reflected in the guidance, as Jim said, the kind of couple of percent slowdown in the market is consistent with what we've seen over the course of the last, say, four months at this point.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Is that couple hundred basis points that Jim was talking about, would you assume on an annualized basis that maybe gates through at a bigger impact in the first half and lesser impact in the back. Or how are you thinking about that?", "Jim Crines", "Hey, Jeff this is Jim. I guess the way we are thinking about it is that step down has happened to some degree in the fourth quarter and we'll see how that plays out once everybody's reported. And that will persist through 2009. At least for planning purposes, that's how we're thinking about it.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "All right, thanks. Very helpful, guys. Thank you.", "Jim Crines", "Thank you, Jeff.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell of UBS Equity Research.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS Equity Research", "Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. That was the point I was going to ask about. It looks to me like US Hip market may be like 3% in the quarter, ex-US 5% constant currency, US Knees a little under 7%, and ex-US maybe 3% which is closer to the 4% to 5% growth rate for the market. Is that in line with your thinking and do you think we're actually starting to see a small procedure dropout?", "Jim Crines", "The Hip grows very much in line with what we're seeing and what we're estimating for the fourth quarter, understanding that not everybody's reported yet.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS Equity Research", "Yeah. But we just plug what we thought was likely. And what gives you kind of confidence that we came to the same sort of conclusion that if the trend line was 5 points in units, it would be maybe 2.5 or 3 of units, which would get us down kind of to mid-single digits market. Have you done any analytics to kind of confirm the exposure to unit growth rate or is it just everybody's in the same boat and kind of making reasonable guesses?", "Jim Crines", "Yes. We're looking at as many sources of data as we can get our hands on, but it is a difficult thing to really pin down. Some of the data that we're looking at is relatively small samples across a number of hospitals in the US. And with that information in hand, we're making the best sort of guesses that we can, the best assumptions that we can at this point. But we do not have really access to hard data across the broader markets at this point.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS Equity Research", "I guess my final question is, our estimates show you the share losses that you've kind of outlined. We agree with those. What sort of analytics have you guys done internally to kind of say that 0.5% further erosion is kind of about where it will end? It certainly agrees with our survey work, but you have excellent access, of course, to the customer base. And how have you assessed the turmoil take trajectory of that loss?", "Jim Crines", "Well, it's done on an account-by-account basis by us, Bruce. So obviously we are rolling up all the information that we have in a very detailed fashion on those account relationships, the risk accounts, the opportunity accounts and then projecting things that we're doing to stabilize those relationships to arrive at the forecast that we're providing.", "So it's obviously a major assumption, but there are a lot of details that go into that side as opposed to the first line of inquiry, which is trying to project out what's happening unit-wise across customers that we may not be working with because they're with competitors, obviously.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS Equity Research", "Thanks so much.", "Jim Crines", "You are welcome, Bruce. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein of JPMorgan Securities.", "Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities", "Hi, there. Can you hear me?", "Jim Crines", "We can, Michael. Good morning.", "Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities", "Hey, great. Thanks for taking the questions. Let me be a little bit more direct and try and get arms around this. On the last conference call in October, you preliminarily thought that 2009 EPS would grow high single digits and now you basically have taken that down by $0.40 to $0.50. So that suggests that there has been a significant deterioration in the business over the last three months.", "And your fourth quarter was obviously disappointing, as we look at the different businesses relative to market growth. But the suggestion relative to with your '09 guidance is that it's gotten a lot worse, given that significant cut you're making in the three-month period. So help us get our arms around that. Thanks.", "David Dvorak", "Mike, this is David. Look, we finished out the year and did fall short of what we had hoped to accomplish on the top line. We have a lot more clarity as to what's happening with those existing relationships. We also have quite a bit more clarity as to what's happening in the market in general and obviously the economy has changed fairly dramatically.", "And the long and the short of it is we went through a month long process to put together the best operating plan we can to drive shareholder returns in the go-forward period and what we find is that we're going to have to spend money to put things back on track. We don't want to lose further market share and this is a plan that we think is the most constructive way to return the business to an operating pattern that it ought to be at.", "So, rather than going tight on dollars that are going to be necessary to put things back on track, both in the product development side and the medical education side; we're going to show that kind of leverage as we emerge from this year, but you're going to see leveraged earnings as Jim laid out in the fourth quarter as opposed to something that would reach high single-digits across the year on a blended basis.", "Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities", "The guidance on the top line for 2009, obviously you are suggesting that ex-currency and ex the impact of spinal concepts that your revenue growth be relatively flattish for the year, which relative to your markets obviously suggests is some meaningful share losses.", "Can you help us get our arms around the surgeon base at this point in your core Hip and Knee businesses and any magnitude of surgeon loss, anything you can help us get an insight into whether it's specific territories or specific parts in the business where you are most vulnerable right now and you see yourselves losing more shares as you go into '09?", "David Dvorak", "This is, the issues and root causes are the same ones that we've been describing and I think that they're quite well understood in the various markets globally. So there really isn't a particular geographic segment.", "Now, getting the training and education back up and running, any delayed payments is obviously awfully frustrating and disruptive to the relationships that we have with surgeons that have contributed so much in the development of the products and the assistance in training and educating other surgeons on the proper use of those products.", "Now, we've made tremendous progress, over the course of even just the fourth quarter on both those fronts. So yes, on an account-by-account basis, we feel like we have good visibility into what the additional potential fallout would be.", "But we're also very optimistic that as you get into the second half of the year and some of that disruption anniversaries out; in the form of the lack of training and education from 2008, in the form of the disruption to those surgeon relationships on the collaborative side, in the form of introducing products that are going to fill the gaps that we're currently up against on the Hip side in particular, and then even those field actions on OSP and Durom. We're going to get to the second half of this year and put the business back on a growth track.", "Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities", "One of the things that you're doing is reducing the size of your product development teams. To what degree is taking your product development teams from 15 to 20 surgeons, down to three to five surgeons and the surgeons that are basically no longer on the team. Is that where you're losing your business and those surgeons in particular?", "David Dvorak", "I wouldn't say that it's those surgeons in particular. I think that those types of moves are all in the broader mix of factors that are contributing to the dynamics that we see right now, but those are all incorporated into the plans that we're developing to put things back on track too, Mike.", "Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities", "Okay. Last question. And this is may be a tough question. I get this a lot from investors and obviously your business has gone through a tough '08, you're describing what's going to be arguably even in more difficult 2009. Describe the Board's patience with the strategic plan. I know a lot of people ask how long can this go on with the company, this direction, before the Board gets frustrated. So could you give us any sense of the degree to which the Board is on-board with what you're describing here?", "David Dvorak", "Now we're very confident in what we're going to be able to achieve this year, is the short answer to that. I don't think that 2009 is a year that anyone ought to be pessimistic about. We're telling you what we think the milestones are going to look like and we get to the second half of this year and start seeing some of these headwinds factors anniversary out, when you put the business back on track and exit this year in a very strong fashion.", "Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities", "Okay. Thank you, David.", "David Dvorak", "Yes, you're welcome Mike. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Toung of Argus Research Corporation.", "David Toung - Argus Research Corporation", "Good morning. Thank you for taking the call.", "David Dvorak", "Good morning.", "David Toung - Argus Research Corporation", "Getting down to a little bit deeper into your relationships with the surgeons, since you're acknowledging market share losses, presumably these surgeons are temporarily using your competitor's products. What gives you the confidence that these surgeons will come back to Zimmer and what's the tone of your conversations? I know you said you made a lot of tremendous progress in your relationships, but do surgeons switch back and forth or -- just describe a little bit more on your grass roots conversations?", "David Dvorak", "These conversations are improving as a general matter. That's certainly the case. I mean, I'm not saying that there isn't risk of additional losses, obviously we're projecting out that there in fact will be some additional losses. But it's important to note that our assumptions going forward with growth that's built into the model in the back half for the year don't presume that we're going to be restoring all of those relationships. Many of those relationships will anniversary out.", "Every day, we're developing new relationships with new customers and those are improving our performance and as some of those significant early losses anniversary out, you're going to see the top line growth would be restored as well.", "So as a general matter, the root causes that have led to the disruption are being addressed and it's one of the reasons that we're so optimistic about what's going to transpire as we get deeper into 2009.", "David Toung - Argus Research Corporation", "Since your agreement compliance is mainly in the US, what's been the dynamic in Europe and Asia as far as the market shares and --, because I think your numbers here were across the board below market.", "Jim Crines", "", "Yes, sorry, David, this is Jim. The same programs that are governing decision making and how services are getting provided, and how the company goes about entering into relationships with our bona fide needs. There has been and is in the process of being rolled out to all of our business units and we talked about that in the past.", "It has caused as we said some disruption is not only in the US but outside the US as well as we work towards getting the infrastructure in place, among other things, such that these decisions can be made in an efficient way and the services can be provided in an efficient way, responding to what we believe are bona fide needs in those markets as well.", "David Toung - Argus Research Corporation", "Okay. Great, thank you.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins of Banc of America Securities.", "Bob Hopkins - Banc of America Securities", "Hi, thank you. Good morning, can you hear me?", "David Dvorak", "Good morning.", "Jim Crines", "Good morning, Bob.", "Bob Hopkins - Banc of America Securities", "Just two quick questions. First, just sort of following up on some of the issues that have been touched on previously, when you guys stated last quarter that you lost some physician relationships to competitors in Q3 and that you felt like that would continue in Q4 and obviously it looks like that did happen. But if you just look at the absolute number of physicians that you think went to competitors in Q3 and I'm making up a number, let's say it's 50, did you lose more than 50 this quarter or did you lose less than 50 this quarter? I'm just wondering in terms of absolute numbers, if things get worse this quarter than last?", "", "Jim Crines", "", "I would say, Bob, this is Jim, that it was less. I think some of what is in my view impacting and our view impacting on our results in the fourth quarter is what we believe is a slowdown in procedures across the broader market. I think that will prove itself out as and when all the companies have reported.", "I will say that if you look at the data that we provided on the, our estimates of the market share erosion both in Knees and Hips, it was a bit more pronounced in Knees in the fourth quarter. Maybe lesser so on Hips, relative to what we experienced in the third quarter.", "Bob Hopkins - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. And then just a follow up on Mike's question earlier, talking about the difference between the guidance that was -- the rough guidance, preliminary guidance for '09 that was provided in the third quarter versus this, it's roughly $0.45. I am wondering if you can, can you first try to put that into buckets in terms of what's changed is there -- what are the top two or three things and how much was each one of those things contributing to that $0.40 to $0.45 difference between what you were saying three months ago versus what you are saying today? Thank you.", "David Dvorak", "Well, clearly, our view of the market and how the market's going to grow for 2009 is changed. We've taken down our expectations as we talked about for market growth down to 6% from where, as we said it was recently trending at 8% to 9%. Share loss being a bit more pronounced coming out of the fourth quarter relative to what our expectations were at that time.", "And finally and that really makes up 85% to 90% of that adjustment on the bottom line. The rest of what makes up that adjustment on the bottom line is what we believe is needed in the way of increased spending in the areas that David touched on in order to restore growth in that core franchise and that spending is going to be focused on both product development and medical education programs.", "And then finally, one other thing that I mentioned in my comments was the fact that we are going to be stepping up to a degree our spending on quality systems, as I indicated to achieve the continuous improvement objectives we have laid out in that area.", "Bob Hopkins - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line Tao Levy of Deutsche Bank Securities.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Hey, good morning.", "David Dvorak", "Good morning, Tao.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities", "So you talked a couple times, one of the ways you guys are going to try to stop the share loss is to invest in product development. But as you walked through what you planned to launch in 2009, I think I heard maybe two products. And I didn't know if there was more there that that's coming that's in the pipeline that will come out in 2010. A few years ago there were always some big products that were coming out this year or the following year, whether it was the Gender Knee or some of the hip products.", "So I'm trying to get a better sense of, is there a way, for example, in the knee business where you can the slow down some of the market share losses because it doesn't seem like you're coming out with a knee product and you have one of your competitors, which looks like it may have taken three, four market share points this past quarter.", "David Dvorak", "We're not going to obviously lay out everything that we have in the pipeline. The pipeline is robust, it's diversified across all the different product categories and the launch dates for those products are obviously spread out as well. So, we're trying to do is highlight the things in the short term that don't put us to the competitive disadvantage by tipping our hand but give you some visibility as to things that we think are going to make the most significant impact in the short term. And those, the principal category there is on the Hip side the Acetabular Cup offering that will be launched in the second half of this year.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities", "And on the Knee side, I think you had mentioned instruments. Is that what's going to help you guys you think in '09?", "David Dvorak", "Instruments and there are other plans as well.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay. And the trauma product that you mentioned before, when do you expect to launch that in '09?", "David Dvorak", "That rolls out through the course of the year. Their nails for the different anatomical sites will be rolling out on a quarter-by-quarter basis to largely be completed before the year is out, if not completely out before the year.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Thanks. Okay. And then when you look at and you reflect back on the issues with Durom, is there a way to quantify what type of impact that had on Zimmer's reputation and/or doctor loyalty? Because as I see the claim numbers start to go up, it seems like a high number, I assume most of the Durom patients haven't had or I assume that most of them don't have any problems with the hip.", "So, I was surprised to see the number go up, unless those patients are starting to have problems and the surgeons who implanted the product are getting frustrated. So I think it kind of tie those two together.", "David Dvorak", "I don't think that it is the case that there is frustration that's driving that. The clinical results are what are being used to develop the criteria and make decisions around that. It's tough, I think, to quantify as you've requested the impact there. Obviously, those are situations that we do everything under our power to avoid ever having that kind of disruption for surgeons and patients.", "And so we've done the thing that we think is most responsible under those circumstances and we're standing by our obligations with respect to the patient's needs in these circumstances as well. The direct financial impact is, quite quantifiable in the sense of we explained what we thought would happen revenue-wise and then provided updates on that and now the impact on the product liability side.", "I think that the thing that is important to consider, though, is that it was one of several challenges that we faced in 2008, and so if nothing else, it's time consuming. It drives a lot of energy towards those issues, and as a consequence, it's disruptive from everyone's perspective.", "And so, you have a sales force that is going to be less oriented towards thinking optimistically about the results they can produce with their product line until those types of issues are addressed. And that's why, we have such a great deal of optimism as we enter the second-half of the year and put some products out that we think will address the gaps that we do have on the Acetabular side.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay. And then just my final question. I was surprised to hear, you guys mention that you're going to use most of your excess cash to buy back stock. I was wondering, are there not any sort of interesting opportunities there in your areas, just given the market conditions? Or you might make another acquisition or is sort of stock buy back now at the top of the list of just where you're going to use your cash?", "Jim Crines", "Tao, this is Jim. The focus clearly in 2009 will be on restoring growth in the core franchise and getting the product development programs up and running, so there is a good continuous flow of new product into those markets. Stepping up our investment and efforts in the area of medical education to be able to respond to what we believe are bona fide needs in the US and outside the US", "So again, that really is the focus for the 2009 of our operating plan. And with that, we, just as we've pointed out, built in an assumption that available free cash flow will go principally towards share repurchases over the course of the year.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot.", "Jim Crines", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart of Credit Suisse.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to go back to the hip resurfacing I guess comment that you made earlier, where you said that you would be out without that. Are you discontinuing your current program with Durom and do you have any plans to relaunch any new ones?", "David Dvorak", "The study that was underway, Kristen, has been suspended and that's been the case since the middle of last year. So we will pursue a resurfacing product and we have plans on a couple of different fronts in that regard.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Will it include Durom or it's going to be completely new?", "David Dvorak", "It will likely be a new cup.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then, just going back to the (inaudible) customer versus product related losses. Is there any way to split it out to your loss share with 50% being customer losses versus another 50% being product related issues?", "David Dvorak", "Well, obviously, you're trying to climb inside the minds of the decision maker there and I think it is difficult to disaggregate the two, I think if they're quite interrelated. I will tell you that a significant driver for those losses has been the disruption, as opposed to the product gaps.", "I think we've been pretty specific as to the side of our business, that is the Hip side, that has been most impacted by product gaps. I don't think that the majority of the losses and the slowdown on the Knee side have been product gaps, although there have been elements of that, just far or less significant than Hips.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "And are you surprised in this tightened environment with the DOJ and different investigations that you've seen as many customer losses given the environment?", "David Dvorak", "Well, overall, obviously this is a pretty dynamic period of time. I don't know that anyone could have predicted with absolute certainty going into things a year and half ago, but I think that we have great clarity now as to where things are headed and what kind of a job we can do to drive the restoration of our performance in the sequential quarters in 2009 and where we'll end up as we March into 2010.", "So, I think what's important to us at this point is that understanding and our confidence level to do the right things to put the business back on track as this year progresses.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Just to make sure I understood you. I think you had commented that there was a slowdown across the broader market and as other companies report this will become increasingly evident. We heard from two of the same size kind of competitors talk about them not seeing a slowdown. Is there anything different about your mix of business that would make you more apt to be seeing a slowdown versus others?", "David Dvorak", "I think that anyone's visibility and this is the question that Bruce was posing too, you have views into pockets and there are pockets that have slowed down. There are other pockets that don't seem to be affected by the general economic downturn, but it is the case that when you do the math on the numbers of the companies that have already reported, it's fairly irrefutable that there has been an overall market slowdown, and then you start drawing analysis into and assumptions about how much of that is a unit slowdown.", "And the tough thing I think about coming to a definitive and all-knowing physician on that front is, as I said, all you have is anecdotal information and geographic pockets or accounts that have slowed down, rather than anything that is all that broad based. And you know, look it could be happening at different paces across different geographic locations as well with the economy having gone through what it's gone through and continuing to go through what we're seeing right now.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "", "In the fourth quarter, you felt there was a slowdown in your core business due to the economy?", "David Dvorak", "Yeah, I think that's clear that the market did drop off.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Okay. My last question, then and I know there were many. You had commented also that there was some dilution associated with the Abbott Spine deal within operations. How do you breakout the difference between what you're including in operations versus what you're going to include in this acquisition and integration charges which is I think about $0.13 in earnings that is excluded from the adjusted range?", "David Dvorak", "Yes. What's included in our adjusted results related to Abbott Spine are the sales and operating earnings or losses of that business. What is excluded as you pointed out is the inventory step-up amortization and any significant one-time integration costs as we work towards putting the two businesses and the two organizations together.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "And so the $0.13 for the full year is just one-time related to distributors or what's specifically is $0.13?", "David Dvorak", "A big piece of it is related to the integration of the sales networks around the world.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Okay. I'll drop off. Thanks so much.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company", "Hi, good morning.", "David Dvorak", "Good morning.", "Jim Crines", "Good morning.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company", "Do you feel you are where you need to be in providing visibility to your consultants on the structure of royalty and consultant agreements? And generally speaking do you believe you can make a good case to surgeons that they are not make any less working with you rather than your competitors. And I guess how important has progress in this effort been in attempting to stabilize share?", "David Dvorak", "Yes. I'm absolutely confident of our ability to be able to recruit and engage the very best design talent in the world on our projects. We went through a quite elaborate process with outside help to develop a royalty model that we think is appropriate going forward and competitive within the marketplace.", "That model has been signed off on by the oversight that we're currently receiving with our monitor and others. And I will tell you that we already have been successful at engaging world class teams to move forward projects. So the answer is yes and we've proven it out.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company", "Okay. Thanks for that. It sounds like your long-term strategy to -- try to simplify this a little bit -- in Hips and Knees is based largely on trying to stabilize share loss in 2009 and then getting back to market levels of growth while maybe doing what you've done in the past, which is getting relatively higher mix benefit.", "Assuming this is correct, recognizing that hospital administrators are always trying to control pricing and do their best to limit surgeon discretion. Is there anything you're seeing recently that's different, given the current environment? I'm just trying to get at how you're thinking about the potential for mix benefits longer term?", "David Dvorak", "Our plan is to not only stabilize our Hip and Knee business but as we progress through 2009 and enter 2010 to go back to taking market share, obviously. And that means new accounts, not just mix. I think that mix has already become a bit more challenging and I think it will continue to be so.", "I think that there is going to be greater scrutiny placed on the introduction of new products and one is going to have to prove out in a clinical empirically driven manner that we are creating better patient outcomes taking costs out of the system to be able to get that mix benefit. And our development programs are designed with that aim in mind.", "So yes, I think that mix has already gotten to be more challenging over the last operating period or two and will continue to be the case. So, one is going to have to do a better job in their development efforts to prove out the benefits.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company", "Okay. And last question, you talked about Knee share of loss being relatively more pronounced than Hip share loss in the quarter. Is it right to assume that this is somewhat a function of the fact you that had earlier challenges in the year on the Hip side, both because of the lack of resurfacing and also because of [there are] mid-year. I'm just trying to get at whether the Knees being a little bit worse than Hips, is not necessarily suggesting that Hips are holding up better?", "David Dvorak", "I think that the pacing could be a bit different. Those moves have been a little bit lumpy, obviously beginning in the third quarter and continuing in the fourth quarter. I think that we now have a good understanding as to what we think will occur going forward and what we can do to optimize our performance relating into those risks.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company", "Okay. Thanks for taking the questions.", "David Dvorak", "You're welcome, Doug. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy of Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Good morning. I just have a couple of questions. It's pretty clear you guys are going to be aggressive in spending and trying to stem the share losses you're seeing. But is price a lever you're willing to start to play in order to sort of get business back or even in order to stabilize business at this point?", "David Dvorak", "I don't think our pricing strategy has changed or will change going forward at all, Raj. I mean, the areas that we're going to be concentrating on is getting, innovative products out the door and ramping up our training and education, so that surgeons understand how to use those products in a safe and effective way.", "I'll tell you that, on the training and education front, as those programs ramp up and we get new technologies out, we are seeing successes in the adoption rates of those products. Jim pointed out, a couple of those pockets and so, those are the basics for the business going forward as opposed to price.", "Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. Along those same lines, we're sort of nearing the end of the monitoring period here. The Department of Justice settlement and you guys have unfortunately endured probably a tougher path than your competitors through this time.", "Do you feel the playing field has been leveled here? Is the compliance standard costing across industry at this point or do you feel that you are, that the other orthopedic companies need to maybe come up to where you guys are or will have to overtime?", "David Dvorak", "Well, I think that different competitors are going to go about this at different speeds and in different locations within their geographic segments. I don't know if there's ever going to be a magical day that rolls around, where it's a perfectly level playing field across all geographic segments.", "I will tell you that I think the trends, are all very much in that direction, whether it comes in the form of enforcement or updated codes of ethics, either AdvaMed or [Eucomed] practices that we see are beginning to conform much more consistently with these higher standards. Hospital administrators are driving this. State legislators are driving it, as well as a legislation that's pending at the federal level. So all the trends are very consistent with the decisions that we made.", "And again, what we were doing strategically was ensuring that for our organization we weren't going to incrementalize this process and I think it's really important to note that cultural changes are necessary in these times, and the approach that we took drove a cultural change through the organization.", "There is absolute buy into what we're doing. We're going to get our business back on track and have a healthy environment for this new world that we're going to be operating in and I think it's going to be one of the reasons that we're going to be so successful.", "Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "And then just one last one on the Abbott Spine business, I think you mentioned if I understand that correctly, you did about $22 million in the quarter (inaudible) $88 million or so on an annualized basis. If I'm not mistaken, that business is doing north of $100 million or $110 million when you acquired it. I guess that implies that you've seen some disruption in the distribution. What should we think about is kind of a normalized run rate for the Abbott Spine business now that you guys own it?", "David Dvorak", "Yes, I indicated in my comments, we think about that business on a combined basis and as I said, on a combined basis compared to 2008, we do expect that Spine revenues are going to lag market growth. As a consequence of the synergies that we had built into our model and we fully expected as we put those two sales networks together and, they are major market here in the US and in other markets outside the US.", "Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "But has that disruption in the sales infrastructure in the distributor base, has that been more when you thought it was going to be? Have you lost more salespeople?", "David Dvorak", "I would tell you that $22 million that we saw in the fourth quarter is in line with what we had in our model.", "Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. And then just one last one, broadly on the sales force for the company, in general the sales infrastructure. Is this rough time, have you seen a greater disruption in your sales force? Have you lost people because of what's going on out in the marketplace?", "David Dvorak", "We have not seen any turnover beyond what we have experienced in more normalized times, so the answer is no.", "Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Great. Thank you very much.", "David Dvorak", "Thanks, Raj.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew of William Blair.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "Actually, all my questions have been asked. Thanks.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you, Ben.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Roman of Morgan Stanley.", "David Roman - Morgan Stanley", "Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. Just a couple of things on the guidance. Jim, did you bake in anything on the earnings line for a contribution from share repurchases?", "Jim Crines", "Yes. And if you go back to the transcript, I think you'll see that we actually gave guidance on what our expectations are for the average share count for 2009 at 216 million to 217 million. So that clearly does take into account the effect that the share repurchase program will have that and what we have assumed in the way of interest cost or lower interest income for 2009.", "David Roman - Morgan Stanley", "And can you give us some sense for '09, I know you gave an expectation for free cash flow, but what the outflows will be from surgeon payments for the full year?", "Jim Crines", "Well, as David indicated, we've made very significant progress in the fourth quarter. There are still some payments that remain outstanding and we have in our plans to bring all of those payments up-to-date through the course of 2009.", "Having said that, there are some of these arrangements where the settling out of those payments may be a bit complicated and it's difficult to predict how and when exactly some of them may ultimately settle out. But that is all sort of reflected in the expectations that we laid out regarding cash flow.", "David Roman - Morgan Stanley", "Are you closer to 30% of the way there or 80% of the way there?", "Jim Crines", "I'd say we're closer to 80% of the way there.", "David Roman - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then David, on several occasions now at conferences you've talked about the need to increase investment spending either through research and development or external investments to generate premium price products. Can you maybe talk about, and maybe give us a little more detail behind that thinking and then what Zimmer is doing to address that?", "David Dvorak", "Well, I think that it's clear that we're entering an environment where one is going to have to prove out in an empirical way that products that are being introduced where you're expecting premiums in the way of pricing, that is mix, you're going to have to provide better patient solutions.", "So our R&D efforts and the allocation of our resources are very consistent with that. Obviously, on the extreme end, our biological solutions that would introduce earlier interventions to the disease state for that patient, but there are other material advancements short of biological solution that can be made and we're working on those actively within our current efforts.", "David Roman - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And do you think that 5% to 6% of sales for R&D is sustainable to support those efforts over a longer period of time?", "David Dvorak", "I do. I think that the mix of the R&D spend will change, but I think that that level or roughly that level is probably going to be adequate.", "David Roman - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you, David.", "Paul Blair", "Carey in the interest of our caller's time, let's take one more question, please.", "Operator", "Your final question will come from the line of Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, this is Matt for Joanne. Can you hear me?", "David Dvorak", "Yes.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This was touched on, but could I just delve into the sales force a little bit more. You talked about the synergies at Abbott, some turnover in dental. In the past you've talked about some disruption in the focus of your Hip and Knee guys.", "Could you just expand on those ideas a little bit more and tell us a little bit more about the turnover in dental and what the synergies are? And how you're getting the Hip and Knee guys back on track and what their current sort of feeling is about the business?", "David Dvorak", "Sure. Let me start with dental because it's a bit more discrete, obviously. I think that we explained probably in prior conference calls when asked the question about sales force stability, that we weren't seeing any changes other than in dental and some quarters back we did see excessive turnover in dental. That has now stabilized.", "I don't think that currently we're seeing anything beyond what would be a normal turnover level, so I think that that situation has been remedied and the sales force is stabilized there.", "The Abbott Spine side of things, I don't know that we have a lot more color to add there, Matt. Obviously, one of the key strategic assets that we were picking up through that acquisition was in enhanced channel, and so we went through a very deliberate process over the course of the fourth quarter to determine which distributors we were going to continue on with and which geographic segments and ended up integrating the best of each into our go-forward distribution channel which we feel is a very strong one.", "Obviously, in sheer size, there's a lot more critical mass in those distributorships as you layer on top the Abbott Spine revenues, and so it's one of the strategic areas that we were after in that deal. I think that that promise is going to be realized and has already been solidified in the go-forward distribution group that's been put together there. And so it is a combination of legacy Zimmer and legacy Abbott Spine folks that have been assembled.", "On the Hip and Knee side of things, look, we went through a year where there was pretty significant disruption due to the implementation of our enhanced compliance program. We slowed down for periods of time, training and education and then went through a lot of content development and process development as well, to be able to get that ramp back up.", "Those activities have progressed to a large extent and I would say now in certain geographic segments, we're ironing out the final wrinkles that will be necessary to go full bore and I would expect in all geographic segment to have things up and running completely by the end of the first half of this year, but some geographic segment are ahead of others.", "You layer on top of that disruption though, the justifiable frustration among some of the surgeons that we had collaborated with in the past. We are doing a better job in providing clarity in our communications with how their issues will be resolved.", "As Jim said, we are better than three-quarters of the way there. I think by any measurements, whether it's on the royalty side or the general consulting side, so that helps in those relationships as well.", "And then as we move forward and get past OSP, Durom and then some of the other product gaps that we have already talked a lot about on this call, I think that all of those things allow a sales force to get reoriented on going to the offensive side and that's just what we're planning to do in 2009.", "So, again one of the reasons that we are very optimistic about the progress that we are going to make with this business over the course of this year.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you very much.", "David Dvorak", "You're welcome, Matt. Thank you. And let me say thanks again to everyone for joining us today and for your continued interest in Zimmer. We look forward to speaking to you on our first quarter conference call on Thursday, April 23rd at 8:00 o'clock.", "With that, I'll now turn the call back to you, Carey.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Zimmer First Quarter 2009 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions). Thank you.", "Mr. Paul Blair, you may begin your conference.", "Paul Blair", "Good morning, I am Paul Blair, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zimmer. Joining me today to host this call are David Dvorak, President and Chief Executive Officer and Jim Crines, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, we will review our performance for the first quarter of 2009, provide you with an update on certain key matters, present an update on our outlook for 2009 and conclude our discussion with a question-and-answer session. We have shortened our prepared remarks in order to take your questions and complete the call within an hour.", "Before we get started, I would like to point out that this presentation contains forward-looking statements within the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the orthopedics industry, management's beliefs, and assumptions made by management.", "These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.", "For a list and description of the risks and uncertainties, see the disclosure materials filed by Zimmer with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Zimmer disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.", "This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of such information to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, along with other financial and statistical information for the periods to be presented on this conference call, was included in the press release announcing our earnings, which may be accessed from the Zimmer website at www.zimmer.com under the section entitled Investor Relations.", "A rebroadcast of this call will be available from approximately two hours following the conclusion of today's call through the end of the day on May 7th, 2009 and can also be accessed from the Investor Relations section of the Zimmer website.", "At this time, I would like to introduce David Dvorak, President and Chief Executive Officer of Zimmer.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you, Paul, and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today to talk about Zimmer\u2019s first quarter results and how we are positioning the company to deliver value to healthcare providers, their patients, and our stockholders.", "I\u2019ll start by briefly reviewing the first quarter results, which Jim will discuss in more detail in a few moments. Then we\u2019ll take a look at the expectations for the year. As a quick preview of this part of my remarks, we are reaffirming the full-year outlook that was provided on our last conference call. I\u2019ll complete my prepared remarks with an overview of some of the areas we are focused on in 2009 and why we are confident that Zimmer is well positioned to deliver solid returns and achieve long-term success.", "Consolidated sales for the first quarter of $993 million were down 1.5% in constant currency from the prior year first quarter and down 6.3% reported. Consistent with prior quarter trends, the U.S. dollar remains strong throughout the first quarter, which led to a currency translation effect of negative 4.8% on sales in the quarter.", "As we\u2019ve discussed before, the top line impact of currency fluctuations is largely neutralized on the bottom line due to our hedging program. In constant currency, Knee revenues were essentially flat in the first quarter, while Hip revenues declined 3.7%. Among our other product franchises, extremities revenue were up 7.8%, trauma sales increased 5.5%, Spine was up 23.7% inclusive of the Abbott Spine revenues and Dental was down 10.6%. Finally, our orthopedic surgical product sales were down 19% in the first quarter due in large part to the continuing impact of the 2008 suspension of product distribution.", "Turning to our bottom line results, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.95, a decrease of 8.7% compared with the prior year and slightly ahead of the consensus estimates for the quarter. During the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $185 million.", "Our first quarter performance is a manifestation of the challenges we faced in 2008 and in part, the carryover effect of previously disclosed share losses and core product franchises. With respect to market growth rates, we continue to expect demand for procedures to slow this year by about 2 percentage points worldwide due to the general economic downturn. We also believe however that the market\u2019s deceleration in product procedure demand is likely to be temporary as the benefits of Knee and Hip procedures are indisputable for prospective patients who are suffering the debilitating effects of osteoarthritis.", "Looking at the balance of the year, we are reaffirming our sales and earnings guidance. As we previously stated, our results are expected to improve in comparison to our prior year performance as the year progresses and we anniversary out of the negative effects of 2008 customer losses and the impact of certain product suspensions. We continue to expect revenues for 2009 to increase between 1% and 3% on a constant currency basis and full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $3.85 to $4.", "2009 is a pivotal year for Zimmer. At the end of March, we announced that the deferred prosecution agreement with United States Attorney's Office had expired to schedule. Thanks to the tireless efforts of the Zimmer team, our enhanced business model is in place worldwide. Key product development programs are underway and we have now resolved most of our surgeon payment issues.", "More fundamentally, we have structures in place to maintain essential collaborative relationships while managing potential conflicts of interest. We are concentrating on executing initiatives commenced last year that will help drive and support growth. Recent investments in infrastructure, additional management talent, enhanced medical education, and new products offer expanded opportunities for Zimmer. We believe that we have the tools to leverage our worldwide leadership in Knees and Hips across the muscular-skeletal spectrum.", "Those sound like lofty goals. Let me give you some examples of why we believe we are beginning to reestablish positive momentum in our business. We\u2019ll start with medical education, which was largely suspended over one year ago. The interruption had an impact on our ability to respond fully to the interest in the marketplace for our products, particularly for healthcare professionals who want training on our new products, instrumentation and techniques.", "There is no doubt that training and education play a critical role in facilitating positive clinical results for surgeons. We are addressing the impact of this interruption with two key programs. One is our new medical education program, which has been redesigned to optimize knowledge transfer.", "Secondly, we have broadened our roster of learning opportunities to better match surgeons\u2019 individual needs and schedules. In the United States, our bio skills training courses are filling quickly, often as soon as our course schedules are announced and the courses are being conducted at or even above historic levels. We will be expanding this program as 2009 progresses to accommodate demand. Training in Europe and Asia-Pacific is now back up and running as well.", "We are also focused on expanding our training on important new products like our Trabecular Metal Reverse Shoulder, our M/L Taper with connective technology, and Fitmore stems, as well as our advanced Knee products like the Zimmer Patello-femoral Joint and LPS-Flex Mobile system. At the same time, we are developing training for products that we plan to launch in 2009 such as our new Natural Nail for trauma, patient-specific instruments for Knees, and new Acetabular Cup offerings for Hips.", "We are also continuing to make progress with the re-launch of the orthopedic surgical products that we voluntarily seized to distribute in 2008. Moreover, we continue to make significant investments in quality initiatives including programs to apply consistent standards across the company to ensure the quality is firmly embedded in the DNA of our corporate culture.", "With respect to external development, we are extending our reach in Spine with last year\u2019s acquisition of the Abbott Spine business. While we are currently working through some disruption in our Spine sales as we integrate the two organizations, going forward we look for improved sales performance in Spine as the strength in distribution channel leverages a broader product offering.", "Finally, we are excited about the level of interest shown in Zimmer and our products by attendees of the AAOS Annual Meeting in February. Zimmer\u2019s booth was one of the most active and well-attended at the meeting according independent sources and there was a great deal of positive surgeon interaction. We are relishing the chance to get back to driving our business forward and our experience at AAOS is one reflection of how this is happening at Zimmer.", "Overall, we are in a far better position to take advantage of opportunities now than we were a year ago. We have great confidence in Zimmer\u2019s long-term future and are determined to handle near-term challenges by keeping patience at the forefront as we focus on customers and results.", "Jim will now provide further details on the quarter and our guidance. Jim?", "Jim Crines", "Thanks, David. I will review our performance in the quarter in more detail and then provide some additional information related to our guidance. Sales of $993 million for the quarter reflects a decrease of 1.5% in constant currency and 6.3% reported as David indicated. These results reflect anticipated headwinds from 2008 customer losses and the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on translated foreign currency revenues, as well as lower Dental and OSP sales compared to the same quarter last year, partially offset by increased sales in Spine as a result of the Abbot Spine acquisition.", "As a consequence of the stronger U.S. dollar compared with the prior year, foreign currency translation again decreased revenue by 4.8% or $51 million in the quarter. Consolidated pricing was down 0.7% for the quarter, in the Americas price was negative 0.3% for the quarter, while Europe average selling prices were flat compared to the prior year. Asia-Pacific results include negative price of 3.4%, in line with the last three quarters following reimbursement price cuts in Japan, which took effect in April of 2008 and to a lesser degree, cuts in Australia beginning from July of 2008.", "Turning to our first quarter revenue growth by major product category, worldwide reconstructive sales, which now exclude Dental, decreased 1.4% in constant currency and 6.6% reported. Knee sales in the first quarter declined 0.3% in constant currency, reflecting negative price of 1.2%, offset by positive volume and mix of 0.9%.", "As we reported on our fourth quarter call, during the second half of 2008, we had lost an estimated 1.5 points of market share in Knee as a result of various factors including the implementation of our enhanced global compliance program. During the first quarter of this year, based on competitive results reported to date and independent analyst estimates by other market participants, we estimate that our results reflect signs of improving stability in our Knee franchise with a loss of no more than 10 basis points of additional market share in the quarter.", "In the first quarter, Knee sales in constant currency decreased 0.7% in the Americas and increased 1.8% in Europe. In the Americas, price was 0.5 point negative, while volume and mix was essentially flat. The Americas results reflect the carryover effect of 2008 customer losses, as well as some deceleration in procedure volumes in the quarter. Our Europe results reflect positive performance in a market, which appears to be growing in a somewhat lower rate than in the prior year.", "In Asia-Pacific, we are up against \u2013 we were up against a challenging comp in the first quarter. In 2008, our Knee franchise in Asia-Pacific grew 12.3% in constant currency in the first quarter with volume and mix in double digits and slightly positive price. In 2009, volume and mix growth in Asia-Pacific is a more modest 3% and is offset by negative price of 5.7%, resulting in negative growth of 2.7% for the quarter.", "Worldwide Hip sales declined 3.7% in the quarter in constant currency, reflecting negative price of 1.5% and negative volume and mix of 2.2%. We estimate the cumulative share loss in Hips to be in line with the 2 to 2.5 points anticipated in our guidance and reported on our last conference call.", "We continue to focus on opportunities to introduce recently launched products to potential new users including our M/L Taper with connective technology and our Fitmore bone conserving stems, again as David indicated. Those efforts are backed by medical education program that has been enhanced to better response the needs for training and education on the safe and effective use of these new devices.", "On the geographic basis and constant currency, first quarter Hip sales decreased 3.4% in the Americas, 2.8% in Europe, and 7.1% in Asia-Pacific. In the Americas, price in Hips was down 1.2%, while volume and mix was down 2.2%. In Europe, the price declined 0.7% and volume and mix was off by 2.1%.", "In Asia-Pacific, reimbursement price cuts in Japan which took effect again in April 2008, led to negative price in Hips of 4% for the region, while volume and mix was down 3.1%. We continued to focus significant product development and resources on addressing gaps in our Hip product offerings, so that we can more effectively counter competitive pressures on our Hip franchise.", "Extremity sales for the quarter in constant currency increased 7.8% over the first quarter of 2008. Dental sales on a constant currency basis decreased 10.6% for the quarter. Dental sales continued to experience pressure on a global due to the weak global economy. We continue to believe that Dental Implant business has attractive long-term growth prospects and is good strategic fit for Zimmer.", "Trauma sales in the quarter were up over the prior year period 5.5% constant currency. On a constant currency basis, trauma sales in the quarter decreased 1.5% in the Americas, increased 18% in Europe, and increased 14% in Asia-Pacific.", "Zimmer Spine reported 23.7% constant currency growth in the quarter. This growth is driven by the Abbott Spine acquisition, which was completed during the fourth quarter of 2008 and contributed $19.8 million of incremental Spine sales in the quarter.", "Finally, Orthopedic Surgical Products and other sales declined 18.6% constant currency in the quarter as a result of the previously announced voluntary suspension in sales of certain patient care products, partially offset by bone, cement, and accessories sales which grew over prior year. The remediation efforts at our Dover, Ohio facility continued to progress and production and distribution of the vast majority of the OSP products has resumed.", "I'll focus now on the rest of the income statements. Our adjusted gross profit margin of 77.2% for the quarter is up 120 basis points from the prior year first quarter.

Your first question comes from Tao Levy with Deutsche Bank.", "Tao Levy \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hi, good morning.", "David Dvorak", "Good morning, Tao.", "James Crines", "Hi Tao.", "Tao Levy \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "So just simply if you look at the overall market and thanks for all the data you guys have provided. If you look at the volumes mid-single digits and again when you look at pricing for you guys, it seems like maybe it was down a little bit more than what we heard from competitors. Given that backdrop, what are you looking for pricing going forward and also with the volume specifically in the second quarter, are you seeing any trends now that make you feel better about where that 5% was in Q1 or maybe a little bit worse and then you\u2019re thinking more that recovery into the 6% takes place in the second half of the year? Thanks.", "James Crines", "Yes, Tao, this is Jim. Just on pricing, I\u2019d say where we are on pricing is really pretty consistent with what we saw in the back half of last year. And as I indicated in my comments, we see that the opportunity for that to improve for us certainly going into the balance of the year given the \u2013 that we anniversary out of the reimbursement price cuts in the Asia-Pacific region that took place in April of 2008.", "So we understand and we would acknowledge that it\u2019s certainly a challenging environment on the pricing front, but it has been for the past couple of years, those conversations really haven\u2019t changed and you\u2019re seeing the effect of what\u2019s happening in the field and what we are reporting over the past several quarters.", "And then I would tell you with respect to the overall growth in the market, it\u2019s pretty much in line what we anticipated coming into the year notwithstanding the fact that maybe a bit more deceleration in Knee procedure growth in the fourth \u2013 in the first quarter.", "But as we look at mix and volume opportunities over the balance of the year as we said \u2013 as I said in my comments, we do believe that the \u2013 the market is likely to grow in 2009 at that sort of 6% level as the procedure comps get a little easier in the back of the year and those price comps get easier in the balance of the year. Mixed opportunities we think in our particular case improve as we go into the balance of the year and we\u2019ll have these medical education programs up and running at full tilt.", "David Dvorak", "Tao, Just \u2013 I know that you asked questions that were framed out with a shorter-term interest in volumes, but every time we talk about the procedures we ought to come back to reiterating that if anything this is short term, these are deferrals, the need for these Knees and Hips is not going away. These patients are going to find other solutions in that interim and if anything it could lead to a bolus of procedures on the back end as the economy begins to recover. So there is no long-term change in our view of the prospects of this market.", "Tao Levy \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "And in terms of \u2013 in Q4 you talked about losses of some of your surgeons, how is that transition from Q4 into Q1 and kind of what you\u2019re looking for in terms of the balance of \u201909?", "David Dvorak", "Yes it\u2019s very much in line with what we had reflected in our guidance, actually it\u2019s better than what we had balance reflected to the extent. We talked about our guidance incorporating risk of up to an additional 50 basis point of share loss in both Hips and Knees. But in Knees, as we look at the first quarter results at this point, I would tell you we \u2013 our estimate is that we\u2019ve lost no more than an additional 10 basis points of market share in the quarter on top of the 1.5 points loss of market share that we experienced in the back half of last year.", "Tao Levy \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Actually I was talking referring more to actual surgeon defections that you commented in Q4 about surgeons who were had left the Zimmer family and I was just wondering if you can comment on how that trend has looked?", "David Dvorak", "Yes and that trend is stabilizing is the answer. And I think Jim is quantifying that, but \u2013", "Tao Levy \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Market share?", "David Dvorak", "Yes. In any of the subjective measures, I would tell you that that trend is stabilizing as well. And on the things that we pointed out last year Tao are the right things for us to have been focused on. We brought in enhanced leadership in that area, our communications are much, much more proactive.", "We\u2019re cleaning up some of the past issues with respect to deferred payments that were owed to those surgeons as well programs are back up and running. So, the general telling and I mentioned it in my comments as well as evidenced by the activity at the AAOS Event in Las Vegas was very positive. So, I think all those trends are positive for us.", "Tao Levy \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Great, thanks a lot.", "David Dvorak", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.", "David Dvorak", "Good morning, Mike.", "Mike Weinstein \u2013 JPMorgan", "Can you hear me okay?", "David Dvorak", "We can.", "Mike Weinstein \u2013 JPMorgan", "Perfect. Thanks for taking my question. Couple of comments or questions here. So \u2013 if you could just spend some time on the inventory build you have over years, what\u2019s the inventory on hand now, if you could help us understand the time period you think it will take to work that down and what should be the appropriate level at the company? And then on the pricing dynamics, which Tao touched on, but it looks like your pricing in the Americas got a little bit more challenging. Can you give us your thoughts on price and not mix as we go forward? Thanks.", "Jim Crines", "Okay. On the inventory build Mike, the focus there on the one hand will continue to be to fully support any new product launches that we have planned for 2009, some of what you\u2019re seeing in the first quarter as an example is \u2013 there is an investment in the inventory of \u2013 associated with the new Natural Nails, the new line of Intramedullary Nails that are going to be launched within that trauma franchise.", "We have an opportunity over the balance of the year to reduce inventory days on our standard volume products after having made some significant investment in 2008, and putting more inventory out in the field as we were working our way through this transition to put our distributors in a position to ease some of the burden, some of the pain they were experiencing in managing, getting the inventory in and out of hospitals on a day-to-day basis. We have targets in mind here in terms of what we are looking for and be able to provide updates on a quarterly basis on these calls as to where we stand relative to those targets.", "David Dvorak", "Yes, and with respect to pricing Mike, I don\u2019t know the general dynamics in those discussions and negotiations have changed much over the last couple of operating periods. It is true that within the U.S. that trend has turned a bit and I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s anything that we expect to become more profound in the go-forward periods and one has to also keep in mind that on the other hand, the European pricing environment has stabilized relative to where it\u2019s been for the last operating period or two and the Asia-Pacific difficulties begin to anniversary out this quarter in Japan and then next quarter in Australia for us.", "So again, our overall assumptions in the guidance that we provided embed those expectations in and I think that we are seeing to date is consistent with what we assumed in the model.", "Mike Weinstein \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. And the last question is just relative to Dave, what you\u2019re thinking about market. Our math with you guys reported this morning shows market growth constant currency in Hips and Knees, pretty equivalent in the first quarter, both in the range of 4%, 4.5%. So is your thinking that market growth improves from here to get to that 6% for the year or share with us your thoughts, I think it will come out a bit lower than you are?", "David Dvorak", "Yes, I don\u2019t think that we are going to see a greater decline in the procedure rate. I think that that will stabilize and improve as the year progresses. And then I think also when you roll up those numbers in their entirety if it\u2019s just on dollars and as Jim referenced in his comments, we start to see the anniversary out of some of that pricing.", "Mike Weinstein \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. I will let someone else jump in here. Thanks.", "David Dvorak", "Thanks Mike.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bruce Nudell with UBS.", "Bruce Nudell \u2013 UBS", "Thank you. Yes, our calculations similar to Mike\u2019s show about a 4.5% market. And so that\u2019s like a 2.5% or 3.5% shortfall depending upon whether you think the market would be have been 7% or 8%. How much of that do you think is volume shortfall as opposed to the inability to improve ASPs at standard 2% to 3% levels? So, of the 2.5% to 3.5%, how much do you think was basically volume in terms of shortfall?", "Jim Crines", "Bruce, this is Jim. We can\u2019t speak for obviously what\u2019s reflected in our competitors\u2019 numbers. We \u2013 I can tell you with respect to our own performance, the difference really is in procedure demand. What we are seeing in terms of mixed benefit is consistent with what we saw coming out of the fourth quarter of last year, pricing is consistent with what we saw coming out of the first \u2013 there in the fourth quarter of last year. And so the difference really is in procedure demand, at least with respect to our numbers. And again, I can\u2019t speak to whether or not that\u2019s also the case obviously with respect to competitor results.", "Bruce Nudell \u2013 UBS", "Okay. So, you think that it\u2019s not inconceivable to you that volumes across the market could be down 2.5% let\u2019s say?", "Jim Crines", "Yes.", "David Dvorak", "I\u2019m not sure why our experience would be different than the broader market with the market share that we have. And I will tell you that our intelligence and field checks on this are relatively consistent with that. So, I don\u2019t think that there is a material difference between what we are experiencing and what the others are experiencing in that regard.", "Bruce Nudell \u2013 UBS", "And with regard to that, we haven\u2019t really hit peak unemployment yet. Kind of what gives you the confidence that we\u2019ve kind of seen the worst of the slowdown?", "David Dvorak", "Well, I don\u2019t \u2013 I just think that when you have sort of behavior modification incentives that cut in different directions, there are people that want to accelerate these procedures because they\u2019re afraid that they\u2019re going to lose their employment opportunities and potentially their insurance coverage, right? And then you have others that want to defer it, because they\u2019re afraid to being out of work at this point in time is not a good idea and that their job security and stability isn\u2019t what they would like it to be.", "So, I just think that it\u2019s tough to use that unemployment rate necessarily as a leading indicator for what these procedures will do. But the trends that we saw in the fourth quarter and that we saw in the first quarter would indicate that we are going to be stabilizing this as the year progresses. And if we are off by a bit in that regard, I would tell you that our own guidance that we provided would assume a bit of a margin of error in that number and of course would be countered by other things that are assumed into those models. So, irrespective of that, we are comfortable with our guidance at this point.", "Bruce Nudell \u2013 UBS", "Terrific. And my final question is, it looks like sequentially you may \u2013 I know there is seasonality in your share in the various geographies, but it looks like in Hips and Knees in the U.S., you actually may have stepped up slightly sequentially with a little bit of erosion ex-U.S. Is that correct? And in aggregate, how much more share globally do you expect to see this year?", "David Dvorak", "Well, I think that you saw greater stability in our European business than you did in the U.S. business, but the beginnings of stability on the U.S. business show positive trend in that regard.", "Bruce Nudell \u2013 UBS", "Thank you.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you, Bruce.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matthew Dodds with Citigroup.", "Matthew Dodds \u2013 Citigroup", "Thanks and good morning. Couple of questions.", "David Dvorak", "Good morning.", "Matthew Dodds \u2013 Citigroup", "First on the surgeon defections, have you seen any comeback potentially a buyer\u2019s remorsement went somewhere else and have since come back to you? That\u2019s one. And then two, on the manufacturing, just to Tao and Mike\u2019s question, so this was really a one-quarter phenomenon where you knew that the volumes would be \u2013 come in lower, but you wanted to build the inventory and now we\u2019re ratcheting down the manufacturing for the rest of the year at a relatively steady clip the next three quarters?", "David Dvorak", "Yes, with respect to the surgeons, I think that what we\u2019ve seen there have rather been anything significant in the way of surgeons returning is just a stabilization on that side, Matthew. And there have been instances where some business has returned, but at this point in time, I wouldn\u2019t describe that as at all material to the overall trend. I think that there have been more instances where conversations have opened back up and so that\u2019s a good sign and there is potential for some of that business to come back. But our assumption is that those returns in this year are going to be relatively modest.", "Jim Crines", "Yes. Matt, this is Jim. The manufacturing slowdown really started to take effect in the back half of last year as we experienced the share loss that we\u2019ve reported out. So it is something that has been reflected in our plans coming into 2009, it\u2019s something that is reflected in the guidance that we provided for 2009, and because we are not providing quarterly guidance, it\u2019s just not something that we had spiked out.", "It does nonetheless cause some sort of volatility in those quarterly gross profit margins because if you slowdown those production facilities, put less volume through them, you have higher unit cost, that inventory is getting put to the shelf and then it gets sold through in subsequent quarters. And that\u2019s what\u2019s causing the margin to begin to step down in the second quarter of this year and as I indicated that\u2019s the trend that will continue through the balance of the year.", "Matthew Dodds \u2013 Citigroup", "Right. But Jim, the gross margin guidance you gave beginning of the year, that range still is okay?", "Jim Crines", "Yes.", "Matthew Dodds \u2013 Citigroup", "All right. Thanks Jim. Thanks David.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.", "Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Yes, thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me okay?", "David Dvorak", "We can Matt. Good morning.", "Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Good morning. So, not to beat the dead horse here in the market and in your (inaudible) so far, I guess I\u2019m looking at this since we are kind of going quarter-to-quarter on trends and then procedure trends and demand and the consumer environment and how it might be affecting this business. Looking at sort of quarter-to-quarter deceleration that we\u2019ve seen across the rest of the group, it\u2019s been about 2% to \u2013 as you\u2019ve talked about, I think 2% to 3% from the other major players and you guys actually came in a little bit better than that in terms of maybe only about a percentage point worldwide recon deceleration, is that \u2013 I guess is it fair to think about not only stabilization in the U.S. in terms of the share losses, but are there any geographies where you\u2019re actually picking up share?", "David Dvorak", "I guess the way we would characterize it Matt, is clearly stable as \u2013 we see the share situation stabilizing, particularly in the Knee franchise in the U.S. and Europe for sure. Talked about very challenging comps we had in Asia-Pacific indicated the volume mix growth in Asia-Pacific for Knees for us, came in around 3% for the quarter.", "It maybe the case, can\u2019t say for sure that the market in Asia-Pacific for Knees, they\u2019ve grown a little bit higher than 3% if it did, our results would reflect maybe some modest additional share loss in Asia-Pacific region within the quarter. That\u2019s something that we\u2019re addressing with substantial amount of effort that\u2019s going into getting the training and education programs back up and running in that part of the world. Again, the way that we think about it that things have really \u2013 our results for the first quarter indicates that things have really stabilized with respect to share.", "Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay. And then just a follow-on, I have a couple here on your smaller businesses, but on your training programs, interactions with surgeons, and your global compliance program, I guess I was a little concerned heading into the beginning of the year outside the U.S. as you rolled out the global compliance that that might start to have follow-on share impacts like we\u2019ve seen in the U.S. It doesn\u2019t seem like it was as bad as we were expecting and do you think we are on the other side of that now or is that still in front of us, do we still have more risk in front of us in global compliance or is it sort of stable and upside from here in terms of the impact of that program?", "David Dvorak", "I think that it will stabilize from where we are. Frankly, our training and education programs are staying up at a rate that causes \u2013 you could be correct in your characterization if there is a bit of a lag outside the U.S. I would also tell you that I think that the deficit in backlog of meeting those needs wasn\u2019t as profound overseas as it has become in the United States.", "So we\u2019re really at what I would characterize to be a fairly full clip now in the U.S. and I would suspect that as the second quarter progresses, I would be able to characterize the OUS training and education similarly, but I just think that they\u2019re working out at a little bit less of a whole than what we have in the U.S. in that regard.", "Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay. Quick one here on Spine and Dental. Spine, by my math looked like excluding the Abbott impact you did something like a mid-teens number in Spine, which is nicely above where the market is and just wondering if you could add any color on kind of whether it\u2019s products or geographies or synergies of the Abbott or what might be \u2013 what might be helping that business to do better than it has in the last year or so?", "David Dvorak", "Yes, that \u2013 the \u2013 if you look at the pro forma numbers Matt, Spine actually went the other way in that quarter. And I will tell you that the legacy Zimmer business has seen more competitive pressures in certain product lines, as well as the fact that we\u2019re going to go through and face some de-synergies on both sides of the equation, the Abbott and the legacy Zimmer side, until those distribution channels are fully cross-trained on the products. So, what you see there is all positive growth by virtue of the acquired revenue. Going forward, as that distribution channel comes together and our training efforts on the sales force side begin to find some traction, we should see some accelerated growth rates as the year progresses.", "Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay. So, it\u2019s still slower than the market in Spine.", "David Dvorak", "That\u2019s right.", "Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "And then last one here on Dental. You mentioned you continue to look at that as an important strategic business for Zimmer. Any \u2013 given your financial wherewithal and the environment that we are in, any interest strategically in adding to your franchise in that business \u2013 in that market?", "David Dvorak", "It\u2019s an area that we would consider on the business development front and we stated that in the past I think that that area would be more geographic footprint oriented as far as our interest goes than anything else. But it continues to be a business and a market that we think is strategically sound and consistent with our mission as a company.", "Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Great. Well, thanks for taking the questions.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you.", "Jim Crines", "Thanks Matt.", "David Dvorak", "Thanks Matt.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Banc of America-Merrill Lynch.", "Bob Hopkins \u2013 Banc of America-Merrill Lynch", "All right, thanks. Can you hear me okay?", "David Dvorak", "We can Bob, good morning.", "Bob Hopkins \u2013 Banc of America-Merrill Lynch", "Great, good morning. There are a couple of quick ones and then one big picture one. What was it in the Spine pro forma growth in the quarter by your math?", "Jim Crines", "It was down about mid-teen.", "Bob Hopkins \u2013 Banc of America-Merrill Lynch", "Down mid-teens pro forma for the deal? Okay. And then, Jim, you mentioned that you thought you lost roughly 10 basis points incrementally in Knees and I didn\u2019t catch what that same number was for Hips.", "Jim Crines", "About two-tenths of a point.", "Bob Hopkins \u2013 Banc of America-Merrill Lynch", "Two-tenths of a point? Okay. And then next little one is again you are forecasting 6% growth for the overall market. Just from a stress test perspective if you will, how low can that market rate grow before your earnings projections become at risk in your view?", "Jim Crines", "Well, Bob as David pointed out, we\u2019re very comfortable with the guidance, particularly given where we are in the share issue. We talked about our guidance incorporating risk on Hips and Knees, additional share loss of up to 50 basis points for the year and clearly looking at the first quarter, we are well below that. So with that and with \u2013 and particularly with the comps getting a bit easier, the \u2013 I mean, as we get into the back half of the year, the training and education programs getting back up and running and having opportunity to increase penetration with these new products.", "Bob Hopkins \u2013 Banc of America-Merrill Lynch", "Right. No, I \u2013?", "Jim Crines", "That growth rate could decelerate, could remain \u2013 I guess the best way to answer the question, it could remain at the first quarter levels and we would still be comfortable with our guidance.", "Bob Hopkins \u2013 Banc of America-Merrill Lynch", "Okay. So, somewhere \u2013 I agree with the previous math, they were somewhere between 4% and 4.5% this quarter. So as long as we don\u2019t go much below that I guess to put words in your mouth, you still feel comfortable with the guidance.", "Jim Crines", "I would agree with that.", "Bob Hopkins \u2013 Banc of America-Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then lastly, just to play devil\u2019s advocate a little bit on the pricing questions that have been asked, I\u2019m just curious David, if you can talk to why shouldn\u2019t we see pricing get worse in Hips and Knees? You\u2019ve got sort of an unprecedented economy and pressure on hospitals, you\u2019ve got physician relationships that have been altered as a result of the DOJ relationships, you\u2019ve got other markets in cardiovascular where pricing is down anywhere from 3% to 10% depending on the categories. I\u2019m just curious I hear your comments about we\u2019re not seeing any change right now, but I\u2019m just curious as to what sort of gives you the confidence that we won\u2019t see incremental pricing pressure as we go forward.", "David Dvorak", "Well, I think that some of those dynamics have existed, they maybe more profound now, Bob, than what they were in prior periods, but the discussions and telling that those discussions take and the relative positions of the players in those discussions, I don\u2019t has to change that profoundly at this point in time.", "If you\u2019re asking if there is something more significant that comes from healthcare reform that could change those dynamics, sure, that\u2019s always a possibility and the proposals that are out there now are so bit that is so big that it\u2019s difficult to even speculate about that. But even in that environment, we have different pricing environments throughout the globe and our go-to-market strategies are different throughout the globe as a consequence of that. Notwithstanding those environmental factors we have very profitable businesses as well.", "Bob Hopkins \u2013 Banc of America-Merrill Lynch", "Okay. So, I\u2019ll talk about it further offline, I guess. So just lastly on OSP, when do you expect a more pronounced rebound there?", "David Dvorak", "Well, you should see a more pronounced rebound beginning in the second quarter, because obviously we have anniversaried out of that suspension at this point in time. By the end of this quarter, we would expect to have most all of those products back in the marketplace.", "Now, recovering those sales is going to take time, but the positive trend should really begin in the second quarter. A little bit of an offset exists obviously because we do have a bit of a capital equipment component, not all that much, probably mid-teens as a percentage within that business and so, obviously that\u2019s a little bit that dragged on through the economic period that we are in right now, but the answer is in the second quarter, Bob.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Raj Denhoy with Thomas Weisel.", "Raj Denhoy \u2013 Thomas Weisel", "Thanks. I wonder if could ask a little bit more on the Spine business. I mean, if we do the math I think much like you guys, it was down roughly 17% to core business in the quarter and I think even the Abbott Spine business, given your comments from last quarter, deteriorated from I think $22 million to just below $20 million this quarter. I think your comments sounded like you expected some resumption of growth at least for some stability and I\u2019m curious why you think that\u2019s going to happen, we are only two quarters into this acquisition. Are we looking at another couple of quarters of the synergies here before we see it turn or do you have plans for a faster turn than that?", "David Dvorak", "Let me answer that answer sort of on two different fronts, Raj. I think that talking about the legacy Zimmer business, there are some competitive pressures, our Dynesys System is one of the areas obviously with competitive offerings being introduced. There is some pressure on that business. Trying to work through some of the reimbursement issues that relate to that product present other challenges and so, that some of what you\u2019re seeing. But also on the second front while combining these independent distributor networks and choosing the strongest distributor in each of those geographies and as a consequence of that process, you are going to lose some historic revenues on both sides of that equation.", "So, that\u2019s happening, you really are at a point where those decisions have been made, our distribution channel within United States has been fully formed. So, all of the disadvantages of going through that selection process are embedded in the first quarter results. None of the advantages of that stronger channel and a broader product offering are being seen. So, from here we should start to see a very natural progression towards improved performance. How profound that will be in the second quarter, we are not going to give that kind of specific guidance, but we ought to be able to methodically work towards improved performance from where we are now.", "Raj Denhoy \u2013 Thomas Weisel", "So the $65 million in the first quarter was kind of a low watermark then?", "David Dvorak", "I believe that\u2019s the case, obviously subject to the seasonality within each of the quarters for any of these businesses.", "Raj Denhoy \u2013 Thomas Weisel", "Okay. And then just one broader question on leverage. I think in your comments you mentioned that we should start to see it return in the fourth quarter. And I\u2019m curious, what are the sources of that and what are the expenses we are looking at that you\u2019ve incurred over the last several years that really start to weigh in the fourth quarter or is it really being driven by better top line performance? How do we start to drive that earnings number?", "Jim Crines", "Yes. Raj, this is Jim. I think as we get into the fourth quarter, one of the more significant drivers is clearly going to be the effect of the share repurchases over the past several quarters and from what we did as well in terms of \u2013 kind of accelerated what we getting out ahead of a little bit of what we had in our original plans this year by drawing on a credit facility is buying back 8 million shares in the quarter.", "So, clearly that\u2019s probably one of the more significant drivers. You talked about the investments we are making that are going to be showing up in SG&A over the balance of this year as we continue to focus on the training and education programs and having those running away with our meeting, pent-up demands in the marketplace, we intend to maintain investments at or above current levels on R&D and indicated what our expectations were with respect to or what are our expectations are with respect to the gross margin. So, you look at all of that and I think clearly the principal driver is going to be down below the line in the fourth quarter at this point.", "David Dvorak", "And Raj, just sequentially too if you think about the revenues improving in the second half of the year and the point that Jim made in his comments about the third quarter event of the last year, obviously you get improved top line performance and then the third quarter one-time events in the \u2013 from last year. So, as you get into the fourth quarter, all those things start working towards your advantage on bottom line performance as well.", "Raj Denhoy \u2013 Thomas Weisel", "Okay. But just if I think back to several quarters, maybe even a year when you first started laying out your spending plans, you talked about $100 million in incremental spending. That was pumped up to $120 million. The thought with that at some point half of that spending could be leveraged in the sense I think things around quality IT, those sorts of spending programs could start to come off and could start to flow to the bottom line. From your comments though, it sounds like that\u2019s not expected to happen here in 2009 that most of the leverage is maybe coming from other below-the-line items like you said. I mean, is this something that maybe we are pushing out into 2010 when we really start to see kind of the operational leverage flow through?", "Jim Crines", "Yes, I think that\u2019s fair because remember, we also talked last year about the significant disruption in things like the medical training and education, we talked about disruption in product development and so, we had a step-down in spending in those areas in 2008 and it \u2013 we talked about how the focus we are putting back on those areas to get that spending and then that spending as a result is coming back into the P&L and it\u2019s offsetting maybe some of the savings in those areas that you referenced.", "So, I think you are right. There \u2013 we are not obviously giving guidance beyond 2009, but clearly as we get into the back end of the year and begin developing plans for 2010, we\u2019d be looking for opportunities to return operating leverage above the line.", "Raj Denhoy \u2013 Thomas Weisel", "Sure. So, I guess \u2013 again, so I guess that your point about a lot of that savings that we had expected was \u2013 is getting powered back in now as you try and correct some of the share losses. But in your mind though, then just to be clear on this for 2010, some of that start to maybe get leveraged and we could really see that the bottom line start to show some benefit?", "David Dvorak", "Particularly in SG&A.", "Raj Denhoy \u2013 Thomas Weisel", "Okay.", "David Dvorak", "Yes.", "Raj Denhoy \u2013 Thomas Weisel", "Great, thanks.", "David Dvorak", "Okay.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kristen Stewart with Credit Suisse.", "Kristen Stewart \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. One of your competitors had noted that they received an IRS notification on transfer pricing. I was just wondering if you can comment if you\u2019ve been notified of any similar thing.", "Jim Crines", "We have not received a notice of proposed adjustment with respect to cost sharing arrangements.", "Kristen Stewart \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then \u2013?", "Jim Crines", "Yes, go ahead.", "Kristen Stewart \u2013 Credit Suisse", "You can finish. Sorry.", "Jim Crines", "So \u2013 and again, any material issues with respect to positions that we\u2019ve taken on our tax returns that have been filed would be described on our periodic filings.", "Kristen Stewart \u2013 Credit Suisse", "What would those material issues be that you have disclosed on the position side?", "David Dvorak", "Well there are \u2013 without getting into too much detail, Kristen, I guess that there would be some issues with respect to the Centerpulse transactions that are described in our income tax footnote. So, that \u2013 in the context of the disclosure sort of requirements that are outlined in FIN 48, we\u2019ve talked about the reserves that we have on the books to cover the \u2013 those exposures and the possibility that the IRS could come back and challenge any of those positions that we\u2019ve taken on the tax return. That\u2019s probably the most significant thing that you would see if you go back and have a look at the income tax footnote to our financial statement.", "Kristen Stewart \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then, just on the overall market growth, a year ago you were all talking about Easter having a negative impact on the growth rates. That would kind of infer that this quarter would have easier comparisons. Would you generally agree with that kind of looking at selling days and physician holidays and everything else that we had talked about last year as being a contributor to some of the more depressed comps a year ago?", "Jim Crines", "Yes, we would agree with that. I think last year we talked about that impact in growth rates in Hips and Knees by about a point. So, we would have lost a point in the first quarter of last year and picked that up in the second quarter and that is what leads us to comment on the comps with respect to Hips and Knees being a bit tougher as we move into the second quarter of 2009 and as a consequence, as we indicated, expect some softening in Hip and Knee growth rate in the second quarter of \u201909 as a result.", "Kristen Stewart \u2013 Credit Suisse", "So, your 5% growth that you had estimated within the market I think you had said, is that really effectively more like 4% if you take out that 1 percentage point impact on Easter?", "Jim Crines", "Well the 5% is for the full year, well for the first quarter and then 6% for the full year.", "Kristen Stewart \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Is it 5%? It\u2019s probably a little closer to 4% effectively?", "Jim Crines", "It\u2019s for the market. I would talk about our own results and how that impacted us. I can\u2019t speak for the competitors, so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a point or something less than a point.", "Kristen Stewart \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then last question is just, if you could comment on your GPO contracting, how much of that comes up kind of annual basis and what sort of the price levels are you seeing on new contracts?", "Jim Crines", "Yes, we talked in the past about how those GPO arrangements have turns of anywhere from one to five years. They anniversary out periodically and the pricing that we end up with on those contracts is reflected in what we are reporting out on a quarterly basis. So, if you look at the sort of modest erosion in average selling prices we are reporting out for the Americas that provides you with some indication of what\u2019s getting reflected in those arrangements.", "Kristen Stewart \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Is it fair to say that the newer contracts have less favorable pricing terms than the older ones?", "Jim Crines", "Not necessarily. There is quite a few significant number of individual pricing agreements in place as well. So, it \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t necessarily generalize.", "Kristen Stewart \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. Thank you.", "Jim Crines", "Okay.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ben Andrew with William Blair.", "Ben Andrew \u2013 William Blair", "Hi, good morning gentlemen. Just maybe a bigger picture question as you\u2019ve been through I\u2019m sure a very comprehensive analysis of your sales process and model. If you think qualitatively and I guess if we could quantitatively about the percentage of the company\u2019s revenues in the orthopedic implant business that goes back to surgeons whether in the form of royalties or consulting agreements, can you characterize that before the DPA process and after and how much it may have changed?", "David Dvorak", "Yes, I think the most that we have out in that regard would probably be the website disclosures that were mandated by the DPA and so you can get a sense as to with respect to the U.S. Hip and Knee business, what those numbers look like over the course of that time period, Ben, but as a general answer to your question, I don\u2019t think that there is material change in that regard.", "Ben Andrew \u2013 William Blair", "So, as you think about kind of 2010, 2011, you would anticipate maintaining similar types of spending as opposed to rethinking that model more broadly?", "David Dvorak", "I don\u2019t think that the fair market value justifications that were put in place with the oversight of the monitor materially alters the way those arrangements are structured where the compensation that is generated by those structures. So, it\u2019s all activity and needs based, but assuming that we are going to continue to do what we plan to do on the training and education side and there are obviously healthcare professionals that are a very important part of those efforts, as well as on the product development side, I don\u2019t see that there is going to be a material adjustment to the trends in that area.", "Ben Andrew \u2013 William Blair", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne Wuensch \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Thanks very much for taking my question. I\u2019d like to go back to gross margin. I mean, you\u2019ve implied that there is a step-down coming in the second, third, and fourth quarter, but could you help me understand are we going back down of the 76, 77 type level, how much of step-down are we looking for here?", "Jim Crines", "We are not going to get to that level of details, Joanne. I \u2013 you have the guidance that we provided in \u2013 on earnings per share, we provided some very specific comments with respect to what our expectations are on R&D spend and on SG&A. I think you\u2019ll be able to get to a pretty reasonable estimate of what that margin is going to look like that gets you within the range of $3.85 to $4 a share on the top line guidance that we provided along with the additional color that we provided on SG&A and R&D.", "Joanne Wuensch \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Can you give us an update on where you are in Hip Resurfacing?", "David Dvorak", "On the Hip Resurfacing side, our status has not changed since the last quarterly call there. There was a question that was posed in the last quarterly call about what that product would look like and our response was it\u2019s likely a next-generation product. So, provided that the solution within the United States market is internally developed, that\u2019s a longer time horizon than what it would have been prior to what occurred last year with respect to the Durom Cup.", "Joanne Wuensch \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Thanks. Could you give us an update on your sales force? I know you probably had some adjustments last year, where are you on revamping that force?", "David Dvorak", "That force \u2013 I mean, the question that\u2019s come up consistently in that regard is concerns about turnover and I would tell you that the trends there have not changed. The stability of our organization continues, any turnover is well within any kind of industry standards and our past experience in that regard. The biggest adjustments that have been made is we\u2019ve augmented our sales management team at the senior level of the organization with Jeff McCaulley\u2019s addition and I think that that transition has gone very well. There has been continuity with the prior leadership as well. So, we feel good about what\u2019s happening in that regard on the U.S. Hip and Knee side.", "Joanne Wuensch \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "But have you started adding people?", "David Dvorak", "Sure, and those adds really take place within the U.S. market at the independent distributor level. And then outside of the United States, we have many markets that are direct. And so, we are always strategically adding sales force within those markets.", "Joanne Wuensch \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "All right. what I'm trying to get at and is what I'm hearing is a more stable environment and more stable relationship with the physician, a stable sales force, and I\u2019m looking for that inflection with new products for you to be adding to the sales force and I\u2019m not hearing you say that kind of stuffs.", "David Dvorak", "Yes, in those \u2013 again, those sales force adds are really in conjunction with the areas that we are emphasizing, but the employee additions take place at the independent distributor level within the U.S. structure.", "Joanne Wuensch \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Just a final question. You talked about coming back in the OSP area, could you flush that out a little bit on the timing of a product and what it may look like? Thank you.", "David Dvorak", "Sure. Thanks for the question. We have most of the patient care products back up and running and then, bone cement accessories are a priority both for the first quarter and the second quarter. And so, we would expect to have most all of those products back in the marketplace and so, blood management would be the remaining set of products that would come out and it\u2019s our expectation that as this quarter progresses, we will make some significant progress in that regard. All of that, obviously gets us to the point where we can go back and start to compete for that business and we\u2019ll keep providing quarterly reports as to what the success rates look like in those different components of the OSP business going forward.", "Paul Blair", "Regina, in the interest of everyone\u2019s time, let\u2019s take one more question.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Rick Wise with Leerink Swann.", "Rick Wise \u2013 Leerink Swann", "Thanks for (inaudible). Couple of quick ones, just on the gross margin, I don\u2019t know whether you would be willing to quantify the amount of the hedging gain in the quarter so we can sort of see what the underlying margin is?", "Jim Crines", "Rick, I would just look at the improvement in the margin from year-over-year. That largely is a consequence, the hedge gain \u2013 well the hedge gains this year relative to the losses that we had last year.", "Rick Wise \u2013 Leerink Swann", "Okay. Two bigger, final bigger picture questions. Always appreciating it\u2019s dangerous to extrapolate from individual conversations, just a bunch of recent checks on hospitals and docs suggest that just more interest it seems to us than usual and pushing vendor consolidation more, aggressive contract renegotiations, I mean that\u2019s what that these folks are saying to us. Does all that equal even greater upcoming pressure on price? Is that something that you are seeing or should be \u2013 we should be incrementally concerned about?", "Jim Crines", "Well, I think that\u2019s been in play for some time and I would agree that over the \u2013 certainly over the course of last year, we saw that pressure intensify a bit and as a consequence, you saw our ASP \u2013 some erosion in ASPs in the back half of the year, but negative price go from where it was maybe flat in the Americas to between half-a-point and a point negative in the back half of the year. And again, that\u2019s what we saw as well in the first quarter. So, it has intensified a bit, but again it\u2019s at this point that\u2019s what you are seeing reflected in the price erosion that\u2019s being reported.", "Rick Wise \u2013 Leerink Swann", "Okay. So, it\u2019s not getting incrementally worse at this point anyway?", "Jim Crines", "They are tough conversations without a doubt and our independent distributors working together with our contract management people are working hard through those negotiations. We are providing as much support, try to get those conversations focused on clearly the benefits that these products offer to patients and with respect to the new technology, which is sometimes where those conservations are focused, the clinical benefits that these technologies offer.", "Rick Wise \u2013 Leerink Swann", "Okay. Last, just appreciating this is \u2013 during this transition period, you are using this time to just aggressively in the future, any updated thoughts on those strategic funds to acquisitions, are there acquisitions of technologies or products that are on your front-burner or are you basically done for the moment? Thanks so much.", "David Dvorak", "Thanks for the question, Rick. Our strategic direction on the external development side hasn\u2019t changed from prior conversations that we\u2019ve had. There are particular areas that we are looking at and we are not going to be exclusive about those, we are always looking to license technologies that we think can augment our existing product portfolio or address unmet clinical needs on a go-forward time period and then of course with respect to the smaller business units, there are some specific things that we would like to achieve on the external development side to augment their growth rates and be able to execute our strategic plans to develop critical mass in those areas. And so, that story has not changed and our area of focus hasn\u2019t changed and I wouldn\u2019t describe our activities as anything, but continuing to be active in that regard.", "Rick Wise \u2013 Leerink Swann", "Thanks so much.", "David Dvorak", "You are welcome. Well, thanks again everyone for joining us today and for your continued interest in Zimmer. We look forward to speaking you on our second quarter conference call at 8 AM on July 23rd. So, I\u2019ll now turn the call back to you, Regina.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation.

I am Paul Blair, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zimmer. I'd like to welcome you to the Zimmer third quarter 2009 earnings conference call.", "Joining me today to host this call are David Dvorak, President and Chief Executive Officer and Jim Crines, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning we will review our performance for the third quarter 2009, provide you with an update on certain key matters, present an update on our outlook for 2009 and conclude our discussion with the question and answer session.", "Before we get started I would like to point out that this presentation contains forward-looking statements within the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the orthopedics industry, management's beliefs and assumptions made by management.", "These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.", "For a list and description of the risks and uncertainties see the disclosure materials filed by Zimmer with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Zimmer disclaims any intention or obligation to update or review any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of such information to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures along with other financial and statistical information for the periods to be presented on this conference call was included in the press release announcing our earnings, which may be accessed from the Zimmer Web site at www.zimmer.com under the section titled \u201cInvestor Relations.\u201d", "A rebroadcast of this call will be available from approximately two hours following the conclusion of today's call through the end of the day on November 5th, 2009 and can also be accessed from the Investor Relations section of the Zimmer Web site.", "At this time I would like to introduce David Dvorak, President and Chief Executive Officer of Zimmer.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. We're glad you've joined us on the call to-date to discuss Zimmer's third quarter results. We're pleased to report that our net sales for the quarter were $976 million and that earnings per share were $0.88 adjusted, slightly above quarterly consensus expectations and in line with our annual guidance.", "Let me start by reporting on the progress we're making in restoring growth to our core reconstructive franchises. We see positive momentum continuing to build in the knee and hip franchises globally. As an example, this quarter's results and certain geographic markets including the U.S., various European countries and Japan, demonstrate the powerful clinical legacy behind NexGen, the world's largest selling knee brand.", "These results also demonstrate the broad acceptance of patient specific solutions which are represented within our knee and hip portfolios by products like our gender solutions femoral components and our ML taper stems with connective technology.", "Knee revenues in Asia-Pacific led all geographies, up 7.1% in constant currency with strong sales across the NexGen platform and increased penetration of our Unicompartmental Knee.", "Overall, during the quarter we recorded worldwide year-over-year constant currency sales growth of 3.6%, reflecting growth in all three of our major geographic segments.", "Our momentum is further evidenced by the 4.2% increase in our constant currency sequential growth rate. Reconstructive sales increased 2.3% in constant currency in the quarter.", "Knee sales in the third quarter increased 2.8% constant currency with volume and mix growth of 3.9% offset by negative price of 1.1%. Hip sales were flat in the quarter in constant currency reflecting positive volume and mix of 1.2% less negative price of 1.2%.", "In the quarter, we saw positive uptick with our new stems; including the ML taper with connective technology and the bone conserving fit more family of stems as well as solid results with our Trabecular Metal Modular Cups. We are in the initial phases of launching our new Acetabular Cup Systems outside the U.S. And early surgeon feedback on the new cup systems has been very positive. Extremity products posted outstanding results for the quarter with sales growth reported at 21% constant currency.", "Once again, our proprietary Trabecular Metal technology is playing a critical role in addressing previously unmet clinical needs in the expanding and extremities mark.", "Dental sales on a constant currency basis decreased 5.9% for the quarter. A weak global economy continues to adversely affect market demand for dental implants. While revenues in the Americas and Asia-Pacific reflected this weakness, dental sales in Europe for the quarter increased 11%.", "Trauma sales in the quarter were up over the prior period 6% constant currency with solid results in locking plates and continued uptick of the antegrade femoral and tibial nails within the new Zimmer natural nail line.", "Zimmer spine reported 26% constant currency growth in the quarter including $21 million of acquired revenue from the Abbott Spine acquisition. Solid sales of the acquired fusion devices as well as legacy interbody devices and bone graft substitutes partly offset a decline in Dynesys revenue in the quarter.", "Because the Abbott Spine transaction closed approximately one year ago future results will more clearly reflect the performance of the combined business, including sales to synergies realized as part of the integration. Orthopedic surgical products and other sales increased 6.8% in constant currency led by the reintroduced wound debridement product line.", "The realignment actions taken in the second quarter have enabled us to move ahead with a number of important strategic initiatives. In the third quarter, we bolstered our investments in product development, quality systems, talent recruitment and marketing. We intend to continue to intensify our efforts in these areas in order to maintain or return positive momentum and achieve sustained growth across all of our product franchises.", "We'll manage our spend accordingly. For example, as we saw business picking up in the third quarter, we cleared the way to accelerate certain key initiatives. We remain bullish on the opportunities for sustainable long-term growth and demand for our products.", "A recently issued research report highlights some significant data points regarding often quoted demographic and usage trends. I believe they're worth emphasizing. According to U.S. Census Bureau reports, the segment of the U.S. population between the ages of 65 and 74 is expanding at a rapid pace from a growth rate of under 1% in 2003 to a growth rate of over 5% by 2012. Similar dynamics are in play in markets outside the United States as well.", "Just as relevant are the usage statistics which indicate that the rate of joint replacement in the United States increased two and one half fold from 10 and 10,000 in 1990 to 26 in 10,000 by 2006. We believe this expansion of the market, which is likely driven by a number of factors including high long-term success rates, advances in implant designs and materials, and increasing patient awareness should continue as new innovations are introduced and patient demand and expectations grow.", "Beyond these trends, we have great optimism for current or near-term product launches. We're pleased to be collaborating with some of the most talented surgeon developers in our industry to build out our product pipeline across all of our businesses.", "In addition, to our new acetabular products, we're pleased with the continued build-out of our ortho biologics business. Further, we have more opportunities to leverage platform technology like Trabecular Metal, which can provide excellent initial fixation and stability.", "Recent 10-year clinical outcome studies demonstrate exceptional biologic in growth and increased bone density around Trabecular Metal implants. No other porous metal material so closely resembles the structure, function, and physiology of cancellous bone. This is why we continue to find applications for the technology across our various product franchises.", "Now I'd like to provide a few thoughts on some of the dynamics at work in our markets. In the third quarter, price pressure remained a factor in our results with consolidated average selling prices down 0.7% compared to the prior year period. This moderate change in price is consistent with the trends that have emerged over the course of the year. While we believe pricing pressure will continue, we don't expect to see any dramatic changes for the balance of the year.", "Turning to procedure volumes, we believe there are early signs of some improvement. The third quarter competitive results reported to-date and our internal reports suggest a bit of an easing in the procedure deferrals we've seen over the past year. This improvement appears to be more pronounced in knees globally and in hips outside of the United States. Although there continues to be some uncertainty about the rate at which procedure volumes will return, we believe this quarter's results suggest the early indications of stabilization and potential trends towards more normalized growth rates.", "Finally, I want to briefly mention healthcare reform. On our last call, I said there really wasn't enough clarity to engage in useful forecasting about the impact of healthcare reform and I think that's still true. We will continue to voice our opposition to the proposed $40 billion industry tax, which is part of the Senate Finance Committee Healthcare Reform Bill.", "We also continue to communicate our strong concerns on this matter to our elected representatives in Washington, including members of the Indiana Congressional delegation. We have been and will remain quite active through AdvaMed, the U.S. chamber and with our congressional representatives to assure Zimmer's concerns are understood and represented as the healthcare reform debate continues to play out. We remain supportive of constructive healthcare reform and we believe patients should have access to the most effective treatments as determined by healthcare professionals.", "Jim will now provide further details on the quarter and our guidance. Jim?", "Jim Crines", "Thanks, David. I will review our performance in the quarter in more detail and then provide additional information related to our guidance.", "Our total revenues for the quarter, as David mentioned, were $976 million, a 3.6% constant currency improvement compared to the third quarter of last year. Dollar weakness in the quarter resulted in lower than anticipated headwind from foreign currency translation, which decreased revenues by 1.2% or $11 million in the quarter.", "As David also indicated, consolidated pricing was down 0.7% for the quarter, pricing in the Americas and Europe was negative 1.1% and negative 0.5% respectively, while Asia-Pacific results include slightly positive average selling prices compared to the prior year third quarter.", "Our adjusted gross profit margin of 74.7% for the quarter is down 50 basis points from the prior year third quarter and in line with the comments made on the second quarter call.", "Foreign currency hedge gains as compared against prior period hedge losses were more than offset by higher unit manufacturing costs, inventory charges and idle plant costs.", "Moving down to income statement, R&D expense as a percentage of sales increased to 5.3% and at $52.1 million for the quarter is 8.8% above prior year. We expect our total dollar R&D spend to trend higher in the fourth quarter and average just over 5% of sales for the full year.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $413 million in the third quarter and are up 2.3% compared with the prior year. A 42.3% of sales, SG&A expenses are 10 basis points below prior year. We expect SG&A expenses as a percent of sales to moderate going forward.", "During the third quarter, the Company recorded a provision of $35 million for known and anticipated claims related to the Durom Cup. This brings the total provision for Durom related claims to $104 million. As previously disclosed our estimate for these claims is limited to revisions associated with surgeries that predate the 2008 temporary U.S. suspension and which also occurred within two years of the original surgery date.", "This provision is classified as a non-recurring item and is therefore excluded from our non-GAAP earnings measure. Any claims received outside of the defined parameters are managed in the normal course and reflected in our standard quarterly product liability accruals.", "Acquisition, integration, realignment and other amounted to $22.2 million in the quarter and are comprised of costs pertaining to prior period acquisitions including facility consolidation costs, litigation related charges and termination payments.", "Adjusted operating profit in the quarter was flat at $264.1 million and at 27.1% our adjusted operating profit to sales ratio is 70 basis points lower than the prior year third quarter.", "Net interest expense for the quarter amounted to $4.2 million on $600 million of outstanding net debt. As a reminder our third quarter 2008 net interest and other income of $28 million included a pretax gain of $30 million from the sale of certain assets.", "Adjusted net earnings decreased 13.9% compared to prior year at $188.3 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 9.3% to $0.88 on 214.5 million average outstanding diluted shares. These adjusted earnings per share inclusive of approximately $0.06 of share-based compensation at $0.70 reported diluted earnings per share, which include the nonrecurring items reflected in certain claims and acquisition, integration, realignment and other decreased 26.3% from prior year third quarter reported EPS of $0.95. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.6% and our anticipated full year tax rate remains around 27.5%.", "During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares at a total purchase price of $67 million. Approximately, $730 million remain authorized under a $1.25 billion repurchase authorization, which was set to expire at the end of 2009. Also in the third quarter the board of directors approved an extension of this authorization through December 31, 2010. The Company had approximately 213 million shares of common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2009, down from 214 million as of June 30, 2009.", "Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to 352.3 million, up 14% from $307.9 million in the third quarter of 2008. An increased focus on working capital management contributed to the improvement. Our most significant improvement in the quarter among all the critical financial metrics we track was in free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less cash outflows for instruments and property, plant and equipment.", "At $303.4 million in the third quarter, free cash flow is more than two times higher than the trailing six quarter average. This demonstrates meaningful progress and represents an important source of leverage going forward. At a more detailed level, adjusted inventory days on hand finished the quarter at 353 days, down 22 days from the second quarter. This is well ahead of our expectations coming into the quarter. We made more rapid progress on inventory reductions in part through stronger top-line performance.", "Our adjusted trade accounts receivable day sales outstanding finished the quarter at 63 days consistent with historically strong performance on the collection and application of cash.", "Depreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter amounted to $88.2 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $48.9 million, including $26.8 million for instruments and $22.1 million for property, plant and equipment.", "As indicated in our second quarter call, this is down substantially from prior year level as our European distribution center and Shannon, Ireland manufacturing projects are mostly complete and we adjust spending for lower production volumes.", "Cash outlays associated with investing activities during the quarter also include $7 million for acquired intellectual property and another $17.7 million for certain international distributor acquisitions.", "I'd like to turn now to our guidance. We are reaffirming sales guidance expecting full year revenues to increase from 1% to 3% in constant currency when compared to 2008. This is consistent with our expectations throughout the year. Based on current projections we now believe that foreign currency translation will reduce our reported 2009 revenues by an estimated 1.6% for the full year. Therefore, on a reported basis, our revenues are projected to be in a range of negative 0.6% to a positive 1.4% compared with 2008.", "For the fourth quarter 2009, foreign currency translation is expected to increase our revenues by an estimated 4.4%. In our earnings release this morning, we reaffirmed our full year adjusted diluted guidance to be in a range of $3.85 to $4.", "Fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be in line with the current consensus estimate of $1.07.", "David, I'll turn the call back over to you.", "David Dvorak", "Thanks, Jim. Through three quarters, our 2009 performance has unfolded largely as we had expected and we're fully focused on moving forward. We understand that improved top line performance is the key to progress. We're pleased to have stabilized our business and established new momentum. More over, we expect to restore adjusted earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter and regain leverage in 2010.", "Our optimism for Zimmer's long-term success is based on the solid foundation we're creating and on the hard work and dedication of our employees and representatives.", "Our strategic plan is in place. We'll continue to make growth-oriented investments to support our innovation and commercialization priorities. We believe our long-term outlook and opportunities are compelling.", "Demographics and clinical success in our established markets should drive growth and expansions into new product categories and emerging markets provide even greater potential. Zimmer is well positioned to focus on realizing these opportunities.", "And now I'd like to ask Celeste to begin the Q&A portion of our call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein.", "Derrick Sung \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Thanks for taking my question. If I could start on the hip and knee broad markets, it looks like the knee markets did pick up this quarter versus last quarter. I think our numbers have at least in the US growing at perhaps 6% versus 4%. And I was wondering if you could comment on whether what you are seeing is less deferral of procedures there or if you think we're actually starting to see moving of pent-up demand working through the system already.", "David Dvorak", "I think that when you reference the improvement, it looks to us to be of a point as opposed to two points within that U.S. market, Derrick. But I do think that you're just seeing stabilization. The economy broadly on variety of fronts begins to stabilize, people feel like they have more predictability in their futures and start to make decisions to move ahead, so, whether it's deferrals or a quicker turnaround of that individual it's come to the point where they need to have a replacement in either the knee or the hip category. They're moving forward with those procedures more rapidly I think. But again, this is a step. We have said all along that there was going to be no permanent solution. These were deferments. We weren't going to miss these procedures ultimately and so this is a step towards more normalized growth rate. You're really looking at kind of a point recovery of the three points to four points decline in procedure rates that we saw earlier in the year.", "Derrick Sung \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. And if you could give us a status on the update of the regulatory filings for the new Acetabular Hip Cups that you have currently filed. Are you seeing any signs of any potential delays there or are those on track from your perspective?", "David Dvorak", "Well, those are 510K filings in the United States and so the filings have been made. As is usual we respond to questions as those filings progress through. And so that's the current status of it. I don't know that there's anything that looks all that unusual about those filings at this point in time, but of course, because of the 515 request that went out earlier in the year there's some potential that those filings could take on a different form or the requests that come from the FDA could take on a different form as well. So, there's no absolute assurances to timing on those clearances.", "Derrick Sung \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "And then lastly just a question on your guidance. You sort of reaffirming the same Q4 guidance at I guess $1.07, I think this is where consensus is that you had sort of reaffirmed or guided us to last quarter despite kind of the $0.02 beat in the third quarter. Is that the right way to be looking at this? And if so why not raise your expectations for Q4?", "David Dvorak", "I think that is the right way to look at it at this point in time. And as I stated in my prepared remarks, we want to make sure we do is fund all the strategic initiatives that are going to be important to positioning the company for long-term and sustained growth. So we've got some initiatives underway that we think are the right ones, it's a well developed plan; there's a lot of clarity as to where we think there are opportunities going forward. So to the extent we were to see any additional pick-up, we're going to be accelerating the investments in those strategic initiatives.", "Derrick Sung \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Great, thank you very much.", "David Dvorak", "Thanks, Derrick.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.", "David Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Good morning and thank you for taking the question. Could you highlight for us on the gross margin line, Jim, you talked a little bit about improvements in inventory levels in your discussion about cash flow. Can you give us some ways to think about the gross margin going forward; maybe some gating on as volume increases certain percent we can start to see stabilization in the gross margin?", "Jim Crines", "I think that is. We talked obviously on the last quarter call about the step down that we anticipated coming into this quarter. And you're seeing that obviously reflected in our results at 74.7%. To your point, I would acknowledge that there is some headwind going into 2010 as we begin to sell off that higher cost inventory that sitting on the shelf. And that is the principal contributor to the step down in margin relative to what we saw in the first half of this year. I think that is fully reflected I would tell you in this quarter's results and provide some indication of what you would expect to see going forward from here.", "David Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And then as we look to next year to some of the moving parts on gross margin, currency is a negative as the dollar weakens, if I'm correct, in that at some point you work through the under absorption, but certainly FX is an issue to think about for the first half of next year.", "Jim Crines", "It is. One of the things I would point out about currency. And we provide a fair amount of detail on the impact that it's having in the year-over-year comparisons in the margin ratio, which been pretty significant this year. But in absolute terms, the hedge gains that are running through cost of goods this year are not as significant. So we take into account all the things going to impact margin going into 2010, that's certainly one of them. But there will be some other things that will potentially be going in the other direction.", "David Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then lastly, by my math, this is the first quarter in seven or eight or so, where SG&A has grown at a slower rate than sales, albeit sort of modestly. Can you maybe talk to us about what was going on there and how to think about that on a go-forward basis?", "Jim Crines", "Yes, I would say that as we talked about this before as we restore growth to the top line and made this comment in my prepared remarks. We would expect to see some moderation in SG&A spending as a percent of revenue.", "David Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then maybe just one more on volume. You talked about just looking at reported numbers and seeing a stabilization this quarter, but could you give us maybe some of the other factors you're looking at as you talk to your surgeon, customers and sales reps whether its waiting lists or referral trends, operating room schedules, et cetera?", "David Dvorak", "It's all of those things at this point, David. Those are meaningful data points; they're anecdotal really in their nature. And so we are seeing some stabilization on those various more subjective factors. Overall though, I think what we're looking at is kind of a point improvement in the quarter-over-quarter numbers and I think that's a fair estimation as to what one might see for the balance of the year. I just don't think that you're going to see anything turning negative from that improvement. And then you get into debates about how quickly you're going to see the market restored to normalized rates and some theories about whether it's going to come in the form of a bolus or not. We personally don't believe that it's going to come in the form of a bolus. But we think that over time you are just going to see a continued progression towards a more normalized procedure rate.", "David Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, thank you very much.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.", "Bob Hopkins \u2013 Bank of America", "Thanks. Can you hear me okay?", "Jim Crines", "Yes, Bob.", "David Dvorak", "Good morning.", "Bob Hopkins \u2013 Bank of America", "Great, good morning. Jim, first for you, I think David mentioned that 2010 was a year where you felt you could return to some more significant operating leverage. I was wondering if you could just remind us of the various moving parts there in terms of some of the spending that's going on in 2009 that won't materialize and in 20 0 or is that comment just strictly function of improving top line?", "Jim Crines", "It's principally a function of improved performance on the top line and as I just pointed out a minute ago, we are going to be managing the SG&A spend as a percent of revenue. You can expect to see SG&A spending grow at a slower rate than the top line and that's principal source of operating leverage. And then of course there's the leverage as we get down below the line that we can also deliver by use of putting our free cash flow to use through our share repurchase program.", "Bob Hopkins \u2013 Bank of America", "But then are there any of the quality initiatives that have trued up some spending in 2009 that you have quantified, kind of ending in 2010? Are those any specific numbers that you can talk to there?", "Jim Crines", "Well, one of the things that I will tell you helps us or puts us in a position where we can leverage that SG&A spend is, as an example, the investment that we've made in a centralized distribution hub in central Europe. In Germany, we've invested in highly automated facility and we've worked through the process of closing down a number of forward stocking points and that part of Europe and have eliminated redundant positions and spending on head count and have also been able to reduce the cost of moving inventory in and out of hospitals in that part of Europe. So that's just one of the investments that we've been able to make over the past 18 months that we're going to be able to leverage going forward. And there are others as well.", "Bob Hopkins \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay. Great. Just curious really quick follow-ups. One, do you guys have any visibility on the potential Japanese pricing changes in April? And secondly, for David, could you just give us some comments on the state of business in Europe? It seems like growth there is a little bit lower than other geographies still. What are you seeing in Europe? Are there signs of real stabilization there as well? Just any comments there would be helpful. Thanks.", "Jim Crines", "Bob, this is Jim. First of all, on the Japan adjustments and reimbursement prices, we would expect there to be some adjustment in reimbursement prices in April of next year. We do not have visibility to what those adjustments are going to look like at this point. And then if I can just take a stab at the question on Europe, I would tell you, as we look at this quarter's results, and what we believe, based on the data that we have is going on in the five major markets of Europe, we define as the UK, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, we see market growth, basically flat in the third quarter, and that's consistent with what we saw as well in the second quarter. We would expect and that's funding for single payer systems for elective procedures is maybe less available in this economic environment than it was prior to this economic downturn. Now I would tell you these are life changing procedures as we talked about and as waiting much grow in those markets, I think political pressure build to provide ultimately put some funding back into the healthcare system there to address those patient needs. So we would expect over time to see those markets recover back to mid single-digit growth and demand. Now, those five markets, as we look at it, represent about two-thirds of the total market as we define Europe. There are another 15 markets or 16 markets in Europe as we look at then that in the aggregate are growing at around mid-single digit, then continue to grow at mid single digit. Total, having the five big markets flat and then the other 15 or so markets growing in mid single digit we're seeing low, very low single-digit growth in those markets in the aggregate.", "Bob Hopkins \u2013 Bank of America", "Great, thanks for the color, Jim. I appreciate it.", "Jim Crines", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Feinstein with Barclays Capital.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Hey, great, thank you, good mornings everyone.", "David Dvorak", "Good morning, Adam.", "Jim Crines", "Good morning.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Maybe just one quick housekeeping question and then just a couple follow-ups. You gave some detailed pricing data. Just want to make sure I got that. You went through kind of fast. Just want to make sure that I had the pricing data for the U.S. for hips and knees.", "Jim Crines", "Adam, we did give pricing data for hips and knees in the aggregate. Knees were down 1.1% in the quarter. Hips were down 1.2%. It's very consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Sure. Okay. Great. And then as we look at your Recon business here, comps get very easy starting in the fourth quarter, I'm referring to constant currency basis, so distributing out the impact from FX. So, just as we think about that, do you think we can see a more normalized type of growth number coming off of these easier comps or are there other things we have to keep in mind as you guys think about the overall industry environment and pricing and what's going on there? So just curious to get your thoughts how we should interpret the growth rate for next quarter just with the comps from the price levels. Thank you.", "Jim Crines", "Sure. I think we would expect that, David's talked about before to see continuing sort of improvement in our performance in our core hip and knee franchises. I will tell you one of the things you have to obviously keep in mind with respect to the fourth quarter is the fact that we anniversary the lift we've been getting from the Abbott Spine acquisition, which was adding about two points of growth per quarter to our top line in the first three quarters of the year. And then with respect to the pace at which we see that momentum picking up in the core hip and knee franchise is some of that is going to be dependent on where we are with these new product launches. So as we said is in our prepared remarks, we're in the early stages of launching the new Acetabular Cups outside the U.S., regulatory clearances are still pending for the new cup systems here in the U.S., and the regulatory clearances are still pending with respect to our patient specific instruments on the knee side as well, which once we get there, would be, we believe will be a catalyst for improved performance going forward.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, great. One more question. Just maybe you mentioned the Spine business. Can you give us an update there, how things are going, where we are in the process? I'm just curious as you think about the growth rate of your legacy Zimmer Spine business relative to the Abbott Spine business, just wanted to get a better sense in terms of the trends in the quarter? Thank you.", "Jim Crines", "Sure. Glad to give you an update on that. I think that we continue to make good progress. I will tell you that over the course of last quarter in particular a lot of progress o-U.S. on the integration efforts, and so that's going to serve us well as we progress into 2010. Sales training, the surgeon training programs as well continue to get spun up and I think we're making good progress on that front. You end up with a lot of headwind in that type of a deal and revenue dyssynergies. And so that's principally what we're facing on the Abbott Spine side. On the Zimmer Spine side, the majority of the headwind comes in the form of Dynesys performance. And as you're probably are aware we're heading for a panel review of the Dynesys product with the broader indications coming up next month. So that's going to be telling to the future of that product line, but we are big believers in the clinical success of that product and believe that it's really a product that can make a big difference for patients. So we're quite optimistic about the future of Dynesys. So this is the proper work-in-process, I think you can look for the next couple of quarters to be continued work-in-progress and then we're going to have a lot more clarity as we work towards the middle of next year in the Spine business.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "All right. Thank you very much.", "David Dvorak", "You're welcome, Adam.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with J.P. Morgan.", "Mike Weinstein \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Thank you, good morning.", "Jim Crines", "Good morning, Mike.", "Mike Weinstein \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "First, Jim, let me just clarify; your inventory math always throws us off a bit. The map we had was less profound than I think your inventories have come down by 8 million, 9 million in the quarter. You said that your inventory days came down by 23 days. Can you just walk me through real quick your math?", "Jim Crines", "Inventory on a cash basis came down closer to 30 million in the quarter. So what's sort of netting out the decrease in inventories on a cash basis is the effect of currency translation on the inventory balances that are reported, particularly our Yen-based inventories, given the size of our business in Japan. So that's really the most significant thing you would not have obviously visibility to and how we get to the 22-day increase on a day basis.", "Mike Weinstein \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay. I want to make sure I was understanding some of the comments you're making earlier just about operating leverage. In 2010, given the pushes and pulls, what you've said about how you run the facilities and the expectations that inventories will come down and then the rollover of the FX hedges on the gross margin, do you think you generate operating leverage in 2010?", "Jim Crines", "I would tell that you that we're going to have head winds in 2010, but I think those headwinds are getting fully reflected in our gross margin this quarter and what we guided to for the second half of this year.", "Mike Weinstein \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "I'm making sure I understand what you're saying. You're saying that you think you have worked through your inventory issues in the back half of this year or the degree of degradation that we're seeing in the back half of the year is consistent with what you're assuming for 2010?", "Jim Crines", "I think the gross margin at this level is reflective of the headwinds and the principal headwind being higher unit cost inventory that we're selling through and we'll continue to sell through as we go into 2010.", "Mike Weinstein \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay. But the net picture of where you're coming at so you think you don't necessarily generate operating leverage, but you generate earnings leverage based on your usage of your cash?", "Jim Crines", "Well, that and I did talk about generating some operating leverage through the SG&A line.", "Mike Weinstein \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Yes, I'm netting out SG&A and gross margin.", "Jim Crines", "Okay.", "Mike Weinstein \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "And then, David, just I want to get your thought process. If healthcare reform goes forward and there is an excise tax on medical device companies or U.S. class II, III medical device sales, how will you manage the business differently for 2010? Have you thought that through yet?", "David Dvorak", "Sure. We have scenarios that we're building out, Mike, and there are questions about the amount, the existence of the tax first and foremost, which is you can guess we're not supportive of. We think that this is bad policy. We do think that on a broad basis, it's going to hurt innovation and you are going to find that patients get access to life changing technologies much later than they otherwise would as a consequence of that. So that's the first place to start the discussion. And we think that this is bad policy. ", "If something goes through the magnitude of such an excise tax as well as the timing are going to be the first factors that are going to have to be developed out and built into plans, if it ended up impacting 2010, then obviously you'd have to overlay that on to a developed operating plan and figure out are you going to take out and what you are going to reposition. So you're going to look at every line of the P&L if that thing comes through and it's going to affect jobs, it's going to affect the pace of innovation within our R&D portfolio as well as the ramp up of some of the other opportunities that we have, but obviously it would affect the industry, broadly, so it wouldn't be anything unique to our particular company.", "Mike Weinstein \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay. I'll let others jump in. Thanks, guys.", "David Dvorak", "Thanks, Mike.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with UBS.", "Eric Snyder \u2013 UBS", "Hi, good morning, it's Eric Snyder for Bruce. Just a couple questions. As you noted on knees and hips, the pricing pressure that you are seeing there, was that pure price or was that ASP, so price net of mix benefits and pure price?", "Jim Crines", "That for us is pure price.", "Eric Snyder \u2013 UBS", "And are you still this year able to offset that with mix?", "Jim Crines", "There is certainly mix benefit reflect and what we report out as volume mix.", "Eric Snyder \u2013 UBS", "But net ASPs up or down?", "Jim Crines", "We are generally able to much like others have reported, generally able to offset, may not be an exact offset, but generally able to offset the erosion in ASPs with positive mix benefit. As we see increased penetration, particularly with the Trabecular Metal-based implant devices", "Eric Snyder \u2013 UBS", "Okay, and then, Dave, as you noted the potential consequences of the max tax potentially going through in D.C., you didn't note an ability to pass any of those costs on to customers. Do you think that there is an option for that? Do you think it's just too rough a pricing environment to do that?", "David Dvorak", "That is certainly an option that would be fully explored. I think right now, with the number of moving pieces in the overall make-up of such a proposal it just is difficult to speculate further, Eric.", "Eric Snyder \u2013 UBS", "And then given the clear poser demographics in terms of ageing and obesity, are you still at the sort of mid single 5% to 6% expected mid to long-term unit growth for major joints?", "David Dvorak", "I think that serves the right way to characterize the broader market demand in this area, Eric, that's right.", "Eric Snyder \u2013 UBS", "Okay, great, thank you very much.", "David Dvorak", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Credit Suisse.", "Kristen Stewart \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could just dive a little deeper on the pricing side. I think you guys had anniversaried some of the price cuts in Australia in July, so can you break out just the hip and knee pricing in Americas and Europe? In the Americas, looks like the past two quarters there's a little bit of a decline in pricing. I guess it falls in Europe. If you just help us fill in the pieces there?", "Jim Crines", "Sure. Kristen, in the Americas, knee pricing was down 1 5 points in the quarter. Hip pricing was down 1.7%,and I think you'll find that's very consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year. Asia-Pacific, where we saw some improvement in price trends in the quarter, given that we anniversary that of both the April, Japan price adjustments and the July, Australia price adjustments, we had positive price on hips about half a point and still negative price on knees of about half a point. And then in Europe, knee pricing was down just 2/10th of a point and hip pricing was down 1.4%.", "Kristen Stewart \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thanks. And then I guess just in terms of how we should think about kind of a pricing, I know you guys generally do in some instances multi-year contract, so can you help to kind of, it seems that the incremental new contracts, particularly in the Americas maybe down, obviously much larger than your balance of your book of business. So what does that really tell us about kind of trends going forward? How confident are you that we won't see further pressure in kind of the Americas?", "Jim Crines", "Yes, what I would tell you, what we've seen in the Americas over the past three quarters has been very consistent with hip and knee pricing down about a 1.5 or a little more than a 1.5. I guess one of the things you have to understand, when we talk about increased pressure on pricing is that the price adjustments do not always coincide with contract renewal dates. So we've seen broadly and have had to deal broadly with request for proposals from many of our hospital systems and that is really what's getting reflected in the trends that we've seen over the past three-quarters. So we think it is very representative of what's going on more broadly across the entire U.S. market.", "Kristen Stewart \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And then just kind of looking at, I guess the hip business, particular within the Americas, can you just remind us again what the impact last quarter was with the Durom suspension in terms of how we should think about kind of apples to apples growth rate within the business?", "Jim Crines", "Kristen, I have to say I don't have that right here in front of me. And off the top of my head, I'm not going to be able to answer that question.", "Kristen Stewart \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, no problem, I'll take that offline and then I guess last question would be, you obviously had very strong cash flows in the quarter, only repurchased 6 million to 7 million in terms of shares, how are you thinking about the use of cash kind of moving into 2010 and what will the role of acquisitions play? Do you still feel comfortable getting to a double-digit earnings growth rate absent any acquisitions?", "Jim Crines", "Yes, I would tell you as we said before that our first priority for use of free cash flow would be focused on any strategic opportunities that we would identify where, particularly where we would have the opportunity to continue to build out the other musculoskeletal franchises outside of our core hip and knee franchises, where we have smaller market share position. Talked about the interest that we have in Spine, the Abbott Spine deal is representative of the kind of deal that would look very attractive to us. Certainly, continue to have an interest in building out our ortho biologics portfolio and do that through a combination of potential acquisitions or licensing, like the licensing arrangement we've entered into with Sacagacu [ph]. So that will remain sort of our first priority with respect to the use of free cash flow and then to the extent that there are no immediate opportunities in front of us, we would otherwise put it to use through our share repurchase program. We have over 700 million remaining over the share repurchase authorization that as I pointed out in my remarks has now been extended out through December 2010.", "Kristen Stewart \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And then just the confidence in 10% kind of growth absent acquisition earnings growth?", "Jim Crines", "We'll talk very specifically about what our expectations are for 2010 on our fourth quarter call.", "Kristen Stewart \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thank you very much.", "Jim Crines", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Leerink Swann.", "Rick Wise \u2013 Leerink Swann", "Good morning, everybody. Turning back to trauma, we've seen stable growth year-over-year in the first three quarters. One of your competitors reported yesterday, one of the bigger players, very strong results. I'm trying to gauge just your thoughts about how, when and where Zimmer might start to gain share in trauma. You highlighted your new nail line. When do we start to see the impact of that and other new products?", "Jim Crines", "We expect to show the impact of that in some of the investments that we've made strategically as we progress into 20 10, Rick.", "Rick Wise \u2013 Leerink Swann", "So is it too much to think we might see accelerating growth rate as we get into 2010 helped by the new products hopefully?", "Jim Crines", "Yes, that's exactly what we expect to be able to produce in the way of results.", "Rick Wise \u2013 Leerink Swann", "And I know you're not going to give us 2010 guidance, but just thinking conceptually about gross margin, looking at the year ahead, I'm sort of wondering whether 2010 gross margin flow might be the reverse of what we've seen in 2009 with a weaker first half as you've suggested, a rebound in the second half as the higher cost inventory works through, volumes continue to grow. But just in general, ending up with gross margin much like the sort of 76% kind of range we're talking about for this year, is that the right kind of thought process?", "Jim Crines", "Well, that is getting into 2010 guidance, Rick. I think at this stage, I would just repeat what I've said earlier and that is that kind of the headwinds in terms of the higher unit manufacturing costs that we're currently dealing with and going to continue to deal with going into 2010 are fully reflected in our results this quarter. We have still a year's worth of inventory on hand. So it will take some time before we're able to benefit from the increased leverage that we will eventually get as we see more volume running through our facility.", "Rick Wise \u2013 Leerink Swann", "Okay, dental still is weak as you've suggested. Maybe any additional color you can give us there, any signs of stabilizing or anything that might change the outlook for that business in coming quarters?", "David Dvorak", "Well, I think that you're just looking at the macroeconomic factors. The unemployment rates, the consumer confidence levels, the financial community getting back in order and providing capability for these people to secure the resources that they need for the broader procedures, especially in the private pay markets. So those are all the broad factors. But I would tell you that's a market we don't have double-digit market share and I'm not sure that we're the ones to provide with you much more color on that at this point, Rick.", "Rick Wise \u2013 Leerink Swann", "Okay. And two last questions. Maybe just a little more color on your comments about going back to the Recon market, the growing and building sales momentum. Is this more in existing accounts are you at the point now where you feel like you're winning competitive accounts as you move past issues in the last couple of years?", "Jim Crines", "I would describe it as stabilization of the customer base, Rick.", "Rick Wise \u2013 Leerink Swann", "Driving things more. And on the shorter term basis, just thinking about SG&A as we move from the third quarter, fourth quarter, clearly you're getting the positive SG&A leverage. I'm guessing currency helps a little bit. But to get to the consensus numbers, we'd have to see a pretty strong step up, something approaching 40 million sequential increase plus or minus, depending on other numbers. And appreciating the seasonal nature of SG&A is it possible that there might be a little more leverage as we look ahead to the fourth quarter than those numbers might suggest?", "Jim Crines", "I think it's fair to say that just given the seasonality in the business it's fair to expect that we're going to see some significant improvement going from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.", "Rick Wise \u2013 Leerink Swann", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.", "Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. So first question on inventories. I just a few follow-ups here on some things that I think folks have touched on, on the call, and then I had a sort of broader question for you, Jim, and one for David. So the follow-ups here, inventories as you talked about were down. I wish I could get a sense of where you are in terms of capacity utilization as you think about your current production levels versus a year ago. And maybe if you could just talk about when you think you're going to get back to sort of a normalized rate, just because that seems to be sort of the predictive element of when gross margins will start to (inaudible) from current levels.", "Jim Crines", "Well, of course, a lot of that. Matt it's going to be dependent on the momentum on the top-line as well as whether or not we see some recovery and when we will see a recovery and the five major markets in Europe. We talked about earlier. Some of that will depend certainly on getting the 510Ks that we have in cleared. But we would expect the utilization from current levels will improve in a linear fashion from here. And then it's just a question of how steep that improvement is going to be. And as I said, all that is going to depend on, couple things I mentioned, when we would see a recovery in those major markets in Europe and when specifically we would be able to get clearances, particularly for the new Acetabular Cups here in the U.S.", "Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Just on that, I mean you do have new products filed. I'm assuming that you don't wait for approval before you start ramping production. We have seen slight improvement here in terms of deferrals in the third quarter. So have you started to get to a point where you've eased back into some production level higher than, you took it down pretty significantly in the first half, is that correct?", "Jim Crines", "We did. And it does increase from here for the sort of very reasons that you stated. And some of these new products as we pointed out were in the early stages of launching those products outside the U.S. So the production volumes, there's the opportunity, obviously for those production volumes to increase once those products are cleared and out in the marketplace and you're not just building the pipeline, but the facilities are responding to demand for replenishment once those products have been commercialized.", "Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay, that's helpful. Another follow-up here on, I think there were some questions on the European market. It looked like they have kind of improved little earlier than w were expecting on a constant currency basis. Is there anything there that's changed? And also is there any difference that you see there in terms of hips and knee performance? You mentioned the bunch of markets that are still growing, and the major markets are maybe stabilizing, but anything in terms of competition or your product that would sort of drive the recovery in knees before hips?", "Jim Crines", "Well, I would tell you where we saw the significant improvement in performance on the knee side was not so much in Europe as it was more for us in our case at least there was more Asia-Pacific and specifically Japan. What we saw in Europe in the quarter was we think fairly consistent with what we saw in the second quarter.", "Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay. And then lastly, the follow-up here and then I do have a couple of questions, but on Spine, you talked about Dynesys, David, and annualizing some of the dyssynergies here heading into the fourth quarter. There's a lot of moving parts there. Dynesys seems to be currently challenged, but then you have this new indication, new data that could drive further adoption. What's the strategy there for returning the core business to grow post the comps? Is it penetration of Pathfinder? Do you need the new indications for Dynesys to grow that business?", "David Dvorak", "The strategy for growth there is we really have a broad foundation of fusion offerings at this point in time, post integration of the Abbott Spine deal. So you have everything that you need on the outer body and the inner body side within the fusion market, as well we have a strong MIS offering between Pathfinder and the technologies and products we picked up through the NDS acquisition. So that's comes together very nicely. It is the case that as you suggest that the broader indication on Dynesys is going to be very important to restoring the right trajectory on that franchise and the path there really is the broader claims allow us to go back and address the non-coverage decisions. I don't think anyone either among the surgeon users or within our business has question about the clinical efficacy of that product and the solution that it provides for patients. So we need to get the broader indication so that we can address those non-coverage decisions over time and get that important franchise that truly is a differentiator for us back on track and then continue to emphasize the MIS offerings.", "Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Jim, on the P&L, it's just a broad question as you look forward and I'm not trying to pin you down here for 2010 growth or anything like that, but I think if I understand, the goal is to sort of restore some level of sales growth and then to achieve some kind of acceleration to the bottom-line, in very sort of long terms. But what level of top line growth is enough to give you some meaningful leverage to the bottom line, putting aside year-over-year comps that you're facing now? On a go-forward basis is low to mid single-digit enough? Do you feel like you need to break the mid single-digit level, given your margin structure to show acceleration?", "Jim Crines", "That is a tough question to answer at this point, Matt. We'll be able to respond to that very specifically when we comment with guidance for 2010. Certainly, the opportunity is there longer-term, at least in terms of how we think about it with the market longer-term on a unit basis growing in mid single-digit, and opportunity beyond that with some positive mix benefit, net mix benefit coming from the introduction of new innovative devices.", "Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "And last one here, for David, on healthcare reform, just a broad question, David, about this element of comparative effectiveness. You've talked about the great success, life restoring benefits of joint replacement, which I think a lot of folks would agree with. But is there any strategy to sort of put data on the board that would help position you in the sort of a new world of clinical evaluation that we may be facing from payers?", "David Dvorak", "It's going to become more and more important. Not only the clinical efficacy, but the economics of these solutions and we have such a great story to tell within our space in particular. You look at these procedures and over half the people that have a hip or knee replacement are returned to work, that were out of work previously. If you look at it from the individual's perspective, the cost of managing these chronic conditions, this replacement will lead to savings of anywhere estimated from $68,000 to $180,000 per individual. So, whether you're looking at the broad system cost or the individual cost, these procedures with 90-plus percent success rate, 10 years, 20 years into the replacement, I have a great story to tell. ", "And the economic development to that story and communication of it we need to do a better job on that front. And I think that that's true for the broader industry too, when you start talking about healthcare reform. I mean no one argues with the desirability of getting more access to patients. It's a matter of how you do it and how you build greater efficiencies into the system without inhibiting the innovation that leads to these better outcomes for individuals and greater efficiencies and economies in a broad sense. So those are the points that we make in these discussions, I think that accrued and material excise tax that's currently being proposed cuts very much against the core substance of what is trying to be repaired with healthcare reform so comparative effectiveness makes sense, a $40 billion tax does not.", "Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "That's helpful, thanks.", "David Dvorak", "Sure.", "Paul Blair", "Celeste, in the interest of everyone's time, let's take one more question.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Tao Levy with Deutsche Bank.", "Tao Levy \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Great, thanks a lot for filling me in. I have two quick questions. One, I was wondering given that some of the regulatory of the new products that you're expecting to improve haven't come through how much sort of the inventory improvement that we saw in the quarter was somewhat related to not having to build for those new products and how much was sort of real work down of products?", "David Dvorak", "I don't think, Tao, the improvement in the quarter was at all material. To some extent, you end up with these pending approvals and then you're going ahead with build plans in anticipation of the approvals. So I don't think that you would see anything other than a modest impact on the deferral of those clearances.", "Tao Levy \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "I was actually going after the sort of the inventory levels that you have. I don't know if you're starting to build up already for them or in the last quarter you kind of alluded to inventories potentially either staying flat with the second quarter because of these new products that you're going to be manufacturing.", "David Dvorak", "I think that what we talked about in the past is just that there's a little bit of a wash out effect. We're doing a better job of managing our inventory more efficiently and more effectively and at the same time we're starting to ramp up the production for these new product launches in anticipation of those clearances and finding some traction with the commercialization of the new products. And so there's a washing out as between the two, but net we still saw improvement in the quarter, obviously.", "Tao Levy \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Perfect. And on the hip side, when I look at the numbers from the companies that reported, looks like maybe you lost a little bit of share sequentially. Is that more in related to these new products that you're expecting?", "David Dvorak", "Yes, I think that we don't believe that we're losing customers at this point in time. We may be losing some cases because of those gaps that we talked about extensively in the past and these product launches that are underway right now. O-US fill those gaps and then some. We have some very differentiated technology built into the Acetabular Cups, for instance, and so we're really optimistic about the future there and then of course to get after those same opportunities within the U.S. market is going to require these clearances coming through.", "Tao Levy \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Great, thanks a lot.", "David Dvorak", "Okay, thank you, Tao. And thanks again everyone for joining us today and for your continued interest in Zimmer. We look forward to speaking to you on our fourth quarter and year-end conference call at 8:00 A.M. on January 28, 2010.

I am Paul Blair, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zimmer. I would like to welcome you to the Zimmer First Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference call. Joining me today to host this call are David Dvorak, President and Chief Executive Officer and Jim Crines, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning we will review our performance for the first quarter, provide you with an update on certain key matters, present an update on our outlook for 2010 and conclude our discussion with the question-and-answer session.", "We understand that this is a very busy reporting day and we\u2019ll do our best to keep today\u2019s call close to an hour in length. Therefore, we ask that participants pose one question, with one follow up to allow as many callers as possible the opportunity to take part in today\u2019s call.", "Before we get started I would like to point out that this presentation contains forward-looking statements within the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the orthopedics industry, management\u2019s beliefs and assumptions made by management.", "These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.", "For a list and description of the risks and uncertainties see the disclosure materials filed by Zimmer with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

We\u2019re glad you\u2019ve joined us on the call today. This morning, I\u2019ll review our first quarter 2010 results and provide comments on highlights from the quarter. Jim will then provide additional financial details. Net sales for the quarter were $1.1 billion, an increase of 3.4% on a constant currency basis and our earnings per share were $1.02 on an adjusted basis.", "Our sales performance reflects incremental constant currency growth over the fourth quarter of 2009 of 90 basis points. Sales results improved when compared with the fourth quarter in the Americas and Asia Pacific but remained under pressure in Europe, Middle East and Africa segment and large part due to the challenging economic environment in that region. For the quarter, we once again recorded year-over-year sales growth in all three of our geographic reporting segments. Americas showed 2.8% constant currency growth while Europe, Middle East and Africa grew slower as we anticipate at 1.1%.", "Asia Pacific again let our geographic segments with a solid 10.8% constant currency growth. Knee sales for the quarter improved year-over-year 7.4% on a reported basis and 3.8% constant currency reflecting positive volume and mix of 5% less negative price of 1.2%. Sales of partial knee devices including the Zimmer Uni Knee and the Gender Solutions Patellofemoral Joint contributed to knee growth for the quarter. Also showing growth for the quarter were later stage devices like the NexGen Legacy Constrained Condylar Knee and Rotating Hinge Knee.", "We\u2019re confident that initiatives already underway will accelerate the growth of our primary knee systems and drive further improvement in performance of our knee franchise this year. At AAOS we debuted an expansion of our patient specific instrument portfolio by adding our natural knee brand to the recently cleared NexGen brand. Our patient specific instruments are proprietary toolset customized to the individual patient\u2019s anatomy and our design is streamlined total knee replacement procedures by ensuring the successful implementation of the surgeons preoperative plan.", "We\u2019re pleased with the yearly clinical feedback on these instruments and expect to further leverage our industry leading knee systems with the continued rollout of patient specific instruments as well as other innovative instruments that we expect to launch midyear. Hip sales for the quarter improved year-over-year 5.4% on a reported basis and 1% constant currency reflecting positive volume and mix of 2.1% less negative price of 1.1%.", "Sales of revision hip products such as the Zimmer Modular Revision Hip and the Trabecular Metal Revision Shell and Augment Cups were strong in the quarter when compared to prior year. As were sales of BIOLOX delta heads. With 140 basis points of incremental growth over the fourth quarter, we see positive signs in our hip business. The global launches of our Continuum System and MMC Acetabular products are underway. But as we described before we don\u2019t expect to see a meaningful impact from these new product introductions until the second half of this year. After sets of implants and instruments are more widely deployed.", "We are however on track with our expectations for the stage rollout of these products and the initial clinical feedback has been quite positive. The Continuum System further reinforces Zimmer\u2019s commitment to providing surgeons with the most comprehensive flexible and integrated array of metal, ceramic and polyethylene solutions to meet the diverse and unique needs of (Erotola) hip replacement patients.", "In combination with our comprehensive stem portfolio including our Fitmore Hip Stem and our M/L Taper with connective technology, the Continuum System offers surgeons tremendous flexibility and confidence to personalize the implant solution. Extremity products posted healthy results for the quarter with sales growth of 13.9% constant currency. Our Trabecular Metal Technology has played a key role on the success of this product line as the TM Reverse Shoulder and TM Glenoid continue their outstanding growth trends. Following a year of weaker demand caused by the global recession our dental sales increased 6.2% constant currency for the quarter.", "Sales of our implants restorative components and regenerative products all grew in the quarter. The Asia Pacific region reported the largest increase in dental sales at 23.9% for the quarter, with distributors in the region restocking as demand begins to recover from the depressed levels of the prior year. Trauma sales in the quarter were up over the prior year period 2.7% constant currency.", "Sales of Non-Contact Bridging plates, Cable products, Intramedullary Nails and locking plates and screws contributed to growth in the quarter. The comprehensive rollout of our natural nail system remains key to driving improved performance in Trauma. The rollout continued during the quarter with a limited release of a (circular-medullary) nail. The reception of the CM Nail System has been extremely positive with surgeons who have commented on ease of use due to the anatomical nail system, proprietary fixed angle locking screw technology and intuitive instrumentation.", "Zimmer Spine reported a sales decrease of 9.1% constant currency in the quarter. Our spinal business continues to experiences challenges related impart to the Dynesys Dynamic Stabilization System. But we remain committed to the product category. We expect incremental growth opportunities for Dynesys in regions outside the United States. Overall, signs of improvement in our spine business are reflected in the growth reported by our international units and in the positive worldwide growth recorded for acquired spine products including the Pathfinder MIS platform, the Ardis Interbody System, the Universal Clamp and the Sequoia Pedicle Screw System.", "For the quarter, spine sales increased 15% in Europe and 7.7% in Asia Pacific although our base is relatively small compared to our Americas business. Europe and Asia Pacific growth is coming from stabilization of our distribution channel, resulting from our 2009 integration efforts. In the first quarter, our orthopedics surgical products franchise experienced 18.3% constant currency growth. Sales of Wound Debridement devices were up over 65% in the quarter as our global sales channel continued to make progress on recovering market share in the category.", "Bone cement and powered instruments also reported strong number in the quarter compared to prior year. I want to make particular note of the excellent performances for the quarter by our Dental and OSP businesses and by our Asia Pacific team. Each has faced considerable challenges for nearly two years. And I\u2019d like to thank these teams for the work that they have done to turn their performance around. There are couple of other topics I\u2019ll touch on briefly. Regarding pricing, consolidated average selling prices in the first quarter were down 0.7% compared to the prior year period. We experienced negative pricing of 1.1% in the Americas, positive pricing in our Europe, Middle East, and Africa region, a 0.2% and  negative pricing in the Asia Pacific region of 0.4%.", "Now please keep in mind that by annual pricing adjustments in Japan did not go into effect until April 1. The consolidated pricing for the first quarter was consistent with our expectations and we continued to anticipate moderate price erosion of minus 1 to minus 2% for the year. Volume trends across our geographic regions were largely in line with our expectations for the quarter. Volumes throughout our Europe, Middle East and Africa region continued to be suppressed but appear stable as contemplated in our guidance.", "In the Americas and Asia Pacific regions, demand appears to be returning to pre-recession levels. Finally with respect to guidance, as we said in our earnings release this morning we are reaffirming our outlook for 2010. Jim will now provide further details on the quarter and our guidance. Jim?", "James Crines", "Thanks David. I will review our performance in the quarter in more detail and then provide additional information related to our 2010 guidance. Our total revenues for the quarter as David mentioned were $1.63 billion, a 3.4% constant currency improvement compared to the first quarter of last year. Dollar strengthened the quarter resulted in a tailwind from foreign currency translation which increased revenues by 3.7% or $36 million in the quarter. Our adjusted gross profit margined at 74.9% for the quarter was in line with our expectations and 230 basis points below the prior year. As expected higher unit cost of products sold and foreign currency hedge losses as compared with prior period hedge gains account for the majority of the change.", "As we continued to build and deploy pipeline inventory of our recently cleared (Acetabular) Cup products and our new line of Intramedullary Nails as well as experienced steady growth in our quarterly constructive business we improved utilization across our manufacturing network. As a result and also taking into account the change in our outlook for foreign currency translation, we are now expecting our gross margin ratio to be between 75 and 76% for the full-year.", "Moving down the income statement, R&D expense as a percentage of sales was at 4.8% and at $51 million for the quarter is 1.8% favorable on the total dollar basis when compared to the prior year. Our R&D spend in the prior year was higher due to the extensive development activities underway at that time related to the Continuum and MMC Cup products as well as the Zimmer Natural Nail.", "We are expecting R&D expense to increase through the balance of the year as new development programs accelerate. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $447 million in the first quarter but that 42% of sales SG&A expenses were 70 basis points below prior year first quarter, Medical training and education expenses increased in the quarter as compared to the prior, spending related to certain operational excellence and growth initiatives also contributed to higher expenses in the quarter. As a consequence of accelerating these programs SG&A as a percentage of sales is now anticipated to be between 41 and 42% for the full year.", "Continuing down the income statement, acquisition, integration, realignment and other amounted to $2.6 million in the quarter and included cost principally related to prior period acquisitions. Adjusted operation profit in the quarter increased to $298 million, a 27% our adjusted operating profit to the sales ratio is a 130 basis points below prior year first quarter largely due to higher product cost. Net interest expense for the quarter amounted to $14.6 million compared to $3.7 million in the prior year quarter mainly due to the $1 billion senior unsecured notes offering we completed in November of 2009. Adjusted net earnings were $207.4 million for the quarter, a decrease of 1.2% compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 7.4% to $1.02 on $204.2 million average outstanding diluted shares.", "These adjusted earnings per share inclusive of approximately $0.05 of share based compensation. At $1.01 reported diluted earnings per share which include the items reflected in acquisition, integration, realignment and other increased 11% over the prior year first quarter reported EPS of $0.91. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 26.8% in line with our expectations. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares at a total purchase price of $94 million. As of March 31, 2010 approximately $180 million remained authorized under our $1.25 billion repurchase program which expired at the end of 2010. The company had approximately 203 million shares of common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2010 down from 204 million as of December 31, 2009.", "Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $260 million, up 41% from a $185 million in the first quarter of 2009. In the prior year quarter, we resolved outstanding payments to healthcare professionals and institutions resulting in substantial cash outflows. The strong results for the quarter also reflect the benefit of our continued efforts to streamline inventory investments. Overall, the operating cash flow for the first quarter is representative of our expectations for continued strength in cash flow.", "A $209 million in the first quarter free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow as cash outflows for instruments and property, plant and equipment is in line with our expectations at this point in the year. Adjusted inventory days on hand finished the quarter at 302 days, a decrease of 71 days compared to the first quarter of 2009 as a result of field and central warehouse base inventory reductions achieved in the second half of 2009. Our adjusted trade accounts receivable day sales outstanding finished the quarter at 60 days, a decrease of one day from the first quarter of 2009.", "Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter amounted to $84.9 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $50.9 million including $39.3 million per instruments and $11.6 million for property, plant and equipments. We expect capital expenditures to be higher in each of the subsequent quarters for the remainder of the year as we replace machinery and equipment in the normal course and invest in instruments to support our new product launches. Cash outlays associated with investing activities during the quarter includes $2.9 million for certain international distributor acquisitions.", "I\u2019d like to turn now to our guidance for 2010. In our earnings release this morning we reaffirmed our full-year constant currency sales and adjusted earnings per share guidance. Full-year revenues are expected to increase between 3 and 5% on a constant currency basis assuming foreign currency exchange rates remained near recent levels, the company estimates that foreign currency translation will increase revenues by 1.5% for the full-year of 2010 resulting in expected revenue growth on a reported basis between 3.5 and 5.5%.", "2010 full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be in a range of $4.15 to $4.35. David, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you Jim. In the first quarter we made progress that will enable us to accelerate our growth. Our improving performance and incremental manufacturing throughput are allowing us to increase investments in several strategic initiatives. We\u2019re also encouraged by improvements in working capital management which help generate strong cash flows during the quarter.", "In addition, our new product launches are progressing and we\u2019re continuing to deploy instruments and implants and the medical education associated with the new systems. As mentioned earlier, the clinical feedback we\u2019ve received both in the early launches domestically and in jurisdictions outside the U.S., where they\u2019ve been in use for a number of months gives us further optimism that these products are providing surgeons with excellent solutions for their patients.", "More broadly our organization has a sense of excitement coming off the AAOS meeting and we\u2019re driving our strategic plan and moving forward with confidence. And now I\u2019d like to ask (Celeste) to begin the Q&A portion of our call.", "Question-and-Answer-Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.", "Raj Denhoy", "Well hi, good morning guys.", "David Dvorak", "Good morning.", "James Crines", "Good morning.", "Raj Denhoy", "I wonder if I guess about the hip and knee business, it\u2019s still broadly lagging the other competitors that have reported so far. I\u2019m curious if you could maybe just give some thoughts around what\u2019s happening there, I know you still had product launches that come later this year, by our tally you should have anniversary this year losses, particularly on the hip side and from about a year or so ago. Why is that business still suddenly lagging the market?", "David Dvorak", "Yes, we\u2019re looking to make material improvements in the performance of those two franchises Raj and a lot of this does relate to those product launches that you mentioned. On the hip side, the Acetabular Cups are going to give us great opportunities to pair those up with what we believe to be industry leading technology on the stem side and we\u2019re already seeing early indications that (hypothesis) is going to prove very much true, those sets do take time to get out and as we\u2019ve said it really is a second half for the year productivity story for us on the deployments, in the jurisdictions overseas where the Cups have been launched and I\u2019d probably see that early period six months into the process, we\u2019re already seeing improvements in the performance in those markets.", "So the uptake has been attractive. I am absolutely confident that we\u2019re going to see the same experience in the U.S. markets. On the knee side, it\u2019s much the same story. We mentioned PSI, we\u2019re getting good up-tick in that already. I would tell you that I think it\u2019s going to be a growth driver for us principally in the U.S. marketplace, but there are other instruments that we\u2019ll be launching midyear that we\u2019re going to put us in a much more competitive advantage for instruments to be responsive to what the surgeons are looking for. They\u2019re looking for simpler instruments that take time out of the OR, lead to reproduce more results for more ergonomically design and we have a great solution that we\u2019ll be launching in midyear in that category.", "So we\u2019re very optimistic about the prospects for improving both of those key franchise, key franchise performances within the year.", "Raj Denhoy", "So you think maybe by third, fourth quarter you\u2019ll be back to market growth rates whatever those may be at that point, but you think (you\u2019re back to the market)?", "David Dvorak", "Yes, I would expect this year that we would be back to market growth rates in both those franchises and we\u2019re going to be working towards and expectation of delivering above market growth rates in hips.", "Raj Denhoy", "OK, and then just for my second question, I just want to ask you a bit, you made a comment towards the end of your prepared remarks about how improvements in manufacturing profitability is allowing you to increase investments in other areas of businesses. I may have not gotten that correct, but something to that effect and I am curious into this broadly speaking how that plays out in terms of your business, I mean one of the real opportunities here is that your margin structure is still significantly lower than where it\u2019s been, and I\u2019m curious as we move to the year and as manufacturing productivity starts to improve, how do you balance allowing some more of that to potentially fall to the bottom line to potentially increasing investments again in some of the other areas of the businesses, how you really manage that dynamic going forward?", "James Crines", "Yes, there are \u2013 Raj, this is Jim and there are couple of questions there, I\u2019ll attempt to answer. We mentioned as you indicated that we are accelerating investments and certain operational excellence in growth initiatives. Without going into too much detail, those investments are generally in the area of sales and marketing support for new products and included just by \u2013 just to give one example of sales planning and scheduling tools that could be used to optimize field inventory and instrument appointments as we get into these major and new product launches.", "So I guess the other thing I would tell you is that, just given where we are with these new product launches in this operating period and the focus of those investments is now actually going to be on sales and marketing. I think we \u2013 you can expect coming out of this operating period, we\u2019d like to be investing more money in research and development to accelerate new product development programs, but as we look forward into future operating periods we would look to fund any increased in our R&D spending with savings from SG&A.", "Raj Denhoy", "So I guess this \u2013 broadly speaking and I guess you guys reiterate your guidance on the bottom line this year, like it sounds like you\u2019re maybe seeing better productivity improvements but your spending those, to put bluntly.", "James Crines", "In this operating period given the opportunities that David talked about with respect to the new product launches, we are investing in going after those opportunities. Again that\u2019s in the context of this current operating period.", "Raj Denhoy", "OK, great. Thanks a lot.", "David Dvorak", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.", "David Roman", "Good morning everybody, thanks for taking the question. Just, Jim in your prepared remarks you referenced I think you took gross margin guidance from about 75% net off 75 to 76, and I think the two factors you said were better product mix and also foreign currency. Can you maybe break down for us what the drivers are for the 100 basis point increasing in guidance. How much of that is mix, how much of that is FX?", "James Crines", "Sure, so again with the build out of the pipeline for our new Acetabular Cup products as well as our new line of Intramedullary Nails, we\u2019re seeing increase throughput across the manufacturing network. We expect that to continue through the first half for the year. So we\u2019re now putting lower cost inventory to the shelf and anticipate that inventory is going to turn in the second half for the year.", "So in part, that\u2019s what leads us to a higher expectation for the gross margin ratio for the second half. Now I said, pointed out that product volumes are expected to peak in the first half of 2010 with these pipeline inventory builds and then (Taper) off perhaps in the second half for the year and there is about a six month lag in recognition of those efficiencies, across to that work.", "Now how much of it (tapers) off will depend in part on the success we have with penetration in those new products as well as procedure growth rates across our core markets. So and that accounts for about half of the improvements David, that\u2019s reflected in the updated guidance that we provided. The other half is related to the change in outlook that we have for foreign currency.", "David Roman", "OK.", "James Crines", "So, yes if you use the rates that were in effects, at the time that we gave our guidance at the beginning of the year, we clearly had a different outlook with respect to hedge losses we were projecting at the time relative to the gains that we had experienced last year.", "David Roman", "OK, and then on the guidance of 450 to 435, you kept the same queue, you give us as to what the drivers are at either end of that, in the 435 number how much is dependent on Continuum and MMC gaining traction versus an improvement in the overall market than at the 415 level, is that assumes really no uptake from mix and it continued slower recovery in the end user market?", "David Dvorak", "Those are the principal drivers, that\u2019s right David, I mean really is top line driven and those are the biggest product categories that we have. The one that I would add into that in addition to the instruments on the knee side and the cups on the hip side would be the nail launch within trauma.", "David Roman", "OK, and then lastly David, you talked about the spine, just trying to more aggressively go after the U.S. piece of it. Can you maybe talk us through some of the investments that you\u2019re making and what type of catalyst or data points we should look for, I mean in the next six to 12 months to give some more clarity on the status of that business.", "David Dvorak", "Yes, I think that in the short term we had good opportunities to grow above market rates (OUS). We have a good product portfolio, it\u2019s actually broader because it includes some of the non-fusion solutions that we have within that bag at this point in time. And then what we\u2019re looking to do is correct out that performance so that we\u2019re exiting this year back at market overall and that\u2019s going to obviously require some pretty significant improvement in our U.S performance and that\u2019s going to come in the form of new product launches. We\u2019re excited about some of the things that we have going on, especially in the MIS category there and just better sales execution as well. So I think that what you want to look for and hold us accountable to is a continued performance improvement trend through the year, exiting the year at about market growth rates and then a good cadence of new product launches thereafter that are going to sustain that growth as build the business out.", "David Roman", "OK, thank you very much.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you, David.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with UBS.", "Mike Duncan", "Thank you, hi this is actually Mike Duncan for Bruce. What product gaps do you feel like you have in knees that would kind of explain I guess the slightly below market growth rate you have there?", "David Dvorak", "I think that the instruments are the only gap of any significance at all at this point in time in our portfolio. We have the leading knee systems as far as clinical performance globally as evident side of the registry data that is continuously published in both NexGen, Natural Knee and then on the European front principally in Central Europe the Innex Knee System. So we have great primary offerings, we have good (pre-TK) as well as revision opportunities as well and those aspects of our franchise are growing at attractive rates so it\u2019s really the primary side and its instrument driven and that\u2019s something that as I said we\u2019re going to be correcting out in short term here.", "Mike Duncan", "OK, great. And then did you talk about the trajectory of the U.S. trauma market now, historically it\u2019s been low double-digits. Do you think it\u2019s still that going forward or lower?", "David Dvorak", "I think that\u2019s at the same range currently, yes plus or minus a couple of percent of where it\u2019s been. So we haven\u2019t seen any significant change, but again when you have to look at our participation in that market with 5% market share and so we had a little bit more of a limited perspective on that particular market.", "Mike Duncan", "Great, thanks so much.", "David Dvorak", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.", "Bob Hopkins", "Hi thanks, can you hear me OK?", "James Crines", "We can Bob, good morning.", "Bob Hopkins", "Great good morning. Jim, I wanted to start with the comments around SG&A for 2010. I\u2019m just curious, should we be thinking of this 41 to 42% kind of range as the new structural norm going forward, or do you continue to anticipate that overtime, the structural norm is more backward it used to be in that 38 to 39% level.", "James Crines", "Yes, I would not categorize the 41 to 42% is the structural norm. I indicated we see some significant opportunities with respect to these new product launches and they are very significant. These are large systems that are getting launched both on the hip side and in trauma as well this year, that require us to make some investments in sales and marketing that support those product launches. So the 41 to 42% is not at all representative of the opportunity we believe we have to bring down that total spend over time and I would tell you that in part some of what we\u2019re spending money on this year is directed at putting systems in place at reengineering business processes that will ultimately drive savings in SG&A.", "And the savings combined with the opportunity we\u2019ll have to leverage fixed components of our SG&A expense as our top line grows, we\u2019re working combination to get us back to without putting a specific target to it, maybe perhaps an aspirational target at this point to get us back to that level that you referenced.", "Bob Hopkins", "OK, and then falling up for David I just curios, I mean it\u2019s the Zimmer docs your primary customers, is that a stable customer base at this point and you talked a little bit about the hip launch and some of the confidence here and getting back to market growth and even above market growth. But I\u2019m just wondering in light of the metal-on-metal controversy, is that if the confidence in that hip rollout been compromised in any way given what you\u2019re seeing from your surgeon base or given what you\u2019re seeing from metal-on-metal turns following the AAOS meeting?", "David Dvorak", "Bob, the surgeon base is largely stabilized, I mean there obviously isn\u2019t any magic to turning a calendar month or even a calendar year on those things and so it isn\u2019t going ever be a circumstance where all of that\u2019s over and past. There are going to be elements of that to continue on, but I will tell you they are immaterial to the overall performance of the business and frankly  I would characterize them as be much more in a norm of above (inaudible) you\u2019re going to win some business and you\u2019re going to lose some business overtime. So I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s a driving issue for our performance at this stage.", "As far as the hip launch goes, I don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s happening with metal-on-metal as at all inhibiting our ability to execute on the opportunity that we have with these new cup systems. We were always quiet low relative to the market in our share of that metal-on-metal side of the things, down around 5% relative to a market that was probably 25 to 30% as measured by dollars and maybe 20 to 25% is measured by units and some of the competitors had 50% or maybe even north of 50% in mix. So while there is likely to be some settling of the composition of the overall mix of metal within the hip cup offerings for the market.", "We have nothing but upside on that and we don\u2019t believe that that segment is going to go away within the market. So this is all a great opportunity for us and the versatility of those cup systems make that a non issue as well, because of the various varying surfaces that are offered globally.", "Bob Hopkins", "Great, thanks very much.", "David Dvorak", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Your next comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JP Morgan.", "Mike Weinstein", "Thanks, good morning. Two questions, first on the knee side and then on the hip side. So on the knee side that the rollout of the patient specific instruments, where are you in that rollout and how do we think about the spend in order for that to happen?", "David Dvorak", "The rollout of PSI, this is one that was cleared by just in late November of last year. So we\u2019re just getting to the point where you can start to see a bit of traction, right and this is one where it is likely to be a little bit of lag because you have to get those MRI centers qualified, surgeons trained very specifically and then the patients have to get into the queue as well even after that so there is going to be a lag between the efforts that go into that and productivity of those efforts and realizing sales and even enhancing primary knee sales which that system will certainly do and that\u2019s going to be just beginning of the second quarter, obviously didn\u2019t see anything in a way of a significant impact in the first quarter, but just to reiterate more of a second half of the year driver for growth.", "Mike Weinstein", "And then on the hip side, David the Continuum launch had a hit a speed bomb early on, it looks like you got some feedback that you\u2019re having \u2013 that surgeons were having some difficulty in planting the cup and then I saw that you had to recall the adapter liner which is part of the implementation process. So maybe if you can just spend a minute on that and then and give us a little bit of feedback on what you\u2019ve gotten?", "David Dvorak", "Yes and so that\u2019s why we do limited releases on these big systems and so you get the feedback and listen carefully to that feedback and then make whatever adjustments are necessary to optimize the performance of those instruments and that\u2019s exactly what the team did. So they got on that issue very early, its completely insignificant to the success of the ultimate launching of that product Mike in our view.", "And I wouldn\u2019t describe it is a speed bomb whatsoever its normal course correction and we jumped on it very early in the process and we\u2019re going to have a lot of success with that Continuum System.", "Mike Weinstein", "And so are you out there with a new adapter now?", "David Dvorak", "Yes.", "Mike Weinstein", "OK, thank you.", "David Dvorak", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Feinstein with Barclays Capital.", "Adam Feinstein", "Thank you, good morning everyone.", "David Dvorak", "Good morning.", "James Crines", "Good morning.", "Adam Feinstein", "I guess, I have a couple of questions here, just mainly just with your if you can talk a little bit about that, obviously it\u2019s been more challenging in Europe, at least off the more time looking at the U.S. market. So just curious if you can just give us some more color for what\u2019s going on there, and do you think that the back half of the year will start to see positive growth there as the comps get easier. So just curious to get your thoughts in terms of just what was going on there?", "David Dvorak", "Europe continues to be flat overall in the primary developed markets at this point in time, you see numbers around plus or minus a couple of percent or so in each of those markets but when you weight them out it looks like a very flat market for the large showings right now, there obviously are good growth opportunity still in those developing markets in Europe but they\u2019re not large enough to offset the flat nature of the large five within Europe.", "And so as we described in our prepared remarks we see stability in that in that, I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s getting worse. I think that its stable and so at some point clearly those markets are going to improve but it really involves a fair amount of speculation as to when that\u2019s going to occur because you\u2019re looking for a more fundamental recovery in some of those economies and freeing up some of those dollars that are controlled by those centralized healthcare systems for those patients that are deferring receiving the implants right now can get in and get the benefits of those solutions.", "And I still would project out the way we did in our guidance call earlier this year as far as Europe goes, and it\u2019s going to be flat to slightly positive.", "Adam Feinstein", "OK, great. And just a quick follow-up question here, more of a bigger picture question. So it\u2019s clearly things have picked up in the ortho business, you guys have done a good job in terms of the last of couple of years, you had some headwinds you were dealing with, things have turned, business is stable and growing again. So just, I guess the question is what\u2019s the next step if you will, is now the time where you will see more mergers taking place, do you think we\u2019ll see more consolidation, you guys did the Abbott Spine deal while back but just curious as you look forward, what\u2019s kind of the next big step outside of just a regular new product launches.", "David Dvorak", "Yes, and you\u2019re right I think that the primary focus for us right now is to ensure that our organic growth rate is very much on track and so that is all about the new product launches in the sales and marketing execution around those but beyond that we\u2019re constantly looking at business development opportunities for in exploring inorganic growth and we think that there are good opportunities, I think that you\u2019ll see more activity in that area as the economy stabilizes and people feel like they have greater clarity as to what those opportunities look like.", "So we\u2019re active in that area, it\u2019s the first priority as far as redeploying cash and we\u2019ll continue to be quite disciplined in how we go about that but I do think that you\u2019ll see activity levels across the industry pick up, I\u2019m not sure that those take the form of large consolidations, they\u2019re only a couple of potential opportunities of significance in that regard. So I won't speculate as to what others might be thinking about doing in that context but I do think that generally speaking this will be a healthier year for external development across the industry.", "Adam Feinstein", "OK, thank you very much.", "David Dvorak", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Leerink Swann.", "Rich Mynahan", "Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. This is actually Rich in for Rick.", "David Dvorak", "Hi Rich.", "Rich Mynahan", "I just had a couple of quick questions. On the patient specific knees, could you maybe just describe for me, I know you are little bit later than some of your competitors from the market, so you really haven\u2019t even seen most of the impacts on that yet on your business. But is this something that\u2019s applicable potentially to all knee procedures and across all of your platforms eventually and where do you kind of see this as in terms of penetration, across the industry and within your own product platform.", "David Dvorak", "I think that the application of these broader technologies of advanced instruments will certainly impact across all franchises. I think that this particular solution has some leveragability in other franchises, but I think that it will be augmented by other technologies that create more efficient reproducible procedure that give the surgeons even more confidence. So it\u2019s an area of import, I think that it\u2019s an area that we intent to improve and lead the industry in improving. As far as penetration rates, that is just going to depend upon the clinical success that people have with these procedures and importantly whether or not they solved some other challenges.", "There is going to be cost challenge, there is going to be a reimbursement challenge and an income challenge on the surgeons part and so all of those instrument advancements are going to have to be crafted in a way where they resolved multiple issues and create value and multiple contacts and that really will dictate what level of penetration but I think it\u2019s going to be significant in the intermediate term and the long term.", "Rich Mynahan", "Great, thanks. And then just on your extremities business. This is several quarters in a row, you guys have posted very strong growth rates, the market seems to be growing well there. I know and I believe you\u2019re mostly in the upper extremities arena. Just wondering if guys have any plans to expand in to the lower extremities for ankle and where you guys were on that front. Thanks a lot.", "David Dvorak", "We defined the sort of sweet spot for our business is being the musculoskeletal space, so that clearly is within space. There obviously are good reasons for us to want to expand into those types of markets, we have distribution channels to leverage, we have internal product development skill sets to leverage, we have manufacturing capabilities to leverage and so we think we can create a lot of value and anything that is within that musculoskeletal space that we currently are participating is of interesting to us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.", "Bill Carlo", "Hello guys.", "David Dvorak", "Hello.", "Bill Carlo", "It is (Bill Carlo) in for David Lewis today. Thanks for taking the questions.", "David Dvorak", "Sure.", "Bill Carlo", "Anyways, hoping that you guys I know you called a little bit already but if you could maybe give a little bit more color on strength and weakness in geographies outside the U.S., particularly how that may change across knees, hips, and spine?", "David Dvorak", "Well I think again, just start at the high level. We look at Asia Pacific and deem the procedure rates there to have returned for the most part pre-recession levels. And when you turn to Europe the five markets that we referenced clearly haven\u2019t done that yet. They stabilized but we haven\u2019t seen any improvement in those markets. And we have pretty significant market shares within those jurisdictions. So we feel like we have a fair amount of visibility.", "The outside of those five developed markets, we are seeing good growth in Europe and so there are opportunities there and surely the emerging markets when you define those as a dozen or 15 across the globe, we\u2019re seeing nice growth in all of those markets in those areas of emphasize for us is well.", "Bill Carlo", "OK, great. And I guess following up on that are there any significant differences you\u2019re seeing especially in the emerging markets across hips and knees or spine?", "David Dvorak", "We are seeing higher growth rates in what we define as an emerging markets. We track our performance across to total it about 13 markets, including the BRIC countries and we are seeing double-digit growth across those markets on what represents still a relatively small portion of our total revenue base.", "Bill Carlo", "OK. Thanks a lot. And then I know you\u2019ve already touched on this a little bit already, but just enough your current operating structure will allow you the flexibility to deliver on your way you can return to market growth rates. I guess to ask it in another way, is there any chance you would need to reinvest additional capital higher levels throughout the balance of the year to achieve that goal?", "David Dvorak", "It\u2019s all contemplated by our guidance. Those plans are well developed and we\u2019re executing to those plans and to the extent that there would be accelerated spending that would largely be driven by an expanded, still expanded viewpoint as to what the opportunity looks like, so I think that you can assume that that is all baked into our guidance.", "Bill Carlo", "Alright, thanks a lot.", "David Dvorak", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Credit Suisse.", "Katherine", "Hi it\u2019s actually (Katherine) for Kristen. I just have a couple of questions on mix. Can you tell us whether the U.S. net mix price was negative or positive for hips and knees this quarter?", "James Crines", "Yes, when we look at that in the aggregate, for the quarter a very slight positive.", "Katherine", "And for both hips and knees in the quarter.", "James Crines", "Again just looking at it in the aggregate for both hips and knees that\u2019s right.", "Katherine", "OK, so worldwide. Alright, so and also what are you assuming I guess in your guidance in terms of the mix contribution?", "James Crines", "Yes, what we said coming into the year, that our expectation with respect to fewer price first of all would be that we would see something in the order of minus one to minus 2% across all of our product franchises and that positive mix that would offset that. So for the year, our expectation is that it will be neutral and that hasn\u2019t changed.", "Katherine", "OK, and then quickly can you break out the U.S. dental growth?", "James Crines", "We on the\u2026", "Katherine", "Just trying to see if the \u2013 if there is any improvements sequentially?", "James Crines", "Its low single digits, positive.", "Katherine", "OK, and then lastly on Japan pricing, are you still estimating at about 4 to 5% impact?", "James Crines", "That\u2019s exactly right for us, that will be the impact.", "Katherine", "OK, great. Thank you.", "David Dvorak", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Good morning and thanks for taking the question.", "David Dvorak", "Good morning.", "Joanne Wuensch", "(OSP) product line very \u2013 did very well this quarter, I know it\u2019s a small portion of your business, but can we anticipate a nice recovery over the next several quarter, is this reflective of new products or just simply a sales force getting up together over easier comps?", "David Dvorak", "Well the re-launching of the products that were taken off the market is a big growth driver and so we\u2019re executing well I will tell you on that front, 60 plus percent growth in some of those categories, but it isn\u2019t just that aspect the (OSP) business that is performing well, we\u2019re doing quite well in bone cement and accessories, we\u2019re doing well with our (tuner kits). So it\u2019s pretty broad base and the next for us there Joanne is to make sure that we have a good product development Cadence coming out, so that we sustain that growth, but right now it\u2019s really driven by good execution of bone cement, of (tuner kits) and then the re-launching of those products that were off the market previously.", "Joanne Wuensch", "And for clarification purposes forgive me, your head loses they go through, did they go through COGS, they go through and impact your gross margins?", "David Dvorak", "They do.", "Joanne Wuensch", "OK, thank you. And then just a final question, in the area of spine, I understand Dynesys is a problem here in the United States, but is this a matter of just getting more feed on the street and more products in the bag or is there something else that would be necessary to get this area moving in a positive direction?", "David Dvorak", "Well we have a full portfolio at this point in time, but obviously it\u2019s always a matter of getting more (critics) on the bag and more feed on the street. We have what we deem to be a platform business there and we would execute better with what we have but it needs to grow and we\u2019re going to have to continue to invest to be a player with any critical mass within that stage.", "So I would tell you right now I think that its new product development in sales and marketing execution that gets us back on track but then we\u2019re going to be continuously investing in that business to get it back at a market growth very.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Thank you very much.", "David Dvorak", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein.", "Derrick Sung", "Hi good morning. You mentioned in your comments that you saw sort of the U.S. volume demand also is returning to pre-recession levels. I was wondering if you could put some color around that by maybe running through each of the businesses and kind of giving us the sense for where they are in terms of volumes respective to pre-recession levels?", "David Dvorak", "Derrick if we look back at 2007, 2008 growth rates for we\u2019re really principally focused on the hips and knees. We saw those categories, those product franchises across the market growing in high single digits and we look at least what we understand with respect to the first quarter at this stage with the companies that are reported publicly, we see growth rates that are back in at that level with knees obviously being higher than hips, but we\u2019re seeing a return again how we would characterize it to high single digit growth for hips and knees in the U.S. market.", "Derrick Sung", "OK, and in terms of \u2013 and you had I think previously talked about deferred procedures and anecdotes about deferred procedures that you have been hearing from your surgeons early through 2009 during the recession. Can you comment on kind of what you\u2019re hearing now about that from your customer base?", "David Dvorak", "Well I\u2019m sorry that we had always indicated an expectation that the impact of those patients eventually working their way back into the system would be somewhat modest in what occurred in a kind of a linear fashion over time, that is we believe still the case. Anecdotally in pockets that you do hear that certain surgeons particularly those that perhaps are do less volume typically are getting a bit busier and so it is the case that those patients maybe coming back, but in the aggregates we don\u2019t see that adding significant points of growth in those hip and knee markets within the U.S.", "Derrick Sung", "OK, so is it fair to say that kind of your view of market is that they\u2019re kind of where they are today, they are kind of their back where they were before and so you wouldn\u2019t expect any further acceleration from kind of what you\u2019re seeing today based on your sort of knowledge of the market?", "David Dvorak", "Yes, I\u2019d say that\u2019s fair with respect to the Americas and the Asia Pacific markets, we would expect to still see a recovery at some point in Europe, Middle East, Africa markets which are still a bit depressed.", "Derrick Sung", "OK, thank you. And on your knee specifically in the U.S., the functional growth rates tick down by few points versus the fourth quarter, this quarter. Is there any reasons for that, that you can point to?", "David Dvorak", "We\u2019re in the middle of executing a fair amount of work right now to get things setup for these product launches but I don\u2019t think that there is anything that should be interpreted in a way of a trend there or a significant issue of any sort.", "Derrick Sung", "OK, and then lastly in trauma, one of your competitors had mentioned bad weather about in the U.S. and in Europe being positive for overall trauma volumes this quarter. It doesn\u2019t look like we saw that near numbers. Is there any reasons for that that you can think of?", "David Dvorak", "Again I can't point to anything but again we have 5% market share and so a larger competitor may have a better basis to be able to characterize those types of dynamics.", "Derrick Sung", "OK, great. Thank you very much.", "David Dvorak", "OK, you\u2019re very welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray. Mr. Miksic, your line is open.", "Matt Miksic", "Hi this is Matt.", "David Dvorak", "Hello Matt.", "Matt Miksic", "Thanks for taking the questions. So a follow-up on some of the new product launches that you have going, I just \u2013 I wanted to get a sense you talked about I think other manufactures have talked about mix obviously price tougher in this environment. As you rollout these new products we know that orthopedics launches have always taken a good amount of time to pick up speed as focus about these you get the instruments out in the field you need to sell on. Is that a dynamic that you feel in this market either because of the (DOJ) or because of hospital pressure or something is extending further? Are (docs) little bit more conservative now than it were a couple of years ago about picking up new products and adopting new products you\u2019re rolling out?", "David Dvorak", "I don\u2019t believe so Matt, I think that as you said its been a dynamic for some period of time in these rollouts and there is a lot to mobilize in a way of effort and obviously a large goal is on the manufacturing and operation side that you\u2019ve been -- get these instrument sets and implant sets manufactured and deployed and then surgeon training that goes along with that is significant, obviously the sales force training even in advance of that is significant and so that\u2019s really what we\u2019re seeing here.", "But I wouldn\u2019t tell you that this field is different than other large launches from the past, that kind of six to 18 months time frame to seed the market and start to see some productivity and find traction is still what this one feels like at this point in time. They get early feedback on these products but as we\u2019ve said the early feedback in all jurisdiction whether its early stage of the launch or later stage in terms of months for the (OUS) launches with these products has been very positive for us.", "Matt Miksic", "OK, and then so six to 18 months still the window for getting those kind of up to full head of steam or something we would see in the numbers.", "David Dvorak", "That\u2019s fair.", "Matt Miksic", "And then one follow-up on the dental market. I may have missed any comments you made specific to how things were going there, but any color you can provide on what you\u2019re seeing in the market, how much of the growth that you\u2019re seeing is sort of an improvement in your later mater or do you think you\u2019re gaining share notable products. Any kind of color would be great?", "David Dvorak", "Great, and this will tell you that I think on the general environment I would characterize it more as stabilizing a bit as opposed to restoration of pre-recession growth rates and obviously isn\u2019t at that little at this point in time. So stability looks attractive relatively speaking to where that market has been over the last couple of years since the recession took affect and I think that that\u2019s more of a driver, beyond that one quarter a trend does not make I think that we have a good management team out there and they are stabilizing their business and executing well and that\u2019s a business in a market that we\u2019re very interested in growing. So we\u2019re going to be in a good position when there is a more full recovery and that will come but it hasn\u2019t come yet Matt.", "Matt Miksic", "Alright, well thanks for taking the questions.", "David Dvorak", "You\u2019re very welcome.", "Paul Blair", "(Celeste), in the interest of time, let's take one more question please.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Matt Dodds with Citi Bank.", "Jimmy", "Hello.", "David Dvorak", "Hello.", "Jimmy", "Yes, hi this is (Jimmy) calling in for Matt.", "David Dvorak", "Hi there.", "Jimmy", "Hi, so I was wondering you gave consolidated pricing, I was wondering if you could break it out to hips, knees and spine.", "James Crines", "Sure, so hips pricing for the quarter was down just over a point and knees as well, pricing was down just over a point in the quarter and spine pricing was flat for the quarter.", "Jimmy", "OK, and then at AAOS there was some negative data that was published on the NexGen, yes I was wondering if you could comments on what the feedback was amongst the surgeons regarding that data?", "David Dvorak", "That \u2013 it is a knee system that we\u2019re very comfortable with, I will tell you that we\u2019ve had great success with that system. We re-review investigative data and since the launching of that system the revision rates have been very low, so we don\u2019t have concerns at this point as to performance of the product, the design of that product and we\u2019ll continue to monitor it as we do with our other products but I will tell you that within the quarter is measured by the sales performance within that product line, it didn\u2019t produce any issues for us. It grew at an attractive rate.", "Jimmy", "OK, that\u2019s all I had. Thanks guys.", "David Dvorak", "Great, thank you. Well thanks again everyone for joining us today and for your continued interest in Zimmer, we look forward to speaking to you on our second quarter conference call 8 A.M. on July 22, 2010. At this point I\u2019ll turn the call back to you (Celeste).", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Good morning. I am Paul Blair, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zimmer. I would like to welcome you to the Zimmer Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today to host this call are David Dvorak, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Crines, Executive Vice President, Finance, and Chief Financial Officer. This morning we will review our performance for the second quarter, provide you with an update on certain key matters, present an update on our outlook for 2010 and conclude our discussion with a question-and-answer session. We understand that this is a very busy reporting day and we'll do our best to keep today's call close to an hour in length. Therefore, we ask that participants to pose one question with one follow up to allow as many callers as possible the opportunity to take part in today's call. ", "Before we get started, I would like to point out that this presentation contains forward-looking statements within the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the orthopedics industry, management's beliefs and assumptions made by management. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. For a list and description of the risks and uncertainties, see the disclosure materials filed by Zimmer with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ", "Zimmer disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, further events or otherwise. ", "This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of such information to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, along with other financial and statistical information for the periods to be presented on this conference call was included in the press release announcing our earnings, which may be accessed from the Zimmer website at www.zimmer.com under the section entitled Investor Relations.", "In addition, we routinely post important information for investors on our website in the Investor Relations section. We intend to use this website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and for complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Accordingly, investors should monitor the Investor Relations section of our website in addition to following our press releases, SEC filings, public conference calls, presentations and webcasts. ", "A rebroadcast of this call will be available from approximately two hours following the conclusion of today's call through the end of the day on August 5, 2010, and can also be accessed from the Investor Relations section of the Zimmer website. ", "At this time, I\u2019d like to introduce David Dvorak, President and Chief Executive Officer of Zimmer.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone, and welcome. We're glad you could join us for today's call. This morning, I will review our second quarter and first half 2010 results. Jim will then provide additional financial details. ", "Throughout the first six months of 2010, we've continued to perform in line with our expectations entering the year, demonstrating year-over-year constant-currency sales growth across all geographic segments. We've made progress with new product introductions, particularly in our Hip business, and we expect these additions, along with our new instrument offerings in Knees will increasingly contribute to revenues in the second half of the year.", "Net sales for the quarter were $1.06 billion, an increase of 3.3% on a constant-currency basis, and our earnings per share were $1.09 on an adjusted basis. For the quarter, the Americas region grew sales 2.8% constant currency compared to the prior year. The Asia-Pacific segment grew 6.5%. And despite a continued challenging market, our Europe, Middle East and Africa region improved its sales performance with 2.8% growth. Knee sales for the quarter improved year-over-year, 3% on a constant-currency basis, reflecting positive volume and mix of 4.5%, less negative price of 1.5%.", "To accelerate our growth in the Knee franchise, we've launched several strategic initiatives to reinforce the strength and performance of our Knee systems, which we believe will also help to gain new customers. We continue to see growth in our patient-specific instruments as more physicians seek opportunities to optimize the accuracy of their surgical cases, as well as enhance their operative inefficiency with these MRI-based surgical guides. Along with patient-specific instruments, we plan to deploy our posterior referencing instruments in the second half of this year, following the developer release that took place this past quarter. ", "Posterior referencing instruments offer physicians, who subscribe to the surgical philosophy, access to our clinically proven NexGen implant. Early trial results have been encouraging as these instruments have been favorably received by posterior referencing positions. ", "Hip sales for the second quarter improved year-over-year 2.6% on a constant-currency basis, reflecting positive volume and mix of 4.2% less negative price of 1.6%. Adoption of our newly launched Continuum System Acetabular products continues to progress, and we anticipate sales of these products will positively impact our performance in the second half of the year. The Continuum System, combined the best of Zimmer's proven Hip technologies and further reinforces our commitment to providing an integrated line of polyethylene, ceramic and metal bearing options that more closely match the unique needs and lifestyles of patients.", "Growth in the second quarter was supported by our Fitmore and M/L Taper with connective technology stems, which we firmly believe represents the industry's most versatile Hip System. The Fitmore Stem experienced 56% sales growth compared to the prior year as its bone preservation attributes continued to be favored by many surgeons and patients. Sales of our M/L Taper with connective technology grew 31% in the quarter compared to last year. This product offers the surgeons superior interoperative flexibility with its independent adjustment of labeling, offset and version to match a wide range of patient anatomies. Positive performance across our Hip business is reflected by the 160 basis points of incremental growth over the first quarter.", "Extremities posted solid results for the quarter with sales growth of 13% constant currency, due in large part to the success of our Trabecular Metal products sold in United States. Noteworthy product lines were the Trabecular Metal Reverse Shoulder with 31% second quarter sales growth, and the Trabecular Metal Glenoid, which doubled its sales compared to the same period in the prior year. ", "Our Dental business reported another solid quarter as well, with sales increasing 7.7% constant currency. Following last year's weak demand fueled by global economic uncertainty, we believe our two successive quarters of growth reflect a stabilizing trend in this sector, as well as a nice performance from our Dental team. The Americas contributed 8.7% growth and sales in Europe increased 10.6% constant currency over the prior year quarter. Earlier this month, Zimmer Dental launched Zimmer Collagen Capsules and Wedge, the first-ever bone shaping membranes for dental graft containment during sinus lifts, socket repair and preservation procedures.", "Trauma sales in the second quarter were up over the prior year 1% constant currency. The global rollout of our Natural Nail System continue with our recently released Cephalomedullary Nail. The second quarter also marked the first implantation of our NCB Periprosthetic Plating System, the first compress of solution for addressing complex femoral fractures around the area of a knee or hip implant. The rollout of this product will continue throughout the remainder of 2010.", "Our Spine business has been through a series of operational challenges over the past few quarters, and we recorded a sales decrease of 9.2% constant currency in the second quarter. As we negotiate the challenging reimbursement landscape and continue to focus on improved sales execution, we anticipate performance will begin to stabilize. ", "We continue to make steady progress in our Orthopaedic Surgical Products franchise. We reported 14.6% constant-currency growth, supported by 56% sales growth in Wound Debridement and 13% sales growth in the wound cement and accessories category, both on a constant-currency basis.", "Before handing off to Jim, I'll briefly touch on a few final topics. Regarding the overall market, while there did appear to be a modest step-down in growth during the second quarter, we believe that the broader market dynamics are unchanged. Looking at the first half of the year, based on a majority of the market having reported second quarter results, it appears that worldwide reconstructive growth is actually up about 1% compared to the full year growth in 2009. Moreover, the fundamental drivers for attractive growth within the musculoskeletal markets have not changed. ", "Turning to the European market. Our performance in this a geographic segment remains in line with our expectations coming into the year. Although government spending controls continue to contribute to challenging market conditions in Europe overall, we're not seeing further market deterioration, and we're encouraged by our performance during the quarter. ", "With regard to pricing, consolidated average selling prices in the second quarter were down 0.9% compared to the prior year period. We experienced negative pricing of 1.1% in Americas, positive pricing in our Europe, Middle East and Africa region of 0.4%, and negative pricing in the Asia-Pacific region of 2.4%, driven largely by the price cuts in Japan. Consolidated pricing for the second quarter was consistent with our expectations, and we continue to anticipate moderate price erosion of negative 1% to negative 2% for the year. With respect to guidance, as we discussed in our earnings release this morning, we're reaffirming our outlook for 2010. ", "Finally, we announced this morning that Zimmer has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Beijing Montagne Medical Devices Co. Ltd. The agreement contains certain closing conditions, and we anticipate consummating the acquisition in late 2010 or early 2011. Montagne is a China-based manufacturer and distributor of orthopaedic implants with annual revenues of approximately $10 million. This acquisition would make Zimmer the leading provider of reconstructive orthopaedic solutions in China. We're excited about this opportunity to expand our presence in a vital emerging market for the industry.", "Jim will now provide further details on the quarter and on our guidance. Jim?", "James Crines", "Thanks, David. I will review our performance in the quarter in more detail and then provide additional information related to our 2010 guidance. ", "Our total revenues for the quarter, as David mentioned, were $1,058,000,000, a 3.3% constant-currency improvement compared to the second quarter of last year. Our tailwind from the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen offset a headwind from the euro in the quarter, resulting in a slightly positive impact from foreign currency translation, which increased revenues by 0.4% or $4 million in the quarter. Our adjusted gross profit margin of 76.3% for the quarter reflects improvements in operating efficiency and the recognition of gains on currency hedge contracts. The margin ratio is down 70 basis points compared to second quarter 2009 but increased 140 basis points compared with the first quarter. We are now expecting our gross margin ratio to be between 76% and 76.5% for the full year. These expectations include an assumption that foreign currency exchange rates remain at recent levels. ", "Moving down the income statement, R&D expense, as a percentage of sales, was at 5.2%. And that $55.1 million for the quarter is 10.5% higher on a total dollar basis when compared to the prior year. This increase is in line with our plans for the year, as we begin to accelerate our new product development programs in the second quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $437 million in the second quarter and at 41.4% of sales or 100 basis point below prior year. SG&A, as a percentage of sales, is now anticipated to be approximately 42% for the full year, as our outlook is negatively impacted by a change in foreign currency exchange rates and the higher product liability expenses incurred in the first quarter.", "We expect SG&A expense to increase to around 43.5% of sales in the third quarter due to seasonality. Typically, the third quarter SG&A expense, as a percentage of sales, represents the high watermark for the year due to the summer slowdown of procedure volumes. During the second quarter, the company recorded a provision of $75 million for known and anticipated claims related to the Durom Cup. Zimmer's estimate for these claims now include worldwide revisions associated with surgeries predating the 2008 temporary U.S. suspension. Adjusted 2010 figures exclude the impact of this provision. The total provision for all claims to include those that were expensed in the normal course is now $222 million. This estimated contingent liability is based on a two-year pattern of claims made. Prior estimates were necessarily based on a smaller data set of claims made and the shorter time series. An independent actuarial model was also used to assist in determining an appropriate level of approval for these claims. Any claims received outside of the defined timeframe are managed in the normal course and are reflected in our standard quarterly product liability accruals.", "Continuing down the income statement, acquisition integration realignment and other amounted to, $11.5 million in the quarter and includes one-time cost for realignment of our global IT infrastructure and other charges related to prior-period acquisitions. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased to $315 million, a 29.7%, our adjusted operating profit per sales ratio is 10 basis points lower than the prior year second quarter, as the anticipated decrease in gross margin was offset by leverage in SG&A. Net interest expense for the quarter amounted to $14.3 million compared to $4 million in the prior-year quarter. Similar to the first quarter, the change is primarily due to the $1 billion senior unsecured notes offering we completed in November of 2009. Adjusted net earnings were $221 million for the second quarter, an increase of 2.6% compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $1.09 on $203 million average outstanding diluted shares. These adjusted earnings per share are inclusive of approximately $0.06 of share-based compensation. At $0.82 reported diluted earnings per share, which include the items reflected in certain claims and acquisition, integration, realignment and other, decreased 16.3% from the prior year second quarter reported EPS of $0.98. ", "Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.4%, slightly below the first quarter as a result of the favorable resolution of certain tax positions. We still anticipate a 2010 full year tax rate of approximately 27%.", "During the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares at a full purchase price of $85 million. As of June 30, 2010, approximately $32 million remained authorized under $1.25 billion repurchase program, which expires at the end of 2010. The company had approximately 201 million shares of common stock outstanding as of June 30, 2010, down from $204 million as of December 31, 2009. Our Board has approved an additional $1.5 billion stock repurchase program, which expires December 31, 2013. We continually review the best utilization of the cash that we generate. Our intentions with regard to use of free cash flow remain the same as we have indicated for some time. Our first priority is external development, when and if the right opportunities arise, to add technology, products or businesses that strategically align with our focus on musculoskeletal health. We balance this priority with maintaining strong liquidity and continue to believe that share repurchases are an efficient and effective way to return excess free cash flow to our shareholders. ", "Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $273 million, up nearly 40% from $195 million in the second quarter of 2009. Our focused efforts on managing our working capital have allowed us to offset significant investments to build out the inventory pipeline for Acetabular Cup and Intramedullary Nail new product launches. This quarter, we continue to carefully manage inventory levels with our global distribution network. Inventories were $10 million below first quarter at $886 million. As a consequence, adjusted inventory days on hand finished the quarter at 318 days, a decrease of 57 days compared to the second quarter of 2009. ", "Our adjusted trade accounts receivable days sales outstanding finished the quarter at 61 days, a decrease of two days from the second quarter of 2009. Depreciation and amortization expense for the second quarter amounted to $81 million. Free cash flow in the second quarter was $214 million, $73 million higher than the second quarter of 2009. We define free cash flow as operating cash flow less cash outflows for instruments and property plant and equipment. ", "Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $58.9 million, including $43.7 million for instruments and $15.2 million for property plant and equipment. We expect capital expenditure to be higher in the second half of the year as we make significant investments in our new posterior referencing knee instruments, continue to deploy instruments in support of our previously mentioned new product launches and replace machinery and equipment in the normal course. Cash outlays associated with investing activity during the quarter include $4.1 million for certain international distributor acquisitions. ", "I'd like to turn now to our guidance for 2010. In our earnings release this morning, we reaffirmed our full year constant-currency sales and adjusted earnings per share guidance. Full year revenues are expected to increase between 3% and 5% on a constant-currency basis. Assuming foreign currency exchange rates remain near recent levels, we estimate that foreign currency translation will decrease revenues by 0.5% for the full year 2010, resulting in expected revenue growth on a reported basis between 2.5% and 4.5%. For the third and fourth quarters, we anticipate foreign currency translation will decrease revenues by approximately 2% and 5%, respectively. ", "Adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be in a range of $4.15 to $4.35 for the full year 2010. Additionally, with respect to the third quarter, we believe, based on a review of published independent analysts earnings models for Zimmer that seasonal revenue and expense patents are not fully reflected in those models. Also, new product and instrument deployments will progressively ramp up and are expected to have a greater impact on revenues in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. Taking into account the anticipated effects of seasonality and other factors, we expect that our third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share will be between $0.93 and $0.98. ", "David, I'll turn the call back over to you.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you, Jim. Our performance in the second quarter and year-to-date has been in line with our expectations coming into 2010, reflected by top line constant-currency growth across all three of our geographic segments. We continue to progress on operational improvements as reflected in our higher gross margin and lower SG&A ratios compared with our first quarter results. This allowed us to accelerate R&D spending and still deliver solid earnings and strong cash flow. ", "As the year progresses, further penetration of recently-launched products will complement our established key product lines. We're encouraged by early adoption rates and clinical feedback for our new Acetabular Cup offerings, patient-specific instruments and Natural Nail line. Further, we're confident that the actions we're taking will accelerate our short-term performance and build upon the foundation for our longer-term strategic plans. ", "And now I'd like to ask Regina to begin the Q&A portion of our call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Adam Feinstein with Barclays Capital.", "Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital", "Just wanted to get some more thoughts here. Obviously, you guys showed some stable trends. The market was very concerned about Europe during the quarter, but it seems like things were fine there. You provided some comments before that you feel comfortable with it. Can you just give us some more specific feedback in terms of just whatever your analysis is telling you? And just curious in terms of just specific countries and as such? But just wanted to see how you guys could get comfortable and just so we could better understand the trends.", "David Dvorak", "What we're seeing, Adam, is consistency in those markets. And as we said before, when you concentrate on the five major markets there, they are flat. Some of them are a couple of points down. Some of them are maybe a couple of points up, but they wash up to be in relatively flat within that space. That isn't as descriptive of the other markets, the more developing markets where there is more attractive growth presently. So we do think that this is a continued trend. It's a relatively stabilized trend over the last several quarters. And as you can see, we produced positive results in that context. So I think that our performance is improving in Europe at this point in time. I think that the market is relatively stable, and we still firmly believe that the long-term growth prospects of those developed markets, the larger ones, would improve over time with greater economic stability.", "Operator", "Our next question comes the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Jim, can you maybe just walk us through on a little bit more detail on the margin and sequential uptick from the 74.9% and the 76.3%, how much of that is related to product mix versus FX hedging gain? Can you quantify me the breakout of the two?", "James Crines", "Sure. With the FX, basically, the gains that were recognized in hedge contracts contribute to about half of the improvement in margin quarter-over-quarter and the balance of that improvement really comes from the improvements that we've seen in operating efficiency. So in the first half of this year, our manufacturing facilities were operating at or near optimal levels of capacity utilization, in contrast to what we were talking about in the back half of last year. So this has allowed us to put lower cost inventories to the shelf in the first half. And in addition, our efforts to reduce core inventories as we build out the pipeline of new product inventory has resulted in lower obsolescence charges. Currency, as we look at the balance of the year, currencies has a relatively modest to the positive impact. It's really these other factors that are the principal drivers to the anticipated improvement.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "So if I take out FX from here, our gross margins were, I guess, about 75.6% in the quarter. Is that the right number off of which to build the go-forward gross margin assumption if we want to make estimates with respect to volume and mix going forward from here? Should we view that 75.6% as a baseline on an operational basis?", "James Crines", "So I'll tell you what, there are a number of factors that impact our gross margin including product mix, currency, inventory obsolescence, capacity utilization, just to name a few. So that's something we'll certainly have a more studied view on as we close out 2010 and be prepared to discuss that on our fourth quarter call.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "David, maybe you could follow up on your comments with respect to margin. Just doing some math, looking at who's reported so far, it looks like the U.S. market recon Hips and Knees flowed about 300 basis points sequentially and international flowed between 150 to 200 basis points. Can you maybe just address the U.S. in a little bit more detail? J&J talked a little bit of that increased pricing pressure. Can you maybe help us gape what you think is happening there?", "David Dvorak", "We didn't see much change in the way of pricing pressure, David. But clearly, there was a stepdown in both Hips and Knees in the reported second quarter numbers. I think that there could be some billing day impacts across of the other companies within the industry that contributed to that, that may have led people to believe that the first quarter market numbers were a bit higher than they actually were. And from my perspective, I think they really want to look at the first half of the year as opposed to isolating the second quarter on a stand-alone basis. A little bit more profound of a stepdown on the U.S. side in Knees. And I think that there was a bit of a procedural stepdown. I will tell you that very anecdotally, we saw a bit more of that in the earlier interventions. So the new knees [ph]  and Cruciate Retaining knees as opposed to the posterior stabilized knees. So that might be indicative of people in that younger category deferring the procedures at this point in year or making some decisions as impacted by the health of the economy in general, but very anecdotal at this point in time. And I wouldn't read too much into that one quarter result.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with UBS.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS Investment Bank", "Dave, just following up on David's question, we look at the ex-U.S. market Q1 to Q2, there were differences between Hips and Knees across the quarters. But in aggregate, on a constant-currency basis, it looked pretty similar. What's your sense of that?", "David Dvorak", "Consistent with what you just described, Bruce, I think that there's -- there looked like a little bit of an OUS step-up in Hips, and a little bit of a step-down in Knees and they largely wash one other out. I mean, that's logical in the sense of as everyone has described, in the industry, there was a more significant price cut in Japan applicable to Knees than there was to Hips. That so that can be part of the explanation for that.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS Investment Bank", "And Dave, just thinking about Spine, and I know you're not a huge player on Spine, just to get a little more granular on the nature of the pressure in the market, is it more about surgeries being denied or delayed or not approved quickly or rather per case reimbursement at the payer level or just the hospitals are negotiating harder with unchanged commercial reimbursement because it's largely a commercially insured population? If you can just give us some indication of what your sense of what's going on there, it would be great.", "David Dvorak", "Bruce, the dynamic you've described are all in play. And I think that there are different elements that would apply to a greater or lesser extent to the different companies, depending upon their market positions. As it applies to us, obviously, the reimbursement issues are much more profound with respect to our U.S. Dynesys business at this point in time. And so that's where we're seeing the most pressure. In the general market, where we're seeing some of what you described, but I don't know that I would describe that as being profoundly impacting our results as opposed to what's happening with Dynesys there. And then when it comes to pricing, we're not seeing as much pressure as some of the others are discussing. But again, I think that, that's probably consistent with our market position. And again, all of those comments need to be interpreted and read in the context of a company with far less market share than some of the others that you're talking to.", "Operator", "Our next question comes the line of Michael Weinstein with JP Morgan.", "Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "First question, I just want to clarify on the commentary on the SG&A line for the third quarter, Jim. It's looking like you're expecting, after getting a really good quarter of leverage, we'd expect not to go the other way in the third quarter and you tied it to seasonality. But there seems to be a bit of a disconnect there so could you explain it?", "James Crines", "I think if you go back, Mike, over the last several years, you would see that, that's pretty consistent with the seasonal patterns that we've reported in the past because those costs are largely fixed over the short run with some limited exceptions to where we have sales organizations that are fully commissioned. The SG&A expenses did not drop at the same rate as our sales tend to kind of decline relative to the first quarter as procedure volumes slow down as surgeons take vacations over those summer months, so really is a function of seasonality. And what we're projecting is very consistent with what we've reported in the past.", "Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then Jim, the decision to maintain the guidance, you had some EPS upside this quarter and your guidance is still pretty wide ranged in the bottom line for the year. Why not narrow that down a little bit at this point?", "James Crines", "Mike, as we said before, we come in to the year with a range. We feel very comfortable operating within that range. And as far as the bottom line goes, it's very dependent clearly on what happens on the top line. We're in an operating period where we see significant opportunities around these new product launches. The timing, the ramp-up, all of that is obviously not all that predictable. So that sort of lead us to the range that we've provided. As we indicated or I indicated in my prepared remarks, that ramp-up really just begins to take effect in the second half of this year. So we feel still appropriate to maintain the range that we're operating with and came out with from the beginning of the year.", "Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "David, how would you describe where you think you are in the rollout of the new Hip lines? Do you think you're -- at what point do you think you are in the conversion [ph], at what point do you think you are in the full rollout of those products and the timing of this and the impact on the business?", "David Dvorak", "Good question because it's so important, as Jim described, the expectations for the second half of the year performance, Mike. And I would tell you that I believe that we're just entering the traction period with respect to the rollout of the Acetabular Cups. We're six months into it, so they are not set. They're deployed in the key markets, at least, at this point in time to where we're starting to see traction. We actually saw 0.5 of improvement in our Hip performance in the second quarter. So we're just entering the period, and you have great visibility and a lot of contextual understanding for what these rollouts look like and the time horizons. You kind of look at these things and say for six months, you shouldn't expect much. After six months, you should start to expect something. And you're really in that traction point, I would say, from six to 18 or 24 months of rolling these things out. So we're just entering the period where we should start to see traction and pickup.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.", "Robert Hopkins", "So just to follow up on Mike's question, as it relates to your global Hip growth over the next couple of quarters, is it fair to say then that you think you will see accelerating constant currency growth trends in Q3 and Q4 relative to the 3% that you saw here in the second quarter?", "David Dvorak", "We do think that we're going to make progress on the Hip side in the second half of the year. I will tell you that I think that more of that progress on the Hip side is going to come from the Americas and Asia-Pacific geographic market initially just because of some of the environmental circumstances affecting the European market. And it's also important to note that you lose a billing day in Europe in the third quarter. So subject to those comments, yes, Bob, we'll see a pickup in our Hip growth.", "Robert Hopkins", "And then same kind of question on the Knee side. You made some comments about knees in your prepared remarks. And I'm just curious, do you have confidence in where you are right now that we should expect again an uptick in constant currency growth rates in the back half of the year relative to what you saw in the second quarter?", "David Dvorak", "We do, and I will tell you that in that circumstance in particular, the opportunities geographically are a little bit flipped. I think that there's a bit more momentum and opportunity to improve in Europe in Q3 than some of the other geographic segments. And then I think as we get into the fourth quarter, we're going to see more significant ramp-up due to the deployment of those new instruments in markets that would include the United States. So that's the pattern. The deployments, as it apply to Hips, are not at the same stage sitting here today as they are on the Acetabular Cups for hips. So I think our Knee instrument-driven growth is going to be a little bit more back-end loaded in the year than Hips.", "Robert Hopkins", "And then just for Jim, real quick. Regarding the third quarter, you gave some specific guidance on EPS. If you said it on top line, I missed it. Consensus, I think, is a little over $1 billion. Was there a specific number you had in mind for the third quarter?", "James Crines", "I did not provide a specific number or guidance on third quarter revenues, Bob, other than to provide some color around what the effect of the change in our currency outlook is going to be in the third quarter, where we indicated that we expect that to be at minus 2% in the third quarter and minus 5% in the fourth quarter. But beyond that, we have not provided specific revenue guidance for Q3.", "Robert Hopkins", "On the SG&A leverage side, I do understand some of the dynamics about what's going on in the third quarter. But from a longer-term perspective, is there any change to the comments you've said historically about the potential over time to get back down and normalize SG&A levels when you look at Zimmer historically? Has there been any change in your mind on that thought?", "James Crines", "Yes, I'll respond to that. It's a very good question. I indicated in my prepared remarks our SG&A expenses for the quarter were 100 basis points below prior year. So clearly, we showed some progress in the quarter. And this is in an operating period where, as you know, we are investing to support of significant new product launches. So we are making progress. But from this point, a stronger dollar relative to prior operating period does create a headwind for the SG&A ratio because a significant portion of our expenses are dollar-based. So as for the outlook for SG&A, longer term, we obviously have more work to do as we acknowledge on the first quarter. We don't consider 42% to be a structural norm. We're not happy with those expenses being at that level, and our plans over the long term are to bring that down through a combination of business process, reengineering and through leveraging our fixed costs as our top line grows.", "Operator", "Our next question comes the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "The first one is, as we've heard a number of companies and managements talk about the hip and the knee market growth rate in the mid single digits, could you toss your hat in the ring and comment on what you think, not just this year or even maybe next year, but longer term the overall health and growth rate this market could look like?", "David Dvorak", "Well, I think that, that is the right way to think about the market, Joanne, in the current context. We exited the year right at that point, say 5% in the fourth quarter. The full year 2009 looked like it was a point lower than that. And so now if you look at the first half of this year on the large joint side, again, it looks dead in the middle of that range. So mid single digits, right at 5-ish%. But I think the thing that is important to remember is you have some big markets that are suppressing that number, primarily those developed markets in Europe at this point in time and significant price pressure as it applies to Japan, in particular, at this point in time. And so these procedures are getting deferred in Europe and the developed markets to be sure, and those are going to come back at some point in time. And so you will see some procedural uptick from that dead middle single digits. Furthermore, I think that we continue to believe that there is mixed opportunity on top of that procedural growth. And we think that, that mixed opportunity, as we've discussed in the past, if you want to put numbers to it is, is in a range of say 1% to 3%. So right now, we would suspect that in general, those mixed opportunities are washing out the downward price pressure, pure price pressure. And so if the economy stabilizes and improves in the long run, you build up from that mid single digits something above that number and potentially high single digits again.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "My second question is with the purchase of the Beijing manufacturing that you announced this morning. A couple of the medical technology companies have already hit upon the opportunities in China. Could you extrapolate what you see opportunistically there?", "David Dvorak", "This is one of the important markets, clearly, going forward. It's a market that as expected, if its round number is $1 billion today that within the next three years, it's going to be $2 billion in size. There's a significant Hip and Knee business already developed there, and we have a significant Hip and Knee business in the context of that market already. So this acquisition, when and if consummated, would add to our product offering. It would add to our local research and development capabilities as well as manufacturing and greatly broaden our distribution channel. So we have specific plans, I will tell you, for each of the important emerging markets globally. We think it's going to be an area that will drive future growth, and so this is just a step in executing a rather comprehensive plan to make sure that we're in leadership positions in the key markets that are going to drive a lot of growth in the future.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "I wonder if I could ask a little bit on the decision to expand the Durom liability reserve. A couple of questions first. But I guess in the first quarter, there was about $9 million of expenses close to the P&L. It fell outside of the parameters of that reserve. Was there any similar expenses close to the P&L this quarter?", "James Crines", "There were not, Raj. So with this provision, we've done a couple of things. We've expanded the definition of what we were calling certain claims to include all revisions worldwide related to surgeries that predated the suspension in 2008. So we broadened the definition of certain claims, and that therefore, picks up what was otherwise running through SG&A expenses on a quarterly basis.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "So we shouldn't expect to see more of those claims hit your P&L then?", "James Crines", "None of those claims as they relate to revisions for surgeries that occur prior to the suspension. But we'll still run through SG&A expenses as any revisions associated with surgeries post the suspension and after the product was re-launched into the market. But I would tell you, as you well know that, that market has shrunk and for us, sales of the Durom product are very modest relative to our total Hip business.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "I think you also implied that perhaps the revision rate was higher than maybe you initially thought. Is that true? Did I interpret that correctly?", "James Crines", "So that certainly one of the things that's leading to us having to increase the provision. Now we started out in the beginning with a very limited data set. These estimates are based on claims at the time that they were made, on claims that have been received at that particular point in time up to that point in time. So we obviously have, at this point, a much richer sort of data set. We're looking at two years worth of claims that have been made, and that gives us a lot of confidence that at this point, we feel we have an estimate that will cover, as I said, all revisions that predate the suspension.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Just one additional one on -- you're one of the many companies that have now mentioned these patient-specific knee guides as potential growth driver going forward. Have you quantified what percentage of Knees you're currently seeing using guides right now, and where you think that's going to go over time? How big of an opportunity you really think this is?", "David Dvorak", "It's a relatively low penetration rate within the industry at this point in time. But I think that it's the beginning of a broader trend. I think that the technologies will advance. I think that these technologies will merge into other areas that have been worked on in the past and including navigation broadly. So I think that in the intermediate and longer term, the penetration rates could get quite high. But it's really a first-generation offering within the industry that we're talking about now with these custom cut guides or pin guides.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "So is it well less than 5% then at this point?", "David Dvorak", "For us, clearly.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein.", "Derrick Sung - Bernstein Research", "So in the U.S., especially in the knee markets but also in the hip markets, it looks like the broader markets clearly slowed around you. But you've kind of maintained constant growth rate on a sequential basis. What I'm wondering here is, did you also see a slowdown in your procedures? And are you basically making up in this quarter that difference with mix, perhaps, that the other companies aren't seeing? Or did you see your procedures steady and perhaps your mix steady, which would then suggest that moving forward, you would then see greater opportunity to drive mix in the upcoming quarters?", "James Crines", "Derrick, this is Jim. We did see what I would describe as a modest step-down on procedure growth on the Knee side. And when you look at our recon results in the aggregate, we certainly did see and experience an improvement in our results on the Hip side and some of that is mix-related as we launched the new Continuum Cup System.", "Derrick Sung - Bernstein Research", "So on the Knee side then, what drove the mix then? It looks like your Knee growth still -- it stayed relatively steady.", "James Crines", "It would be the same new products that have driven some mix benefit within that Knee franchise over the past several quarters. So Trabecular Metal tibial trays, Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene liners, Prolong liners for the Knee system, those are just a couple of the products that continue to drive some positive mix benefit for us in Knees.", "Derrick Sung - Bernstein Research", "Going back to the China market, can you give some specifics on how big the market as a whole for Hips and Knees right now is in China, and kind of what kind of growth rates you've been seeing historically and you expect to see moving forward?", "James Crines", "Sure. As David indicated, we would define as the musculoskeletal market in China right now sort of we see it around $1 billion. About a third of that is Hips and Knees. And there's a fairly sizable Trauma market in China, actually larger than the Hip and Knee market right now. And then Spine would principally make up the balance to that $1 billion. That's a market that, as David said, we think will more than double in size over the next three years. So you're looking at very significant growth rates. And this is a market were the government has committed to invest somewhere in the order of $125 billion in providing better access to care, and that better access to care will drive, we think, more significant growth in elective hip and knee procedures.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Leerink Swann.", "Richard Newitter", "This is Rich in for Rick. I just wanted to maybe just follow up on that question on China. Did you guys say if the deal close or when it's expected to close? And also, when can we start to expect some sort of meaningful revenue contribution and increased share of that $1 billion market?", "David Dvorak", "We expect the deal, first of all, to close either the fourth quarter this year or the earlier part of next year. And obviously, this is part of a broader strategy on our part. So in the go-forward periods, we would expect to enjoy a significant portion of that growth within the large market. We think that the deal really accelerate some of the things that we'd like to do within that market. But again, we have a great group in China presently with a significant market position in both Knees and Hips, and we're growing that business currently at very attractive rates. So this is just an accelerator for us that's consistent with part of our broader strategy within that marketplace.", "Richard Newitter", "And then maybe just switching gears for a sec to Spine. It looks like the growth deceleration or the year-over-year growth rates, the deceleration is stabilized. And I was just wondering, are we kind of at the turning point here? And what sales or marketing or new products in that horizon? What initiatives get that growth rate going again?", "David Dvorak", "We have, I think, done a good job of extending the product portfolio, particularly in the core fusion market. So that is going to help us stabilize the business, Rich, in the intermediate term within the United States market. o U.S., we have a really nice offering in the current bag because some of the non-fusion products are marketed presently there, and we're already seeing an uptick in growth in o U.S. So I think that as we get into the second half of this year, we're going to see relatively attractive growth rates coming from our Spine business outside the United States. And then by the time we exit this year, we would expect to see a more stabilized U.S. business, and then we'll continue through our internal development to fill in some of the existing product gaps. But I will tell you, they're far less profound than they were a couple of years ago prior to the Abbott Spine acquisition.", "Richard Newitter", "And then maybe just one last quick one on Hips. As you launch your new products, the Continuum and MMC, I know metal-on-metal is a capability that these products enable you to address. Just wondering, given what seems like accelerating push-back or drop-off on metal-on-metal use, does this in any way impact your projected sales from these products, the mixed opportunities? If you could just comment there.", "David Dvorak", "Sure, Rich. It doesn't at all. We have the industry-leading in growth technology with Trabecular Metal, and that's really the premise of the Continuum System. But there are integrated taper systems that are designed for the o U.S. markets that are part of this broader Acetabular launch. And the bearing surfaces that we have to offer are clinically proven, first rate, bearing surfaces both polyethylene and ceramic, ceramic o U.S. at this point in time. So we have a very low market share of the metal-on-metal offering. And yet these alternative bearing surfaces that are clinically proven, very well received in the marketplace, and these new Acetabular Cups will just allow us to leverage our polyethylene technology as well as our metal-on-metal technology, as well as the delta BIOLOX does on this thing [ph] on ceramic side. So anything that a surgeon or patient could be looking for, we believe we can offer with these integrated taper systems that are coming out right now in the form of Continuum and the others.", "Operator", "Our next question comes the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Let me just rattle through a few loose ends. So since you guys finished up your prepared remarks, I've already heard a few folks comment to me that your pricing commentary sounded a bit worse than last quarter. And I think this is because you guys basically said that Knee pricing and Hip pricing was down about 30 or 40 basis points relative to what you said last quarter. But I think this is probably largely attributable to the price cuts that occurred in Asia, I guess, really in Japan. Is that the right way to think about that, that basically pricing is essentially stable in Hips and Knees with the exception of the biannual price cuts?", "James Crines", "That is exactly the right way to think about it, and that is precisely the reason for the slight sort of negative increase in Hip and Knee pricing between the second and first quarter.", "David Dvorak", "The price performance within the Americas division is dead on in the second quarter where it was in the first quarter. And so the incremental two-point decline in price within Asia-Pacific is driven by the cost that you just articulated, Doug.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "And going back to an earlier question from, I think it was from Mike, about you guys not narrowing the EPS range. We heard your explanation. But I'm just curious whether you would be willing to share exactly what scenario at this point you have modeled out that would lead you to get into the low end of the EPS range and maybe how likely that is given the strength that you've demonstrated over the first half of the year?", "David Dvorak", "We don't think that it's likely to end up at the lowest end of the range or below that level of the range. If there was a double dip in the economic recession and we found no traction for the new product launches and whatever else you want to put on that list, I suppose that could drive that type of performance. But that's not what any of us is believing will occur and certainly not what we're striving to do in the way of our business performance at this point in time. I think that the premise to that decision really is the one that Jim articulated earlier, and that is we're at the point in time where we're ramping up these new product launches. That traction cannot be predicted with absolute certainty down to the week or even the month. As to when you're going to start seeing progress, we have absolute confidence that we're going to see progress because of the clinical feedback that we're getting on these new product launches. So depending upon the pace of that ramp-up, you're going to end up somewhere within that top line guidance range for the year. And I think that's one of the most significant drivers, obviously, in addition to what happens externally with respect to the broader market.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "And then maybe building off of that last point, when we aggregate what we've heard from you and others who've reported already, it actually looks like you guys may be doing a little bit better in Hip, a little Hips a little bit earlier than at least I had expected. I know it may be premature to reach any conclusions based on just one quarter. But are there any signs that you are actually gaining traction here a little bit ahead of plan given you are in the very early stages of the new product rollouts?", "David Dvorak", "I think it's consistent with what we expected to have occurred. We did make some progress, and it's a fairly long time in the coming from our perspective. We're working hard. We think that we have a great portfolio at this point in time. We said all along that as we got these new Acetabular Cups out, coupled with our already very strong portfolio of stems,, we should be able to make good progress within the marketplace. I think we're just beginning to see that at this point in time. So it's relatively consistent with what we anticipated coming into the year, Doug.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Your gross margin guidance implies that in the second half, you're going to see I think about 100, 150 basis point improvement relative to that. I think it's 75.6% you did in the first half. This is clearly better than Street models and clearly better than what you guided us to earlier. How much of this is FX? And separate from FX, where are you tracking ahead of plan?", "James Crines", "Sure. So as I indicated for the second quarter, FX ended about 70 basis points. I would tell you, as we look at the back half of the year, the FX contribution is positive, but it's much more modest than that. So the real driver is the improvements in operating efficiency, and the fact that we're at or above our planned capacity utilization in the first half of the year. So as I said, we've been able to put lower costs inventory to the shelf over the first half of the year. So we have very good visibility to what this is going to look like in the second half of the year. And the other thing, as I also indicated is, that the better job that our operations people are doing, working together with our people on the field on managing inventory. So we've been able to bring inventory days down and bring them down even more profoundly than is reflected in our numbers because as we bring down the core inventory sets in the field, that's being offset by the investments we're making in the pipeline. We're seeing much lower excess in obsolescence charges run through cost of goods. So another thing that we have, I think good visibility too, and that's really what's leading to the improvement.", "Operator", "Our next question comes the line of Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.", "Matthew Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Jim, just to understand the comments you made on gross margin, I guess, heading into the back half of the year, I think I understood half the improvement in Q2 sequentially was -- it sounds like roughly was driven by FX. In the back half of the year, is that a contributor to your sort of stepping up your view on gross margins for the full year? Or how would you split out, I guess, operational versus FX in terms of that step-up in your outlook?", "James Crines", "Sure, Matt. And I just went through this with Doug and you may have dropped off there for a minute and missed it, but I'll just go quickly. The currency, while it's positive in the back half of the year, is much more modest than that 70 basis points that we picked up in the second quarter. So what's really driving the improvement is the improved utilization across our manufacturing network in the first half of the year. So we've been putting lower cost inventory to the shelf over the first half of the year. We have good visibility as to what that looks like and what impact that's going to have on margin in the second half. And the other thing is lower excess and obsolescence charges running through cost of goods as we do a better job of managing our field-based inventory deployment.", "Matthew Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies", "A couple of quick ones on smaller businesses. Dental and Spine, you showed a nice step-up in Dental sequentially. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about what you think the market is growing there at the moment, and what you've been doing there that's been improving your business? And then on Spine, sort of the other side of that, I guess, still challenged. Is it new product flow? Is it the distributor network or the way it's structured with your ortho distributors? Maybe talk about what you need to do on that side of your business.", "David Dvorak", "Sure. I'll take those questions, Matt. I think on the Dental side, it's just fundamentals coming together. With respect to the performance, we've got a nice cadence, a new product flow. We have a really good leadership team in place that understands that business and is making great progress and strengthening the depth of knowledge throughout all levels within that division. They're very focused on growing their business. They see a great opportunity in that market as we do, notwithstanding what's transpired over the last couple of years. And so it's a stabilizing market at this point in time. I wouldn't describe our performance as probably being market-level performance. I would suspect that our growth rate is above market growth rate. I would suspect that, that market growth rate is probably flat to slightly positive, a couple three points of growth that we'll see as the much larger players report out what their results look like and gain greater visibility to that. And again, the fundamentals, we've got a good leadership team, a good product cadence, a focused sales force and they're executing quite well coming out of a difficult time period. So we're really optimistic about what we're going to be able to do with that business going forward. Spine, we're a click or two behind in those categories. But working in the right direction to be able to talk to you about our Spine performance in the same way that we sit here and talk here about the Dental performance in due time, making good progress on ramping up sales. o U.S., we think that we're sorting out the right priorities for our internal development product pipeline, and we've got a lot of good talent in the distribution network. It is not kind of largely integrated in any significant way, Matt, with our Reconstructive distribution channel. So it's quite dependent of that focus on Spine. And I think we have some good people there, and we need to get them a good opportunity with a full product bag to go out and compete. And so that's what we're working on, and I would expect to see our performance o U.S. improve within that Spine market in the second half of the year and then begin to stabilize at the end of the year within the United States market, and head into 2011 with good prospects to see some growth come out of the Spine division.", "Operator", "Our final question will come from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.", "Steve Beuchaw - Wachovia", "It's Steve Beuchaw in for David. One quick one on inventory. We were a little bit surprised by the level this quarter. Can you comment on the underlying drivers between the balance of input costs, market dynamics and then maybe your expectations for the balance of the year?", "James Crines", "Sure. First of all, as we indicated or I indicated in my prepared remarks, Steve, inventory days on hand, which is how we measure sort of inventories, and we calculate that using a quarterly cost of goods so that it's somewhat sensitive to quarter-to-quarter changes in cost of goods. It came in 57 days below where we were in the second quarter of last year. At $886 million, the total investment in inventory dollars is down $10 million from the first quarter of this year, and that's in spite of significant pipeline build-out for the new product launches. So I would tell you that if anything, we're kind of ahead of where we would have expected to be at this point the year in terms of making progress on better managing our field inventory deployments. And it's one of the things, as I indicated, that's contributing to our stronger outlook for gross margin in the back half of the year. I would tell you, as far as the balance of the year, we typically see an increase in inventory days in the third quarter because of the slowdown in procedure volumes. And as we continue to build inventory through the summer months in advance of what ends up being a busier surgery schedule, busier schedule for surgeries in the fourth quarter, we would expect to see a bit of an increase on days on-hand in the third quarter and then have it come back down in the fourth quarter.", "Steve Beuchaw - Wachovia", "And then a question on the move into China. Clearly, a significant and fast growing market. But I wonder if you could comment on the balance of factors that drive the appeal of moving into the market between the top line, sizing growth opportunity and the opportunity to leverage a low-cost manufacturing out of that market? Could you give us your thoughts there in how you balance the two?", "David Dvorak", "This step that we announced today is really driven towards better positioning us to compete effectively in that market. Again, we picked up some great capabilities on the product development side, a broader distributor channel, a broader portfolio of products that are designed for that specific market at this point in time. And that's really the principal driver for that transaction. A collateral benefit to be sure will be enhancing our capabilities on the manufacturing side within that jurisdiction, and that is one that I would think of as more an intermediate or longer-term objective and strategic rationale for the deal. So the principal driver is to position us to compete effectively within China itself.", "Thank you all again for joining us this morning and for your continued interest in Zimmer. We look forward to speaking to you on our third quarter conference call at 8 a.m. on October 28, 2010. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to you, Regina.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call.

I am Paul Blair, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zimmer. I would like to welcome you to the Zimmer Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today to host this call are David Dvorak, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Crines, Executive Vice President, Finance, and Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning we will review our performance for the third quarter, provide you with an update on certain key matters, present an update on our outlook for 2010 and conclude our discussion with a question-and-answer session. We understand that this is a very busy reporting day, and we'll do our best to keep today's call close to an hour in length. Therefore, we ask that participants pose one question with one follow-up to allow as many callers as possible the opportunity to take part in today's call.", "Before we get started, I would like to point out that this presentation contains forward-looking statements within the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the orthopedics industry, management's beliefs and assumptions made by management.

We're glad you could join us for today's call. This morning, I'll review our third quarter 2010 results and provide some commentary on general market conditions. Jim will then discuss additional financial details.", "We delivered solid earnings and cash flow performance in the third quarter, notwithstanding challenging global economic conditions that negatively impacted procedure rates. Our performance reflects a focus on disciplined spending in executing our strategic plan. A core element of this plan involves a new product introductions across our businesses. These introductions will position us for an improved performance in the fourth quarter and accelerate growth beyond 2010 as the economy strengthens.", "Net sales for the quarter were $965 million, a decrease of 0.5% on a constant-currency basis, and our earnings per share were $0.96 on an adjusted basis, an increase of 9.1% over the prior year period. For the quarter, our Americas and Europe, Middle East and Africa segments experienced constant currency sales declines of 0.4% and 3.8%, respectively, while the Asia Pacific region grew 4.2% constant currency.", "Knee sales for the quarter decreased year-over-year 2.7% constant currency, reflecting negative volume and mix of 0.4% and negative price of 2.3%. Important advances for Zimmer Knees included a broader rollout of our Patient Specific Instruments and a limited rollout of our posterior referencing instruments.", "Moving into the fourth quarter and to a greater extent throughout 2011, we expect to see accelerating growth with these knee instruments being deployed broadly. A number of additional MRI centers have been certified to process our Patient Specific Instruments, and we have had continued commercial success based on the unique and differentiating features and benefits of our system.", "Meanwhile, early clinical feedback on our posterior referencing instruments have been very positive. Recent National Joint Replacement Registry data continues to demonstrate outstanding long-term clinical success of our NexGen and Natural-Knee product families, and we're confident that our enhanced instrumentation options will drive increased adoption globally.", "Our Hip business performed above market in the Americas in the quarter with sales improving year-over-year, 2.7% on a constant-currency basis. Overall, our Hip sales increased 0.5% constant currency, reflecting positive volume and mix of 2.7% and negative price of 2.2%.", "We're encouraged that is volume and mix growth relative to market is verification of increasing momentum we're experiencing in the commercialization of our new Hip products. In particular, the Continuum Acetabular Cup System provide surgeons with the flexibility to select from alternative bearing surfaces to meet the diverse and unique needs of their total hip replacement patients.", "The Continuum System has provided an important expansion to our hip portfolio. As we've described before, momentum from a new product introduction generally builds over the course of one or more operating periods as the implement instruments and related training are deployed. We're on track with our expectations for the stage rollout of the Continuum System.", "The performance of our Hip business in the quarter was also supported by continued strong sales of Revision Hip products, a category in which Zimmer has achieved overall leading market share. We also saw growth in sales of our stem products, including the M/L Taper with connective technology, which offers a modular adjustable neck system that enables surgeons to personalize fit interoperatively for each patient.", "Extremities products posted sales growth of 3.6% constant currency for the quarter, which compares to a high 20.5% growth rate from the third quarter of last year. These results were again supported by sales of our Shoulder products, featuring Trabecular Metal Technology, including the TM Reverse Shoulder and TM Glenoid.", "Continuing its solid performance for the year in a market heavily impacted by general economic conditions, Zimmer Dental sales increased 4.9% constant currency for the quarter. Our Dental business is generating broad-based sales momentum across implants, restorative components and regenerative products.", "Trauma sales in the quarter were up over the prior year period by 0.5% constant currency. We recently announced the 1,000th U.S. implantation of our Cephalomedullary Nail, a key component of the Zimmer Natural Nail System. Continued success in the commercialization of this new product bodes well for the rest of the Zimmer Natural Nail System, which features a wide range of lengths and diameters and in innovative anatomical design. We also announced the first implantation of the NCB Periprosthetic Plating system, a first of its kind solution for addressing complex femoral fractures that can occur around the knee or hip implant.", "While Zimmer Spine reported an overall sales decrease of 7.4% constant currency in the quarter, European Spine sales experienced strong growth of 21.1% constant currency. In our Spine business, we continue to drive operational changes and pursuing aggressive new product development pipeline.", "In the third quarter, Zimmer Surgical, formerly known as Orthopaedic Surgical Products, experienced a solid 8.2% constant currency growth. We continue to see strong sales of our wound debridement devices and bone cement products.", "I'll now touch briefly on some operational developments and other topics. Operationally, we improved our sequential gross margin and cash flow to support corporate investments, including a new product development initiatives designed to accelerate our growth. While we increased spending on product development, our margins remain strong, with operating margins improving 160 basis points in the third quarter compared to the prior year. Cash flow remains at a high level, a point on which Jim will provide more detail.", "Consolidated pricing for the quarter was consistent with our expectations, decreasing slightly from the second quarter. Consolidated average selling prices in the third quarter were down 1.4% compared to the prior year period. We experienced negative pricing of 1.6% in the Americas, flat pricing in our Europe, Middle East and Africa region and negative pricing in the Asia Pacific region of 2.9%. We continue to anticipate consolidated price erosion of between 1% and 2% for the year.", "In the third quarter, the market experienced a slowdown in procedure volumes due to global economic conditions, unemployment and other factors. High unemployment has resulted in expiring health insurance and COBRA subsidies in the U.S., as well as a decline in enrollment in private health plans.  Demographic analysis suggests that these trends has had a particularly notable impact on the non-Medicare potential patient base for joint replacement procedures, those between 45 and 65 years of age.", "The balance of the slowdown in the U.S. is attributed to seasonality effects, which include a combination of slower surgery schedules and patients delaying care until high deductibles are met. Similarly, austerity measures are contributing to the overall slowed procedure volumes in Europe.", "Now long-term indicators still point towards sustained growth, and we continue to believe that the knee and hip market should grow in the mid-single digits. That outlook is based on anticipated growth in developed markets with aging populations, as well as higher penetration rates in emerging markets in which increasing numbers of patients are gaining access to healthcare.", "Even with the economic pressures that we've seen over the last 18 to 24 months, healthcare providers and third-party payers recognize that these replacement procedures are cost effective. They take costs out of the system as opposed to continuing to manage the chronic conditions to which patients would otherwise be exposed. We remain committed to executing our strategic plan with the focus on disciplined financial performance.", "Jim will now provide further details on the quarter and on our updated sales and earnings guidance. Jim?", "James Crines", "Thanks, David. I will review our third quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our 2010 guidance. As David mentioned, our total revenues for the quarter were $965 million, a 0.5% constant currency decline compared to the third quarter of last year.", "Net currency impact for the quarter was slightly negative, decreasing revenues by an additional 0.5% or $5.2 million.", "The unfavorable currency impact from our euro-denominated sales in the quarter was partially offset by a favorable currency impact from our Japanese yen and Australian dollar denominated revenues. Our adjusted gross profit margin was 77.3% for the quarter. The margin ratio is up 260 basis points compared to third quarter of 2009, an increase of 100 basis points compared with the second quarter 2010.", "Improved management of our global inventories has resulted in lower excess in obsolescence expense compared with the third quarter of prior year. Additionally, prior year results reflect certain charges for scrap, idle plant and cleanup activities following the 2009 fire in our Warsaw manufacturing plant.", "Lastly, the improvement in gross margin also reflects the manufacturing network operating at higher levels of efficiency in 2010 compared with prior year. As outlined in the second quarter call, we expect our gross margin ratio to be between 76% and 76.5% for the full year, assuming that foreign currency exchange rates remain near recent levels. This includes a lower gross margin ratio in the fourth quarter due to less favorable hedge results.", "R&D expense as a percentage of sales was at 6%, and at $57.6 million for the quarter is 10% higher on a total dollar basis when compared to the prior year. This increase is in line with our strategy to focus more investment into new product development activities and clinical programs.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses were $412 million in the third quarter, and at 42.7% of sales or 40 basis points above prior year. SG&A spending for the third quarter of 2010 in absolute dollar terms is slightly below the third quarter of the prior year.", "Acquisition, integration, realignment and other amounted to $5 million in the quarter. These expenses include integration costs from our pending acquisition of Beijing Montagne, a onetime cost stemming from distributor acquisitions in our Europe, Middle East and Africa segment, realignment of our global IT infrastructure and other of the prior period acquisitions.", "Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased to $277 million. At 28.7%, our adjusted operating profit sales ratio is 160 basis points higher than the prior year third quarter due to improvements in gross margins that are partially offset by increased research and development expense.", "Net interest expense for the quarter amounted to $14.2 million compared to $4.2 million in the prior quarter. Similar to the last two quarters, the change is primarily due to the $1 billion senior unsecured notes offering we completed in November of 2009.", "Adjusted net earnings were $192 million for the third quarter, an increase of 2.2% compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9.1% to $0.96 on a 199.7 million average outstanding diluted shares. These adjusted earnings per share includes above approximately $0.05 of share-based compensation. At $0.96, reported diluted earnings per share, which include the items reflected in acquisition, integration, realignment and other, increased to 37% over the prior year third quarter reported EPS of $0.70.", "Our adjusted effective tax rate for quarter was 26.7%. We anticipate that 2010 full year tax rate will be approximately 27%. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.2 million shares at a total purchase price of $225.6 million. As of September 30, 2010, approximately $1.3 billion remained authorized under our $1.5 billion repurchase program, which expires at the end of 2013. The company had approximately 197 million shares of common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2010, down from 204 million as of December 31, 2009.", "We continually review the best utilization of the cash that we generate. Our intentions with regard to use of free cash flow remain the same as we have indicated for some time. Our first priority is external development, when and it's the right opportunity to rise. There are technology products or business that strategically align with our focus on musculoskeletal health. We balance this priority with maintaining strong liquidity and continue to believe that share repurchases are an efficient and effective way to return excess free cash flow to our shareholders.", "Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $320 million, down 9% from $352 million in the third quarter of 2009. Net inventories were $923 million at the end of the third quarter, $44 million less than third quarter prior year. Adjusted inventory days on hand finished the quarter at 380 days, an increase of 27 days compared with the third quarter of 2009. This increase in days on hand is largely driven by the sensitivity of the calculation in year-over-year improvements and cost of goods sold. Our adjusted trade accounts receivable days sales outstanding finished the quarter at 67 days, an increase of four days over the third quarter of 2009.", "Net receivables increased $14 million or 2% over prior year. Depreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter amounted to $84 million. Free cash flow in the third quarter was $256 million,  $47 million lower than the third quarter of 2009. We define free cash flow as operating cash flow less cash outflows for instruments and property, plant and equipment.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $64 million, including $50 million for instruments and $14 million for property, plant and equipment. Cash outlays associated with investing activities during the quarter include $2.5 million for certain international distributor acquisitions.", "I'd like to turn now to our guidance for 2010. In our earnings release this morning, we provided  fourth quarter revenue and adjusted EPS guidance and updated our full year guidance. Fourth quarter revenues are expected to increase between zero and 2% on a constant-currency basis as we continue to gain momentum with new products and instruments.", "As a result, the company now expects 2010 full year revenues to increase approximately 2% on a constant-currency basis, which compares with prior guidance of between 3% and 5%.", "Assuming foreign currency exchange rates remain near recent levels, the company estimates that foreign currency translation will decrease revenues by approximately 1% in the fourth quarter and increase revenues by 0.5% for the full year 2010. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be in the range of $1.17 to $1.22. As a result, adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be in the range of $4.24 to $4.29 for the full year 2010.", "David, I'll turn the call back over to you.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you Jim. In summary, our third quarter performance reflected solid bottom line performance in a climate of macroeconomic pressures. The outlook for the remainder of the year anticipates continued progress with recent product and instrumentation launches, supported by a full offering of medical education and training programs.", "Our organization retains a broad sense of optimism about the potential for our industry. The long-term positive indicators for our sector are compelling. In the face of heightened scrutiny about healthcare costs, our increasingly diversified portfolio of early and late-stage intervention musculoskeletal products provide cost-effective solutions for the patients and global healthcare systems we serve.", "And now I'd like to ask Celeste to begin the Q&A portion of our call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein.", "Derrick Sung - Bernstein Research", "I wanted to start by asking you a little bit about the European dynamic in hips and knees. So it looks like Europe perhaps took another step down maybe in the market as a whole, certainly for your sales this quarter after seeing a couple of quarters of somewhat weak but stable growth. Two questions related to that. Was there anything that changed over this past quarter to result in that? And then secondly, as you think about the budgets getting reset for 2011 and the austerity measures being put in place, what it in your mind is the risk of kind of another step down in procedure volumes or another step down in sort of healthcare spending pressure that would pressure procedure volumes coming from new budgets being put in place in 2011?", "David Dvorak", "Derrick, we did see a slower market with respect to procedures in Europe. For us, the pricing environment didn't change much from the second quarter to the third quarter. So I think that some of the austerity measures in the macroeconomic conditions created environment where the was a more profound element of seasonality to the business. It's always a slow market in the third quarter within Europe due to the holiday schedules, but it was exacerbated by the economic conditions. I would tell you, with respect to looking forward in that market, I think that one of the limitations as to how aggressive people can push in managing these procedure rates down is a political one. At some point, the known success of these procedures among the patient base and the recognition by the payors with these national healthcare systems is that it's not a cost effective move to differ these procedures in any extended form. And frankly, it becomes politically untenable at some point. And I think that you have to that bear in mind as you look forward and anticipate what those markets would look like in the future. Now the majority of our business is in the five or six most developed markets, and those slowdowns that we saw were more profound market-wise, it seems, in hips than in knees and we obviously have a significant market share in those European markets. And so that impacted the quarter to an extent. And then finally, if you're looking at our performance within Europe sequentially, you'll note that we picked up a billing day in Q2 and lost a billing day in Q3. And so that explains a bit of the sequential performance difference from Q2 to Q3 for us.", "Derrick Sung - Bernstein Research", "And then just a follow up on pricing. So it looks like pricing in hips and knees decelerated further from I believe you said it was last quarter kind of in the 1.5% to 1.6% range, specifically to hips and knees, to kind of 2.2% to down 2.3% range this quarter. It sounds like most of that came from the U.S., if you're saying that Europe pricing held pretty steady. Can you provide further color on that and kind of where you see that pricing trajectory going?", "David Dvorak", "Yes, that pricing performance is consistent with what we expected to see coming into the year. We anticipated the 1% to 2% element of price erosion in our business, and that's exactly what we're seeing. It is true that the price erosion in the U.S. for the third quarter was a bit more significant than in the second quarter. But it's also the case with Japan because that price decline hasn't anniversaried out yet big impacted our overall step down from 0.9% to 1.4% for the quarter. And I don't think that the dynamics, Derrick, have changed much in the U.S. Those discussions are similar to what's taken place in the past quarters, and I think you could anticipate that they're going to continue to be similar with respect to pricing discussions going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.", "Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I wanted to touch on a couple of areas. And David, I appreciate, it's very hard to try and make sense of the market off of one difficult quarter for the company. But you expressed your confidence in what you think is a sustainable mid-single digit growth market for hips and knees. And I just wanted to maybe just get your view that within that, how do you view pricing mix play in component? In order to do a mid-single revenue growth, what you think about the growth would need to be?", "David Dvorak", "Again, we still think that there's an opportunity with respect to mix. And Mike, that's just going to be dependent upon where we are within each product category on new product rollouts. If you've anniversaried out of that mix benefit and you're not introducing something else within that category, you're probably going to see a bit of negative impact between price and mix at that particular point in time. On the other hand, if you're ratcheting up a launch and it's a significant launch that provides you with mixed opportunity, you could see some positive impact that's between price and mix at that point in time. So I think it's just going to be dependent upon where you are in the product rollout cycle. But if you have a healthy flow within this marketplace and you're addressing unmet clinical needs, I still do think that you can see either a wash in those categories or some modest positive impact as between price and mix going forward.", "Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "If we start to think about 2011, I noted in your comments earlier that price had gotten a little bit worst in the quarter. I think across the company you guys said it was down 1.7% this quarter. How should we be thinking about it for 2011?", "David Dvorak", "So we're not going to give 2011 guidance, but as far as the market goes, I think you have to look at price in a similar fashion to 2010 at this point in time. You're going to have a similar environment, I would believe in the United States. I think that Europe may get a little bit more aggressive. On the other hand, Asia Pacific, you're going to anniversary out after the first quarter of the Japan adjustments that took places, and those were significant for most of the competitors. And certainly, that's the case for us because of the size of that business relative to our overall Asia Pacific business.", "Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "So even with the kind of deterioration we saw from 2Q to 3Q in price in the Americas and it looks like a little bit in Europe, too, that you think that 2011 pricing looks similar to 2010?", "David Dvorak", "Yes. I mean, I think that coming into the year, we said minus 1% to 2% and that the rate where we're tracking were minus 1%. But that range I think is as good as one that I can give you at this particular point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with UBS.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS Investment Bank", "David, if you kind of look from January '09 through the first quarter of '10, the combined markets constant currency were probably a little less than 5%. And based on what we saw in the United States in '09, ASPs were probably in positive territory. So it's a four-point unit market or three-point unit market in the U.S. I don't know and I don't think anybody knows. And so going forward, we're modeling 4%. You say 5% from those. But just to your comment on hips and product mix, you guys have new products. And I think you said volume mix was 2.7%, but price was minus 2.2%. Is it just a safer assumption to assume net zero ASP going forward?", "David Dvorak", "Net zero ASP, so a wash between price and mix?", "Bruce Nudell - UBS Investment Bank", "Yes.", "David Dvorak", "Yes, I think that that's a reasonable assumption, but I think that you're going to have point in time where there's some headwind in that category, Bruce, and then some other opportunities to show some modest positives that's between those two.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS Investment Bank", "But I guess just at this instance in time, you do have new hips. And hips should be -- this would be one of those times, or is there something that makes that more complicated that meets the eye?", "David Dvorak", "No, you're right. And again, you have to factor in where you are in the launch of those products. So we're really just beginning to hit the traction point. There's a lot of emphasis on the U.S. market, and so you saw some improvement in our performance relative to the market within the U.S. On the hip side, the penetration is continuing. Within that particular market right now, you have to remember that there's a bit of headwind on the Metal-on-Metal mix. And that's an element of that continuum set. But for that headwind, we'd be seeing a lot more mix benefit coming from Continuum. But that's the reality of the market of that we're launching the product into.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS Investment Bank", "And then just strategically, let's say it could be anywhere from a 4% to 5% kind of steady-state market, but there is probably a risk of deflationary pressures worsening on the net of pricing mix. What sort of things could Zimmer do strategically to kind of diversify a way from this sector, where you've got reasonable but not great volumes and some potential increase in deflationary pressure?", "David Dvorak", "Well, I mean, take market share in the core businesses first and foremost. But when you look at our existing portfolio as it sits today, Bruce, there are big opportunities for us in those smaller product categories. So spine, dental trauma, surgical products we have less than 10% market share. And in instances, less than 5% market share in each of those categories. And what we're experiencing there, oftentimes because of that market position, you don't have as much price pressure as you do in an instance where you have 30% or 40% market share and have had that market share historically. So we're this business and investing in these global businesses in a manner where we expect to outpace market growth, take market share and those are going to be big opportunities for us. Furthermore, the continuum of care that we've been talking both earlier interventions and late interventions put us in a position to move upstream, and the treatment of these patients intervene with biological solutions. So hyaluronic acid is an interesting one for us. We have a great set of relationships that we could to push that kind of a product to our existing distribution channels, and there are a lot of opportunities for us to broaden the business and expand our growth rates in those categories as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes up from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Robert Hopkins", "So back just on the pricing front again and the sequential downtick in hips and knees, that's not all Japan sequentially I would assume. Specific as it relates to hips and knees, is that correct? It's more than just the sequential downtick in Japan.", "David Dvorak", "That's correct. I mean, if you're talking about the step down from the second quarter to the third quarter, that would principally be the Americas.", "Robert Hopkins", "And so any further color on that dynamic away from what you've said already?", "James Crines", "I think, Bob, when you look at what's happening with procedure volumes, our sense is that the slowdown is really happening on the private pay side. So perhaps at a hospital level, the hospitals are looking at somewhat unfavorable trend in payor mix. And we know for a fact that if you go back to 2008, 2009, Medicare enrollment was already increasing at a faster rate than enrollment in private health plans. So that's some of what has created this pressure. And I think it's fair to say that pressure has intensified somewhat. But again, we continue to manage through that pressure and believe average selling prices across our franchises globally, as David said, will be down in a range that we guided to at the beginning of the year of 1% to 2%.", "Robert Hopkins", "And then the one follow-up I have is on the knee franchise, you've guys have talked about Europe and the issues there. But in the U.S., it looks like on that knee franchise, you saw a deceleration. I was wondering, do you think you're losing share in knees, you're losing some surgeons? Or just talk about the knee dynamic in the United States in Q3 versus what you saw in the first half of the year.", "David Dvorak", "Yes, we think that we need to improve our execution front to be sure, Bob, because the performance that we saw come out of our business for in the third quarter on the U.S. side wasn't at market growth rates. And so there's some loss of business there. I think that we have the right plans in place and we're executing those plans. And most importantly, those initiatives are around these instruments to augment our already existing excellent clinical performance with the NexGen and Natural Knee Systems. And so that's a big opportunity for us because those are instrument sets that are differentiated in the case of PSI, and accommodating in the case of PRI of surgical philosophies that many competitive surgeons come to the table with. So we have one of the best-performing knee systems and now a set of instruments that's going to accommodate that particular surgeon customer, and I think that it's going to be a great growth opportunity for us. But the third quarter marked the point where we introduced those PRI instruments only on a limited basis. And again, it takes some time for those sets to get deployed for surgeons to train, to trial and to work through the sales process. And we're optimistic that as these months progress, you're going to see an improved performance driven by a that initiative as well as others.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Feinstein with Barclays Capital.", "Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital", "I guess just a question about new products. Maybe you could just quantify how much of your revenues came from new products in the quarter and just trying to think about just opportunity there, and just trying to think about the outlook in terms of that being a catalyst for growth so we are in a slower market environment. I guess one could argue that new product launches are more important than ever. So just trying to understand what sort of impact that may have had in the quarter, and how you're thinking about that over the next 12 months.", "James Crines", "Sure. We've said historically that before we spend on R&D, we look to be in a range of 15% to 20% of revenue with new product revenues, and we define that as products that have been released in the last 36 months. I would tell you with respect to the Hip franchise, we're within that target range but outside of that range when you look at the Knee franchise. And as you think about what we have going on with Knees, with the launch of these new instruments, that's where we're seeing a competitive pressure on Knees. There are competitive systems out there with new, more modern instruments. Our response to that is both the new PSI instruments as well as the posterior referencing instruments. And as David indicated, we're still early into the launch for those instrument systems. The fact those instruments will not really necessarily have an impact on that metric, so until we launch new devices within the Knee franchise, we're not likely going to see much of an increase in new product revenue within the Knee franchise. What we're really looking for to drive performance there again is the launch of the new instrument systems.", "Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital", "I guess, as you guys just think about deploying your free cash flow and thinking about opportunities there and pretty conservative balance sheet, just any thoughts in terms of, I guess, the ability to take on additional leverage to buyback stock or do any acquisition opportunities? So I guess what are your most current thoughts there?", "David Dvorak", "Well, as I indicated in my prepared remarks", "[Audio Gap]", "free cash flow the way we have historically. That is the first priority we'd look for business opportunities that as I said, strategically align with our focus on musculoskeletal health. We'll otherwise continue to return excess cash to shareholders through the share repurchase program. As you know, we did issue $1 billion in long-term notes in 2009. So we have levered up to some degree, and that's helped us in some respect to be more aggressive in terms of returning cash to shareholders. As we indicated, we spent $225 million in the third quarter on share repurchases. And as we've said before, we're going to continue to target somewhere in the order returning a third to a half of our net income on an annual basis through that share repurchase program.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Jim, can you just talk a little bit about SG&A spending? I think on last quarter's conference call, you had guided us to a number somewhere in 43.5% of sales range. In David's openings remarks, you referenced tight cost containment measures. I assume some of that had to do with the revenue trends you saw throughout the quarter. Can you maybe just help us understand in the quarter how much of the SG&A relative to your guidance was natural leverage versus proactive measures that you took?", "James Crines", "Yes. So as you pointed out on our second quarter call, we indicated that SG&A was expected to be approximately 42% for the full year. At the time, we have projected approximately 43.5% for the third quarter. We clearly came in below that level. And since our third quarter SG&A expenses came in lower than we have projected and historical trends tell us that seasonality should have a favorable impact on ratio for the fourth quarter. We would now expect the full year SG&A ratio to be lower than our prior guidance of 42%. This is an area, David, that we continue to focus on. We've acknowledged that at 42%, our SG&A ratio is out of line with industry benchmarks. And I would tell as we develop our operating plans for 2011, that is something that we'll get a fair amount of attention. We have opportunity here we would acknowledge to drive more leverage through the P&L by taking that SG&A ratio down and bring it more in line with industry benchmarks.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And then on the gross margin this quarter that you called out the drivers of the year-over-year improvement, primarily being efficiencies to the plants and lower excess and obsolete inventory cost, did foreign currency gains contributed at all to the year-over-year improvement?", "James Crines", "They did, net hedge gains in the third quarter accounts for approximately 40 basis points of our gross margin. And I would tell you that assuming currency rates remain near-recent levels, the effect of hedge gains and losses on gross margin in the fourth quarter will be lower. So for the fourth quarter, we're projecting losses, for example, on the yen, Aussie dollar, Canadian dollar and British pound hedge contracts just given the way the dollar is traded against those currencies. And that will be partially offset by what we would predicted this time will be modest gains on euro hedge contract. So that does create a bit of a headwind going into the fourth quarter.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And then lastly for David. Obviously, you've been stepping up R&D on absolute dollars pretty consistently over the past two quarters. Maybe just help us understand where that incremental R&D spending is being focused. Is that on the core businesses, the Hip and Knee franchise? Or are dedicating an increasing percentage to those non-core businesses? And should we start to see the relative pace of new product introductions to be more significant in your peripheral businesses rather than Hips and Knees?", "David Dvorak", "Sure, it's broad-based across all the product categories. I think that if you look at a longer-term trend as to where we were, say, five years or so ago, David, it is broader-based. There's been greater emphasis in the global businesses than there was that five-year time period previous. And I think that you're going to start see some of the benefits of those investments in the coming quarters. Notably, we've emphasized a great deal of investment in the Trauma area and the Natural Nail line is rolling out now that we're seeing some good early clinical success with is an example of what we intent to do on those product categories. Again, those are markets that are very attractive markets. The skill sets that it takes to compete effectively in those markets are very transferable from the core recon business and in instances, the distribution channels overlapped as well. So we can create a lot of value with growth in those global businesses. And going back sometime, we started to enhance our investment to drive that opportunity.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "I just wanted to go back to the pricing commentary about kind of Europe. And I guess you're seeing obviously more pressure from the austerity measures from a procedure basis, and I'm just wondering do you expect that some of the tenders come up to see greater pressure on price and maybe some alleviation on some of the procedure side?", "David Dvorak", "That is potentially the case, Kristen. I think that some of that depends on the jurisdiction and the structure and how centralized the systems are versus the more regional systems. And so there are jurisdictions where their lever is more a procedure level, and others where their lever is more of a price level. So we have a pretty significant market share in most of those developed jurisdictions across Europe. And what we reported out as being essentially flat pricing in Europe is indicative of what we're seeing right now. But it could be the case that in some of those jurisdictions, price gets pushed a bit harder as they free up the procedure rates.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Are some of the tenders that you've gone through more recently suggesting that pricing could get worse going forward and...", "David Dvorak", "No, I wouldn't say that because I think that, that tender business always had that character to it. Those are typically not the highest margin opportunities but they're volume opportunities, and so they can make some economic sense on a couple on fronts. For one thing, if you're absorbing overhead, the marginal profit can still be unacceptable. On another front, it could be that you want to participate in those tenders because that's an emerging market that's going to continue to grow. And so getting in at this point in time is strategically consistent with your plans. So either way, those are elements of the business that we want to be very engaged in and have been historically.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "And then you said Americas pricing was down 1.6%.  What was it last quarter again, I'm sorry, in 2Q?", "James Crines", "It was 1.1% in the second quarter.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "And then just as we think about that dynamic, I mean, as I have always kind of looked at things, you guys have locked up contracts with GPO, it's usually for an extended period of time. So what really is explaining such a dramatic or what seem to be a dramatic downtick sequentially? Are hospitals kind of breaking old contracts? Are the net new contracts that you're signing just suggesting that price is materially down? Can you help us just kind of understand what it's just down significant degree on a sequential basis?", "David Dvorak", "Kristen, I would tell you that and we've pointed this out in prior calls that we no longer would rely on broadly speaking the contracts that are in place at a given point in time. We've seen a lot of churn over the past few years, and it continued to be the case that many of our individual hospital pricing agreements are often getting renegotiated somewhere in the middle of their term or certainly prior to the end of the term. And that continues to be the case.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "So I guess then, suffice it to say, certainly as this continues then pricing is likely to get worse based upon where we're heading certainly. And if the ability of hospitals to renegotiate the middle contracts would suggest that you guys have a less of a bargaining position? Is that fair to say?", "David Dvorak", "Well, I would say just what we said before, we continue to manage through the pressure. It's been around for some time. And I think our contract management people working together with our independent distributors in the U.S. Our sales management teams outside the U.S. have done a pretty effective job of managing pressures. So that we are able to provide the kind of guidance that we provided coming into the year. And we're seeing results that are right in line with where we told people they would be for the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Can you give us an update on the sales force at this stage in terms of turnover, and also in terms of sentiments given that the market is going through this transition?", "David Dvorak", "Yes, I would say that the sales force continues to be very engaged. I don't think that there's been turnover that's been out of line with any historic averages, Joanne, either.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "And then there was a new product, which you launched in the last 12 to 18 months in the Hip Continuum and the MMC. Could you please give us an update on how those products are tracking?", "David Dvorak", "Sure. And some of new product launches are what's driving that continued engagement within the sales force, obviously. On the Hip side, as you mentioned, the Continuum system as well as the MMC system were launches that were initiated the very end of last year. And so those launches are under way. We're starting to see the productivity of those launches, particularly on the Continuum side. I will tell you that the MMC Cup is a less significant launch in light of what's happened in that Metal-on-Metal category. I think that there's going to continue to be a market out there for the Metal-on-Metal, but it's going to be less significant. And that was not a segment that we were heavily penetrated in prior to the market turning the way that it has. So we didn't have much business in that category, and I think that those that had a lot of business in that category are seeing the mix of that business turn probably likely more towards polyethylene solutions at this point in time. But the Continuum system is a very encouraging launch for us. You can see what it's allowed us to do and even at downmarket over the course of a slow summer within the U.S. business and step up to above market growth rates. So continue to be very encouraged, and I think that there is more runway out in front of us on that launch", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Leerink Swann.", "Frederick Wise - Leerink Swann LLC", "Back on the procedure volumes side. Several companies this quarter have already given some sense that the third quarter seasonally weak of course, but the second half of the quarter was better than first, or they saw some signs of rebound in September and into October. Can you give us any color about the directionality? Or do you just feel like things are sort of dead flat in a broad sense? Or are we trending a little better? Any perspective will be welcome.", "David Dvorak", "Sure. They've been obviously a lot of questions to try to break these quarters apart. And we've anticipating the current quarter and obviously, that's a place that we can't go just as others went. I'm not familiar with people coming back and providing color along the lines of what you are articulated. But I'm sure that you have heard something from people, Rick, that give you a basis for making that statement. In our case, I would tell you that, that procedural slow down was relatively consistent through the summer months. So I can't really look at the performance on a procedural basis and disaggregate the quarter in a way that can offer you any better understanding. I think that what you see in our results was pretty consistent through the entire third quarter.", "Frederick Wise - Leerink Swann LLC", "And to be fair, just for you information, it was a bunch of smaller companies and some non-ortho companies just for your perspective. But just as a follow-up question. Maybe some updated portfolio strategy thoughts, and specifically as it relates to Spine and maybe more broadly. On the Spine side, continued weak. from here, and again any updated thoughts can you do it internally or are you going to look outside? And maybe more broadly on the portfolio, your already diversified compactors seem to be getting more diversified for saying at announcements starting today. Any broader, higher-level thoughts about the portfolio longer term?", "David Dvorak", "Sure, Rick, we like our existing portfolio. And our fundamental strategy launching due to the experience that we have in the third quarter of this year. We're going to continue to focus on executing our plan. Again, within the recon space, we think that we have great opportunities and some of this can lead to informing our views as to what external development might look like to move up and down that continuum of care as well as emerging markets. And so you can see that we've announced an acquisition in China that is pending at this point in time, and that's consistent with our growth strategy for the recon market. So again, up and down the continuum of care on the recon side in emerging markets. And then beyond that, we have excellent opportunities in these other product categories. And I think that as early in the fourth quarter, you're going to start seeing some progress to be made in one or two of those other business units. Coming back to your Spine question, I think that, that's one that is to win there, we're going to have to do well both on internal as well as external development to ensure that we've got the right kind of product pipeline. So we've got a pretty significant commitment at this point in time on internal development. And just recently, we launched on a limited basis an excellent MIS system, the Pathfinder system. It was well received. We think that we're going to make good progress in that category and have an excellent overall portfolio with MIS solutions within the Spine business. But to continue to make progress on that market, it's a big market. It's one that we think we can create a lot of value win for the shareholders and provide some good solutions for patients. The success rates are much lower at this point in time, so there is a lot of room for innovation that can make a difference for patients in that category. And we want to be one of the companies providing those solutions going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Charles Chon with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Charles Chon - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "When adjusting for the revenue contribution from the Abbott Spine acquisition last year, the fourth quarter actually faces a tougher year-over-year growth comp on a constant currency basis, which is what we saw on the third quarter and you expect revenues to be flat to up 2%. So just wondering would you be willing to speak to the confidence that you have in the fourth quarter guidance? Is there something that you saw on the exiting trends from the 3Q that lands to the visibility for the fourth quarter here?", "David Dvorak", "Actually, the anniversary-ing out of the Abbott spine acquisition essentially is complete by the end of the third quarter. So there isn't anything to factor in on that front. We're confident in the guidance that we provide. We know that people place a lot of value and are making investment decisions. And so subject to all the front-end qualifiers, with Safe Harbor statements, that's our guidance. It's well informed. And those are the results that we expect to achieve.", "Charles Chon - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Would you be willing to talk to then maybe what sort of trends you saw on the third quarter as you exited the quarter, just give us a sense of what kind of velocity we saw from the underlying business?", "David Dvorak", "Yes, Charles, that question was asked and answered already. And we just didn't see much of a difference at different points in time. During that third quarter, it was a pretty consistently slow procedure rate that we had a view throughout the third quarter.", "Charles Chon - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Maybe shifting the focus away from Europe and EMEA, outside the U.S. Could you talk to the market dynamics in some of the emerging regions, like the BRIC countries? The sort of growth rates and growth rates and growth dynamics are we seeing in those territories? And any chance we can wrestle some granularity on pricing mix from those regions as well?", "David Dvorak", "Well, I'll talk to you about growth rates. I mean, the BRIC nations all provide excellent opportunities for us. And right now, you're seeing growth rates that are double digits in those markets and it would stand a reason that, that would be the case because they're very underpenetrated at this point in time. If you look at the opportunity to bring these solutions to patients, it's a large, large population basis and very low-penetration rates. And so there's a lot of infrastructure oftentimes to be developed. These are markets that each one of them is different, there are different product tierings and price points and service levels. And so you really can't speak in general terms beyond if you look at those population bases and the penetration rates that currently exist and start to do some math around that and you see big opportunities going forward. So those are markets where as a global leader, we want to have a significant level of participation going forward. And I think that we can drive a lot of growth and improve the quality of life per patients that live in those jurisdictions.", "James Crines", "Celeste, in the interest of everyone's time, let's take one more caller.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.", "Matthew Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Just trying to understand what's happening or what happened in Knees. It's a question for David. It sounds like either because of your transition to instruments or maybe because of the push into Hips, which is moving a little slower and pricing that it seems like the Knee business is kind of caught in a little bit of a transition tier. Is that part of it in addition to all the market pressures that you're seeing, and everyone is seeing? I'm just trying to reconcile the sequential slowing of your business relative to the sequential slowing of some of the other players in this space. Were there just some transitional alliance between new product launches? Jim, you mentioned upgrading instruments, is there sort of logistical issues holding back the business or making this a tougher transition for you?", "James Crines", "I don't think they're logistical. But the essence of the theory, I think is a fair one that we put it, Matt. But these are execution matters that we intend to resolve. It is not a limitation on a great product with great clinical results, so we don't have a challenge in that respect. It is the case that within the psyche of the sales force in the marketing organizations that if there's a hot new product, there's going to be at disproportionate amount of time and attention dedicated to that. But that's always a balance that we have to strike. And I think that we look to improve our execution, and we think we have a great opportunity to do that as we launch these new estimates. Those instrument launches, and you know this industry well, Matt, they take time whether it's an instrument or a product launch. And so we literally started that process in Q3. So you're not going to see any benefit in Q3 and you're likely to see modest benefit from that kind of an initiative in Q4. But it's all the base work and planting the seeds that are going to put us in a better position to accelerate that growth as we exit this year get into 2011.", "Matthew Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies", "In moving forward out of Q4 and into 2011, as you walk through to get through these issues, I guess, what and when are the first couple of things that we're going to see that will tell us that here's a conviction that you're going to fight your way back to market growth rates and mid-single growth rates. When and what should we expect to see that will indicate that you're getting there?", "David Dvorak", "I think, clear improvement in our Knee performance. And beyond that, continued acceleration in some of the product categories where we've emphasized new product launches and I think we have great opportunities. So we ought to be talk about that in the Q4 call as it relates to Hips, and we ought to be talking about that in the Q4 call as it relates to Trauma as well, Matt.", "Matthew Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies", "And last, just quick on that point of Knee. Is there anything about the new patient match technology that you're rolling out that's holding you back? Are the instruments that you're rolling out critical to making that successful? Or is that an area where we might see some improvement this quarter?", "David Dvorak", "We continue to ramp up and execute relatively well on the Patient Specific Instruments side. I think that an opportunity that we have is to combine those two, Matt, where we take the Patient Specific Instruments, we're getting good clinical feedback and continuing to refine those systems and expand them. But you get into connecting that offering with the posterior referencing instruments, and now you've got something that's differentiated for competitive surgeons and yet a familiar surgical philosophy to that surgeon. And I think that can be pretty powerful when you layer on top of that the best-performing Knee system in the world.", "Matthew Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies", "But if I hear that, that doesn't sound like it will come together in Q4. It will come together as you move through 2011, is that fair?", "David Dvorak", "The offering exists at this point in time. So again, it's a matter of rolling those systems out and getting the attention of surgeons and trialing and converting business.", "David Dvorak", "Thanks, again, everyone for joining us today and for your continued interest in Zimmer. We look forward to speaking to you on our Fourth Quarter Conference Call on January 27 at 8:00 a.m. I'll now turn the call back to you, Celeste.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this  concludes today's call.

", "A rebroadcast of this call will be available from approximately two hours following the conclusion of today's call through the end of the day on February 10, 2011, and can also be accessed from the Investor Relations section of the Zimmer website. ", "At this time, I'd like to introduce David Dvorak, President and Chief Executive Officer of Zimmer.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. We're glad you've joined us on the call today. This morning, I'll review our fourth quarter financial results and provide comments on several highlights from the quarter and the full year of 2010. Jim will then provide additional financial detail, as well as our 2011 guidance. Except as otherwise noted, I'll state all sales in constant currency terms and I'll discuss all earnings results on an adjusted basis. ", "In the fourth quarter, we improved top line sales and delivered a strong bottom line performance with solid earnings and cash flow. Successful execution of product launches throughout the year helped us finish out 2010 with sequential improvement in nearly all of our businesses. In fact, the only business that did not produce sequential sales growth improvement was Zimmer Surgical, which generated solid growth of 8%. Our results in the quarter and full year reflect continued progress in the execution of our strategic agenda as we drive growth in revenues, earnings and cash flow through performance improvement initiatives. ", "Moving into 2011, we're well positioned to further advance this agenda, strengthen our leadership position in joint reconstruction and increase share in our emerging businesses and geographic markets. Net sales for the quarter were $1.13 billion, an increase of 3.0% and our earnings per share were $1.27, an increase of 13.4% over the prior-year period. Full year 2000 (sic) [2010] sales were $4.2 billion, an increase of 2.3% and our full year 2010 earnings per share were $4.33, an increase of 9.9% over the prior year. ", "For the fourth quarter, we experienced balanced year-over-year sales growth in all of our geographic segments. Americas grew 3.1%, Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 2.7% and Asia Pacific, again, led our segments with sales growth of 3.2%. We delivered improved sequential performance in our Knee business, with Knee sales for the fourth quarter increasing year-over-year 0.3%, reflecting positive volume and mix of 2.3% and negative price of 2.0%. Recognizing that we have more work to do, we believe that our Knee business is positioned for further improvement based on ongoing instrumentation launches and future product development. ", "Patient Specific Instruments and Posterior Referencing Instruments for our Legacy systems, which remain the most widely utilized and clinically successful Knees in the world, should enhance our ability to win in the marketplace. Hip sales increased 3.6% in the fourth quarter, reflecting positive volume and mix of 5.6% and negative price of 2.0%. The encouraging performance of our Hip business was supported by strong sales in the Americas, which delivered 6.3% growth. ", "Of particular note was the performance of our Continuum Acetabular Cup System, which enjoyed substantial sales growth in the quarter. This innovative system enables surgeons to choose between bearing surfaces to match patients' lifestyle demands. The positive impact of product launches in many of our businesses in 2010 demonstrates how strategic innovation, combined with solid sales execution, leads to enhanced growth as evidenced by the performance of our Hip business. ", "Extremity products posted healthy results for the quarter with sales growth of 10.4%. Once again, the quarter's results were supported by sales of the Trabecular Metal Reverse Shoulder System and the Trabecular Metal Glenoid. The performance of these products is another example of the differentiating impact of our proprietary Trabecular Metal Technology, which we are utilizing broadly across our entire portfolio. ", "Our Dental business outpaced the sector once again, delivering impressive double-digit growth of 13.1% in the fourth quarter. This represents solid organic growth of 5.6%, as well as the impact of our amended RTI sourcing relationship, which will anniversary out later this year. The management team at our Dental business has done a great job in driving our performance in a market that experienced procedure pressure resulting from global economic conditions. ", "Trauma sales in the quarter were up 8.6% over the prior-year period, with all three of our geographic segments contributing to this growth. The performance of our Trauma business once again demonstrates the positive impact of successful product introductions. ", "Throughout 2010, we continued to roll out new components of our Zimmer Natural Nail family, including the Cephalomedullary Nail, as well as antegrade and retrograde femoral nails. Our Zimmer Natural Nail products experienced significant sales growth in the quarter and are proven to be real door openers for our global sales teams. ", "The fourth quarter also saw increased penetration of the NCB Periprosthetic Plating System, the only comprehensive solution in the market to address complex femoral fractures that can occur around the knee or a hip implant. ", "Zimmer Spine reported a sales decrease of 3.9% in the quarter. The Spine business continues to face challenges related to reimbursement and pricing, particularly in the United States. However, this remains an attractive market with significant long-term potential globally. During the fourth quarter, our Spine business outside of the Americas generated 11.3% sales growth. We're confident that a newly established management team is well equipped to return our Spine business to positive performance, supported by a strong lineup of new products to be introduced in 2011, including our percutaneous MIS pedicle screw system, PATHFINDER NXT. ", "In the fourth quarter, our Zimmer Surgical and other category generated 6.7% growth. The Zimmer Surgical business continues to perform well, with growth led by our bone cement, wound debridement and tourniquet products. In December, we also announced the acquisition of the SoPlus product line of surgical power equipment. This strategic acquisition broadens Zimmer's portfolio of surgical power tools, with large and small bone systems in consumables and will strengthen the company's position in this more than $1 billion market. ", "Turning now from our product category results, I'd like to discuss several broad market factors. While we continue to face some pressure in the fourth quarter, pricing improved relative to the third quarter and remained stable. For the full year 2010, we experienced a pricing decrease of 1%, which is at the low end of our expectation coming into 2010. There are a number of factors affecting pricing. Of particular relevance is compression, where historic pricing differentials within certain markets such as the U.S. narrow. As we manage through this dynamic, we do not currently anticipate accelerated pricing erosion. We would rather expect the pricing trend to remain relatively stable. ", "Moreover, we believe our markets will continue to reward innovation with higher reimbursements and premium pricing. By way of example, Zimmer has secured premium reimbursement for the Trabecular Metal Modular Cup product in the Japanese market based on the robust long-term clinical and mechanical data supporting this technology. In addition, our Americas' Hip results for the fourth quarter reflect a significant increase in mix related to new products, which contributed to the sequential increase and sales growth of 360 basis points. In recent quarters, a number of our businesses have faced pressure from reduced procedural volumes as a result of global economic conditions. In the fourth quarter, we saw some stabilization of procedure volumes and expect further recovery as the global economy strengthens. ", "However, recent headwinds do not diminish the extraordinary long-term potential of our industry. It's well known that demographic trends will expand the patient base seeking the treatments we provide in developed markets. It is also important to recognize that our solutions help take costs out of these healthcare systems to reduce long-term disease management. ", "Consequently, we're well positioned to respond to the needs of all stakeholders, from government and private payers to surgeons and their patients, which will ultimately lead to sustained long-term growth. Additionally, a number of emerging markets will also significantly increase the potential patient base. Our fourth quarter acquisition of Beijing Montagne Medical Device Company in China establishes a broader leadership position for Zimmer in this key market. ", "In summary, Zimmer's performance in the quarter and in 2010 was characterized by successful commercial execution of product introductions across our portfolio. Key products introduced in 2010 reflect the overall direction of our innovation pipeline. We're developing products that address the breadth of the musculoskeletal continuum of care and that are designed to enable surgeons to customize treatments to the unique needs of their patients. Our results, including improved operating margins and strong cash flow, are a reflection of continued financial discipline. These are key features of our strategic agenda under which rigorous management of our operations and support functions provide the opportunity for investment in strategic growth drivers and leverage in the P&L. As Jim will discuss, we expect to further increase our investment in research and development in 2011, while maintaining industry-leading profit margins. ", "I'll now turn the call over to Jim, who will provide further details on the quarter and our guidance. Jim?", "James Crines", "Thanks, David. I will review our fourth quarter financial performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our 2011 full year sales and earnings guidance. As David mentioned, our total revenues for the quarter were $1,135,000,000, a 3% constant currency increase compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Net currency impact for the quarter was slightly negative, decreasing revenues by an additional 0.5% or $5.6 million. The unfavorable currency impact from our euro-denominated sales in the quarter was partially offset by a favorable currency impact from our Japanese yen and Australian dollar denominated revenues. ", "Our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.8% for the quarter. The margin ratio improved 30 basis points compared to fourth quarter 2009. Manufacturing efficiencies and lower excess and obsolescence charges, offset by hedge losses in the quarter account for the improvement in gross margin compared to prior year. ", "R&D expense increased 10% on a reported basis when compared to the prior year and in spite of the double-digit increase in spending, R&D expense remained at the low end of our targeted range of 5% to 6%. We expect R&D expense to continue to grow in line with our strategy to direct more investment into new product development activities and clinical programs. ", "Selling, general and administrative expenses were $461 million in the fourth quarter and, at 40.6% of sales, were 100 basis points below prior year. Reduced spending on third-party fees and expenses and general and administrative functions enabled us to hold total SG&A expense for the fourth quarter flat to prior year, in spite of volume-related increases in selling and distribution costs. ", "Special items, which were formerly referred to as acquisition, integration, realignment and other, amounted to $16 million in the quarter. These expenses include integration costs from our recently completed acquisitions of Beijing Montagne and Sodem Diffusion and similar cost stemming from distributor acquisitions in our Europe, Middle East and Africa segment. ", "As indicated in our release, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $204 million in the fourth quarter related to our U.S. Spine reporting unit. The impairment is a noncash charge and is not deductible for tax purposes. So the charge amounts to $1.03 per diluted share on an after-tax basis. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the full carrying value of the reporting unit may not be recoverable. In accordance with accounting policies, as described in our periodic SEC filing, we performed the annual tests for impairment in the fourth quarter due to the change in the long-term outlook for the Spine market in the U.S., as well as decreased projected revenues related to the Dynesys Dynamic Stabilization System and competitive challenges, the estimated discount of future cash flows for our U.S. Spine reporting unit were negatively impacted, causing the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit to be lower than the carrying value. We calculated the fair value of goodwill and determined that the goodwill assigned to U.S. Spine was impaired. ", "Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased to $343 million. At 30.2%, our adjusted operating profit to sales ratio is 100 basis points higher than the prior-year fourth quarter and reflects the benefits of operational improvements in manufacturing and certain of our back-office functions. Net interest expense for the quarter amounted to $13.4 million compared to $8.7 million in the prior-year quarter. The change is primarily due to the $1 billion senior unsecured notes offering we completed in November of 2009. ", "Adjusted net earnings were $251 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 6.1% compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 13.4% to $1.27 on 197.4 million average outstanding diluted shares. These adjusted earnings per share are inclusive of approximately $0.06 of share-based compensation. At $0.18 reported diluted earnings per share, which include the charges reflected in the goodwill impairment and special items, decreased 76% from prior-year fourth quarter reported EPS of $0.74. ", "Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.9% and our full year 2010 adjusted tax rate was 25.8%. The lower tax rate reflects a number of factors, including: more favorable mix of earnings and profits; the effect of tax law changes enacted in the fourth quarter that extended the U.S. R&D tax credit; tax benefits from the first full year of production out of our China and Ireland facility; and the effective resolution of certain international tax contingencies. ", "During the quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares at a total purchase price of $101 million. As of December 31, 2010, approximately $1.2 billion remained authorized under $1.5 billion repurchase program which expires at the end of 2013. The company had approximately 196 million shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2010, down from 204 million as of December 31, 2009. Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $341 million, down 13% from $386 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. ", "Net inventories were $935 million at the end of the fourth quarter, an increase of $22 million over the fourth quarter prior year. Adjusted inventory days on hand finished the quarter at 307 days, an increase of five days compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. As of year-end 2010, net receivables increased to $776 million from $751 million in 2009 or 3% over prior year. Our adjusted trade accounts receivable days sales outstanding finished the quarter at 58 days, an increase of two days over the fourth quarter of 2009. Depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter amounted to $91 million. ", "Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was $243 million, $93 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2009. We define free cash flow as operating cash flow less cash outflows for instruments and property, plants and equipments. The change in free cash flow compared with the prior-year fourth quarter resulted from increased investments in inventory and instruments in support of ongoing new product launches. ", "Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $98 million, including $59 million for instruments and $39 million for property, plants and equipments. Cash outlays associated with investing activities during the quarter include: $92 million for acquisitions and licenses, including Beijing Montagne, Sodem Diffusion and amended license and distribution agreement with RTI and certain international distributor acquisitions. ", "I'd like to turn now to our guidance for 2011. In our earnings release this morning, we announced that the company expects full year revenues to increase between 2% and 4% in constant currency when compared to 2010. At this time, assuming currency rates remain near recent levels, we anticipate foreign currency translation will increase our reported 2011 revenues by an estimated 1%. Therefore, on a reported basis, our revenues are projected to be between 3% and 5% above 2010 results. ", "Among our market assumptions for 2011, we believe that full year knee and hip procedures will grow in the low single digits. We expect market growth to be lower in the first half than the second half of 2011 due to more challenging comps. Our market growth assumption anticipates modest global economic growth and relatively stable employment. However, a significant improvement in employment levels, especially in the U.S., and a related step-up in enrollment in private health plans would lead us to take a more bullish view towards market growth. ", "With regard to pricing for 2011, we assume that price compression within our Reconstructive business will continue, and pricing trends for the company will remain at a level consistent with 2010 or between minus 1% and minus 2%. ", "Moving down the income statement. Assuming currency rates remain near recent levels, we expect our gross margin ratio to be approximately 75%. This takes into account anticipated losses on foreign currency hedges, resulting from relative weakness in the U.S. dollar, as well as some downward pressure on manufacturing volumes as we anniversary out of large pipeline inventory builds that occurred in 2010. As indicated in my earlier remarks, we target R&D expense to average between 5% and 6% of sales. And as we direct more investment toward product development and clinical programs in 2011, R&D should begin trending toward the higher end of the range. ", "SG&A is expected to be between 40% and 41% of sales for the year as we realize operational efficiencies from the global restructuring and transformation initiatives and further leverage revenue growth. We expect to incur lower interest expense in 2011, as we recently concluded an interest rate swap for $250 million of our 10-year fixed rate debt to variable rate. Assuming variable rates remain near recent levels, we expect interest and other expense of around $50 million in 2011. ", "We anticipate a 2011 full year tax rate of approximately 27%, 120 basis points above our final rate for 2010. This projected increase is primarily due to a larger proportion of our earnings and profits anticipated from higher tax jurisdictions, as well as the resolution of certain tax contingencies which we recognized in 2010 that will not repeat in 2011. We anticipate the diluted weighted average shares outstanding for 2011 to be between 192 million and 193 million shares. Therefore, 2011 full year adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be in a range of $4.60 to $4.80. ", "As indicated in our release, we expect to record pretax charges of $75 million to $80 million within the 2011 operating period related to restructuring and transformation initiative. We also expect to incur an additional $15 million to $20 million for certain acquisition and integration costs connected with the acquisition of third-party distributors and the recently completed acquisitions of Beijing Montagne Medical Device company and Sodem Diffusion S.A. Therefore to arrive at our anticipated reported GAAP earnings per share, you should subtract total charges for special items of $90 million to $100 million pretax or approximately $0.33 to $0.37 per share. ", "Turning to cash flow. We anticipate total capital expenditures for the year to be in a range of $250 million to $270 million. Instrument capital is expected to be in a range of $140 million to $150 million. Traditional PP&E is expected to be in a range of $110 million to $120 million, reflecting the cash outlays necessary to drive new product development activities, as well as the replacement of older machinery and equipment in the normal course of operations. Our guidance assumes that we will utilize $500 million of cash flow for share repurchases during the year. Free cash flow in excess of this $500 million is assumed to be held in cash and cash equivalents. Estimated depreciation and amortization expense for the year is in a range of $370 million to $380 million. Finally, please note that our guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or other unforeseen events. ", "David, I'll turn the call back over to you.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you, Jim. Zimmer's performance in 2010 was generally in line with our expectations, notwithstanding a challenging economy. Throughout the year, we made progress on a number of key initiatives that will enable us to more effectively drive sustained growth in sales, earnings and cash flow. However, we won't be satisfied until we make greater headway toward our long-term strategic goals, namely expanding Zimmer's leadership in our Reconstructive businesses, while achieving increased market share in each of the emerging businesses and geographic markets. These goals will be realized through continued financial discipline in managing the bottom line and improved performance in product development and commercial execution. Through continued focus on these fundamental strategic priorities, we expect to realize our aspirations for future growth sustained at or above market growth rates in all of our businesses. ", "And now I'd like to ask Christie to begin the Q&A portion of our call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Robert Hopkins", "So two questions. One for you David, then one for Jim. First, David, I just want to make sure I had the math right. On your assumptions for Hip, Knee market growth for 2011, is -- netting out all the different moving parts that you just talked about, are you suggesting, you think, the Hip and Knee market will be roughly sort of a 0% to 1% to 2% grower in 2011, is that right?", "David Dvorak", "In that range, Bob. I mean, we're thinking that it's lower single digits and then if the economy comes back stronger it could rise above that. But at this point in time, I think that, that's the best assumption to build in the models.", "Robert Hopkins", "And then also, David, is it safe to assume that you think 2011 is a year where we're going to see a pickup in M&A activity on the part of Zimmer? And then for Jim, could you break down those $0.44 of special items that are included or excluded from the -- sorry, I should say, part of the adjusted guidance. So just breakdown those $0.44 for us in terms of the moving parts.", "David Dvorak", "Yes, Bob, we are active obviously on the external development front, and we'll continue to be active throughout 2011. We're focused on the musculoskeletal space and so the types of deals that you saw at the end of the year are ones that you should expect in the future. And if we can find deals that make good strategic sense and can structure and price those, you could see some things that are larger than those small deals that we did at the end of the year. But those are just ongoing efforts and we'll take a disciplined approach and create value where we see the opportunities to do so.", "James Crines", "So Bob, on the restructuring and transformation initiatives. First of all, the $75 million to $80 million of charges we have projected related to those initiatives will include employee termination benefits, contract termination fees, facility closing costs and potential impairment charges for assets taken out of service fee. And the benefits from these programs, as we indicated in the release, are estimated at $100 million on an annualized basis, with $40 million to $50 million to be realized in 2010. I would tell you that we expect the benefits to be somewhat evenly distributed between cost of goods and selling, general and administrative expenses. The programs, so you understand, will affect all of our businesses in all of our geographic segments. Just to give you some flavor for what we're doing, among the initiatives there's a delayering of the organization which is designed to reduced management layers, bring our commercial and functional leaders a step or two closer to their customers, enhance communication throughout the organization and achieve tighter alignment on strategic priorities. With this program, we expect our operational execution to improve as managers with greater spans of control are in a better position to leverage the company's resources. Other initiatives include a consolidation of sourcing activities across all categories of spend and with the recent recruitment of new talent to the organization, with expertise in the areas of sourcing and based on some pilot work completed in 2010, we believe we can drive significant savings by centralizing our global sourcing activities. So hopefully that gives you some idea of what we have in mind.", "Robert Hopkins", "Is there a number of staff reductions this year that you're willing to provide?", "James Crines", "I would tell you this. We're farthest along with the delayering initiative, and that is something that we expect to be completed in the first quarter. So we'll be able to provide more specific information as the programs are implemented.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Feinstein of Barclays Capital.", "Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital", "For your outlook, can you talk about the margin outlook in a little bit more detail? So just trying to understand how you're thinking about margins for next year.", "James Crines", "Sure. So Adam, first of all, on gross margin, our guidance for gross margin for 2011 reflects some headwind from anticipated hedge losses, as well as some pressure on volumes as we anniversary out the large pipeline inventory builds that occurred in 2010. And we're also experiencing slower procedure growth relative to historical norms. And finally, we are engaged in ongoing efforts to drive our field-based operations toward greater efficiency in the management of our working capital. And in that respect, we do expect to suffer some temporary inefficiencies in manufacturing as we burn off excess inventory in the field. As far as getting further down into the P&L, our guidance implies a modest amount of leverage at the operating profit line in spite of some temporary headwinds on gross margin. In 2011, we are planning to invest some but not all of the savings from the restructuring and transformation initiatives into product development and clinical programs. And the increased investments in R&D are certainly going to help us strengthen our leadership position in our core Reconstructive business, increase share in emerging businesses and markets and put us in a position to, as David talked about, deliver sustained growth in revenues, earnings and cash flow. Beyond 2011, assuming we grow revenues at or above market, opportunity for leverage will be enhanced. We expect to anniversary out of the gross margin headwinds and realize the full annualized benefits from the restructuring and transformation initiatives. And then finally for 2011, keep in mind that we have also guided lower interest expense and a reduction of over 4% in a projected average share count compared with 2010.", "Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital", "So just saw a pretty nice bounce back relative to the third quarter, and I know you talked about the procedure volumes. But just curious, Q3 just seemed to be pretty weak and then once again seeing the bounce back here, were you guys surprised by just the magnitude of just the improvement relative to the third quarter in terms of the revenue growth? And just curious, any more color in terms of, do you think the market growth picked up as well?", "David Dvorak", "I think that we were doing all the right things throughout the year, Adam. And I think the slowdown that we saw from the first half of the year into the third quarter procedure rate-wise was a difficult environment to get as much traction as we wanted to get in launching the new products. So you could see another quarter pass, then a little bit more of a stabilized market environment. We saw nice traction in the launching of those new products and a lot of productivity coming from those launches. And so that's really what drove our performance improvement at that point in time. I don't know that it was as much driven by a pick back up in procedure rates. I think more stabilization of those procedure rates and productivity of those new introductions.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein of JP Morgan.", "Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "So let me just clarify, so how do you view your market growth? Let me put it this way, how do you view your 2011 guidance relative to underlying market growth in your end markets? Are you modeling it as if you're growing in line with your end markets, above, below? How should we think about that?", "David Dvorak", "Yes, at or a bit above, Mike, is I think the right way to think about it. We clearly anticipate that in some of these categories where we've had successful new product launches that began in 2010 in earnest, that we're going to be able to take market share. So we'd expect to take market share in categories like Hips and Trauma. We obviously have a bit more work to do to get to market in Knees, but we think we're well positioned with the new product introductions in the area of instrumentation to close that gap and perform well in that category as well as the year progresses.", "Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "One, on the share repurchase, the $500 million for 2011. Why is that the right amount? Why not more? You certainly could do more. You could obviously do less as well. Why is $500 million the right number for 2011 relative to how you're thinking about the year? And then second, why is it given your market commentary and what we're seeing in some of the various orthopaedic end markets, why is the best use of cash or a good use of cash to make acquisitions at this time?", "James Crines", "To answer the first question, Mike, we can always do more and whether or not we do more will depend in part on our ability to access that cash. We generate a lot of cash, as you know, outside the U.S. In some cases, that cash -- our intent is to reinvest that cash in the business outside the U.S. and have no intent to have that repatriated to the U.S., which is what we would have to do to deploy it towards share repurchases. So that's certainly something we take into account in arriving at we think -- at what we believe is a very appropriate and still reasonably aggressive share repurchase program at the $500 million level.", "Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "David, do you want to just comment on acquisitions and why do you want to buy into some of these end markets right now, given the challenges you're facing?", "David Dvorak", "Again, these markets, the procedure rates are clearly suppressed right now with the macroeconomic conditions, Mike. But none of that is going to change the medium- and long-term prospects for these markets. You go through the demographic analysis and we believe that the strength of the baby boomer population is still out there. There aren't alternative solutions for advanced stage osteoarthritis. So across the musculoskeletal care space, you're seeing that our ability to drive reasonably decent earnings growth numbers off of a suppressed procedure rate and that rate is only going to get better if the economy stabilizes and improves over time. So the prospects within this industry are excellent going forward, and this is the world that we live in and we like the space and think that we can provide better solutions for patients and take market share in the process and create a lot of value for our stockholders as well.", "Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "So if I could summarize this. You think that as we go forward and I'm talking beyond just 2011, that volumes improve in orthopaedic end markets but that pricing in our mix don't get worse, so that they don't necessarily offset that improvement work you're expecting volumes.", "David Dvorak", "Absolutely. We still think that there's a lot of room for innovation. We're seeing that in our Hip business right now, getting good returns in the mix category, offsetting any price pressure that exists. We don't see that price pressure growing. We think that, that's going to be manageable going forward and so long as we're innovating in the right way, we think that we're going to be performing very well in a space that is going to be accelerating as the economy improves.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell of UBS.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS Investment Bank", "Just returning to that, so we had talked about a quarter ago and you had basically -- Dave held the view that net ASPs can be held at neutral. Just do you think -- and the market, the picture of the market today is distorted by the negative mix suffered by J&J and Biomet, especially in Hips. So if beyond that, where would project net ASPs over the next, let's say, five years might be?", "David Dvorak", "Bruce, I do think that you're going to see ASPs stabilize. If you talk about pure price, I think that you're going to see those prices stabilize if the company is doing the right thing to manage through this transition period. And I think that we are doing the right things in that regard. I think that the broader price definition to include mix is going to be all about innovation and innovating in a highly relevant way, which is why you see us pushing more and more resources towards our spend in the research and development area, as well as the clinical support for those developments and those innovations. And I think if we execute our plans well, we're going to be in a nice position in an environment where ultimately you're going to see procedure rates pick back up. You're going to see pricing moderate and stabilize and then the mix opportunities are going to be there, and we're going to be back to a more normalized state for this industry.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS Investment Bank", "But I guess to push the issue, do you think there'll be net positive ASPs or neutral ASPs? What's -- for modeling purposes, internally how do you guys think about it?", "David Dvorak", "I think that where we're in a position to rollout a new product, we still think that we can offset price and then some with mix.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS Investment Bank", "So slight positive in aggregate?", "David Dvorak", "That's right. So long as you\u2019re innovating with the right cadence, that's right, Bruce.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS Investment Bank", "And is it still correct to think about -- could you describe the volume trends around the world like as the economy stabilizes, where do you see the developed markets in terms of volume growth? And where do you see over a five-year period and where do you see the rest of the world, the developing world in terms of volume growth?", "David Dvorak", "I think within the developed markets, you need to look at those procedure rates as going from low single digits to more mid-single digits as the economies stabilize globally. The procedure rate growth within the developing or emerging markets is going to be way in excess of that because the penetration rates are so much lower at this point in time. So there's significant opportunities and it's one of the reasons that you see us making investments in those markets and really emphasizing our emerging market strategic plan and executing that plan.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS Investment Bank", "How should we think about the ASPs in developing markets? I mean, if a hip or a knee in the United States is $6,000, where's a hip and knee in China?", "David Dvorak", "The Hip and Knee -- you really need to stratify those markets. In the high end of the market, there are very competitive prices. And so new technologies and cutting-edge technologies can be introduced in those markets very successfully. If you get into the middle portion of those markets, which in instances are some of the fastest-growing subsets of the markets and those price points are going to be lower and the service that's provided with the products and the technologies are going to have to be introduced in a way where you can hit that price point and maintain your margins. But we think that, that's doable. At the end of the day, the EBIT margins can be preserved so long as you have the right go-to-market strategies within that space.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.", "Steve Beuchaw - Wachovia", "It's Steve Beuchaw in for David. I wanted to ask a bit of a follow up effectively to the line of questions that Bruce is going down regarding pricing. Not so much over the longer term but for 2011, I'm wondering what are the data points that you're looking at that give you this very high level of confidence in the stability of the pricing environment? What do you think are the key indicators, are these tenders? Is it something about the dynamics of healthcare systems? Can you give us a sense for what it is you're looking at?", "James Crines", "Sure. And understand that we measure changes at an SKU level and report that out publicly and we have done that historically, unlike some of our peers who sometimes combine discussions around price with mix. And in the U.S. market and in certain cases, this is also true outside the U.S., pricing decisions are generally made at a local level subject to guidelines and reviewed by a corporate contract management group. And when we look at contract prices for our end plants across all of our hospital accounts in the U.S. as an example, we know there is and there has historically been some variability, just given the fact that these pricing decisions again are being made at a local level. Now we're not going to answer questions as to just how much variability exists, since the metric is something that's constantly changing and it's very dynamic, particularly in this environment. But just to give you an idea, we have looked at prices for a number of our Hip and Knee devices over the last two years. And in some cases, and this is illustrative so keep that in mind, looking back to 2008, we had somewhere in the order of say 20% of our accounts at price points above a median price point and we roll those analyses forward to 2010, so generally more than half of those accounts have been migrated to a lower price point on the curve. So we know that's something that will continue through 2011, but as our price curves are narrowing to the point where this is something that we can see abating as we get beyond 2011.", "Steve Beuchaw - Wachovia", "One of the other drivers of your confidence in the 2011 outlook is your expectation for performance above the market just to generalize. I wonder if you might be able to get a little bit more granular on that point, specifically the impact of Metal-on-Metal Hips and the scrutiny that we've seen there now for the better part of the year. And to what extent do you see Metal-on-Metal as a driver -- the pressure on Metal-on-Metal that is, as a driver of market share shift, both in Hips and for your Orthopaedic Recon business more broadly? How much of a factor would you suggest that was in the quarter and in your outlook for 2011?", "David Dvorak", "Sure. Clearly, it's an opportunity for our company and one of the big reasons that it's an opportunity for our company is we didn't have a large share of that market to begin with. So we just don't face the headwind that others might face in that regard. But more importantly, we feel like we have a great portfolio to address the needs of these patients. We have one of the best-performing crosslinked polyethylene products in Longevity within that category and you couple that with the new launches of Continuum Trabecular Metal Technology and some very innovative and advanced stems including the Fitmore Stem and M/L Taper with Kinectiv Technology, and those are all the reasons that we're driving market share gain within our Hip portfolio. And we think that the circumstances within the environment with respect to Metal-on-Metal are just going to expand those opportunities for us going forward. So we like our position within the Hip space.", "Steve Beuchaw - Wachovia", "And just to clarify, that's unit share, correct?", "David Dvorak", "That's right, unit share and as we talked about, mix opportunity as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank.", "Rob Wisniewski", "It's Rob filling in for Kristen. Could you guys comment on the difference in pricing in the quarter maybe across Americas, Europe and Japan and Asia?", "David Dvorak", "Sure. As far as just what goes into the 1% decline in pricing overall, Rob?", "Rob Wisniewski", "Yes.", "David Dvorak", "The breakout is minus 1.2% in the Americas, which is a step down from 1.6% in Q3. In Europe, plus 0.6% in price which is a step-up from flat pricing in Q3. And then in Asia Pacific, minus 3.4%, which is an increase from minus 2.9% in Q3. So again, we went from minus 1.4% globally to minus 1.0% in Q4.", "Rob Wisniewski", "And then regarding the pricing guidance, I know you guys commented on pricing being down 1% to 2% and being stable. Given that Japan pricing got to anniversary, that should kind of help out the year-over-year comparisons. What are you assuming for the American and the European markets? Can you comment on that?", "David Dvorak", "We're not going to provide that breakout just because there's a lot that goes into that. So we think that, that's the right range to build in for modeling purposes. But you're right, within Asia Pacific, anniversary-ing out of that significant price cut after Q1 is going to be helpful.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Charlie Chon of Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Charles Chon - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "You spoke to the stabilizing of procedural patterns throughout the quarter. So it seems as if we saw a typical year-end seasonality as you conclude 2010. But as we move into the first quarter, what can we expect there? Could you give us a little guidance on how to think about what the year-over-year growth trends could look like, especially since we do run up against another healthy growth comp comparison?", "David Dvorak", "You're right about that. And I just don't know that we saw as much of a spike in the fourth quarter as we had in some of the prior years. That increased procedure rate that has been driven, the theory behind it is that the expanded deductibles at the personal level have increased procedures in the fourth quarter. And while we continue to hear of that in an anecdotal fashion, the numbers in the aggregate just don't really bear that out in Q4. So I think that Q4 can be looked at as a little bit more of a normal state for where we are in the economic recovery broadly. And moving into the first quarter, I would expect those procedure rates to look relatively similar. You're right in the sense of the first half of the year with tougher comps and so I think everyone expects the growth rates to pick up in the second half of the year as we work through those comps because some of the things that impacted the downturn towards the end of the first half of last year, start to anniversary out including COBRA in the United States and the effects that, that extension of the program had on the marketplace. So I do think that one should anticipate an accelerating market performance in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year.", "Charles Chon - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "There were some opportunities to take advantage of disruptions for some of your competitors. Just out of curiosity, how much of a positive impact was that for Zimmer? And our channel checks speak to how there may have been some incremental procedure mix shift towards revision surgeries. Just out of curiosity, is it possible that Zimmer's Hip performance could be attributed to that phenomenon in any way?", "David Dvorak", "I don't think that, that was a material driver, Charlie. I mean, I do think that those circumstances have a bunch of collateral opportunities attached them for our business going forward. But I don't think that, that was the primary driver for our performance in Hips in Q4.", "Charles Chon - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Just moving on to R&D, especially as I move to the upper end of the historic 5% to 6% of sales for 2011. Does that in any way imply a faster product cadence here going forward? Or is this more just investing in white space opportunities to generate mix and regain share over the intermediate to longer term?", "David Dvorak", "It's a mix of investments, but we clearly are investing in a way where we expect a more robust pipeline to show its face as we move forward and the cadence ought to improve relative to where it's been over the last few years. Obviously, we had some really important launches in 2010 but I think what you should expect from the company going forward is just the consistent cadence of highly relevant innovations to come out of the pipeline and be difference makers within the marketplace going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Did you quantify what the savings would be associated with some of the reorganization efforts that you will be implementing throughout 2011?", "James Crines", "We have. So we indicated, Joanne, in the release we're expecting to generate $100 million in savings on an annualized basis. And in 2011, just given the timing of these initiatives, expect that we'll realize $40 million to $50 million of those benefits in 2011. And that is reflected in our guidance.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "And your Trauma number was much better than we are expecting in this quarter. Is there anything in particular going on? Is that new products or market share shift?", "David Dvorak", "It's both, Joanne. I mean, we've been working at this for quite some time and have sort of hit a point now where enough of the Zimmer Natural Nails are launched, coupled with very competitive plate and screw offerings that we've developed over the last several years and some unique technologies in the periprosthetic plate category as well, all of that combined as leading to a lot of traction in the marketplace. So these are innovative products that are making a difference in the field. And one of the things that's most heartening about the Trauma performance is it was truly a global effort. We saw nice growth come out of all three of our geographic segments. But the principle door opener there are the new products again, the Natural Nail and the NCB Periprosthetic Plate System.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "My last question has to do with your personalized knee, could you just give us a little bit of color on how that launch is doing? You're one of the few manufacturers that has the right FDA labeling for that.", "David Dvorak", "Sure, Joanne. We're doing well with the launch. We continue to ramp up and every month we grow stronger and stronger in that category, getting good clinical results. And so this is a phase that we think is going to continue to expand and become increasingly important in the future. We're in a nice position with the technology that's launched and as you point out, properly cleared.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise of Leerink Swann.", "Richard Newitter", "This is Rich in for Rick. Just wanted to ask a question on Asia Pacific region in your Hips and Knees. I know that you have the reimbursement for Trabecular Metal in Japan. Hoping you could just provide some color around how significant that could be in 2011 in terms of incremental sales for that region? And also if you could talk about your Beijing ortho manufacturer acquisition, what kind of contribution should we expect this year from that? And how big can that get going forward?", "David Dvorak", "The approval that you referenced in Japan is a really important step because it validates the clinical import of Trabecular Metal technology. So we've been awarded a significant premium price position with the launch of Trabecular Metal. In this case, it's the Trabecular Metal Modular Cup System. So it'll improve our Hip performance within that market. It's going to create opportunities for us not only to improve mix but to take market share. Now of course you know how these launches work. This is a product that is just now beginning to launch and so it will take time for us to train sales representatives, to train surgeons and as the year progresses, we expect that to support our performance. Turning to your question on Montagne. This is an acquisition that in current terms is around a $10 million business. How big can that be? In the future, it's going to be a big, big market for us. It's a market that is currently about a $1 billion market that's going to double in the next three years. By virtue of this acquisition, we now have a leadership position in large joint reconstruction within that market but that market has a long ways to go in growth. So over the course of the next five, 10 years, it's going to become a very significant part of Zimmer's business. And so we're really happy to have the Montagne employee group join the Zimmer family and looking for big things out of that market going forward.", "Richard Newitter", "On Spine, you talked about eventually getting that to positive growth territory. Just can you update your time frame for when you think that can happen? Could it potentially happen as we exit the year?", "David Dvorak", "That's a 2011 goal of ours. There isn't any reason we shouldn't put that business on a track to get back in a positive space and market growth levels within this fiscal year. So that's reasonable, Rich.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Sung of Sanford Bernstein.", "Derrick Sung - Bernstein Research", "Just want to first clarify your view on sort of how you performed relative to the market this quarter. So with DePuy and Biomet posting weak sales and you and Stryker posting very strong sales, am I correct in that what you're saying is that, essentially the market from a revenue basis was stable this quarter versus Q3 and your outperformance was essentially revenue share gains versus the market? Is that a fair characterization?", "David Dvorak", "Yes, I think that the right way to think of that in a big picture context is, if the market improved in 10s of basis points, and our performance improvement as you can see was in the range of a few hundred basis points. And in the large category, you can look at 10-, 30-basis point improvement in market numbers dependent upon how you want to adjust the competitors that have already reported out results for billing days, et cetera. And we had a 300 basis point or so improvement in some of those big categories.", "Derrick Sung - Bernstein Research", "And how much of that revenue share gain is actually through procedure share versus the Metal-on-Metal guys seeing a mix shift down and you seeing a mix shift up from your Continuum Cup and new product launch?", "David Dvorak", "Yes, it's a mix of both. I mean, we're getting healthy mix out of the new product launches but I think we're also seeing procedure growth.", "Derrick Sung - Bernstein Research", "On your Knee business, this is a business that -- it looks almost over the last three years, you've sort of been consistently struggling growing below the market. When we look at the business on the surface, it doesn't look like there's any big product gaps that you're missing versus your competitors. You're out there with your Patient Specific knees, et cetera. Can you just give us some more color as to what's really the challenges that you're facing here? Is it a product gap issue that you can point to that you've just been missing a couple key products for the last couple years? Or is it an execution issue? Help us understand what's been going on there and you've mentioned that new products turn it around, but is that really the issue that you're facing?", "David Dvorak", "You had some competitors over the last three to five years have introduced new Knee systems and with those systems they provided updated instrumentation sets as well. And so to the extent that there was any gap that was the gap and that was a gap that we addressed last year and those posterior referencing instruments are rolling out now. They have been for the last half of the year or so. So we're starting to see some traction with those and beyond that it is an execution game for us. But we're in a good position. We have a very comprehensive product portfolio. We have the best Knee system in the world, the NexGen, as evidenced by the registry data and revision rates. So we're in a good position to get back to market growth, and we're going to bring the right level of focus on the commercial side to ensure that, that happens in 2011.", "Derrick Sung - Bernstein Research", "And just quickly on that, why is it that you would have an execution problem on the Knee side versus the Hip side where it's essentially the same sales force, et cetera?", "David Dvorak", "Well, you bring focus and priorities within those forces and those are both big categories. We have brought a lot of focus to getting the Knee business that was off market growth for a number of years, and it looks like it resolved that issue and so you should expect the same thing to come from us on the execution improvement side in Knees going forward, Derrick.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy of Jefferies & Company.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "I wondered if I could ask a little bit about the Spine business again. You guys wrote off a lot of the Abbott Spine deal if not all of it. Dynesys continues to struggle there. You announced a restructuring I guess of the management side of that. I'm curious now as you look out over the next couple of years what your broad strategies are there. Do you think you need to get larger in Spine to be relevant? Do you need some differentiated products in that? Just generally, how you think about that business over the next couple of years.", "David Dvorak", "Let me just first address correcting out that the write-off was not the Abbott Spine acquisition. That business continues to grow well for us. Combination of things led to us taking that impairment charge. But more importantly, going forward, we do think that we have the right leadership team in place. We've got a product cadence and pipeline that we're excited about for 2011 that we think is going to improve our position. This is a business that we're growing successfully OUS [outside the U.S. ] So we know we have the capability with the existing product portfolio. Some of the more unique technologies that we have within that portfolio benefit us outside the U.S. because of the regulatory barriers within the United States currently and the most profound example of that is the Dynesys System with what's happened in the last couple of years on the regulatory process within the United States. So we think we have the right pieces coming into place, a core product offering that's very competitive, a pipeline that is going to improve our position in that regard, a leadership team that's coming together and going to be a strong group I think that will drive future improvement to our performance. Beyond that, we do want to expand our critical mass in this space. So as we get those pieces together performing in an acceptable way, we'll be looking at opportunities to expand our footprint on Spine and pickup more technologies and expand our distribution footprints as well on a global basis.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "On the pricing commentary, I know you focused primarily on this notion of compression between the upper end of your pricing band and then the lower end. That upper band moving down. I'm curious about your confidence so that, that lower band doesn't deteriorate, that as hospitals and payers get more aggressive on that front that they start pushing on that end. What gives you that, again, that confidence that, that lower band is stable at this point?", "David Dvorak", "Well, fundamentally, that's not something that we're seeing and we think that the innovations are a big part of the answer to that. We're going to continue to improve the solutions that we provide and comprehensive solution is just beyond features and benefits of the products, and our strategy is to position us to where we don't see any downward pressure on that side of the pricing curve and we're confident that we're going to be able to execute our plans in a way where that doesn't come to fruition. So thanks, again, everyone for joining us today and for your continued interest in Zimmer. We look forward to speaking to you on our first quarter conference call at 8 a. m. on April 28, 2011. I'll now turn the call back to you, Christie.", "Operator", "Thank you again for participating in today's conference call.

I would like to turn the call over to Bob Marshall, Vice President Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Marshall, you may begin your call.", "Robert Marshall", "Good morning, and welcome to Zimmer's First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. I'm here with our President and CEO, David Dvorak; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Jim Crines.", "Before we start, I would like to remind you that statements made during this call that are not historical may be deemed forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties. ", "Also, the discussions during this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included  within the earnings release that was furnished in this morning's current report on Form 8-K. This information is also available on our website, www.zimmer.com, in the Investor Relations under Financial Information Reconciliation.", "With that, I'll now turn the call over to David Dvorak. David?", "David Dvorak", "Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call for the first quarter of 2011. This morning, I'll review our first quarter financial results, providing commentary on the year's progress-to-date and highlights from our performance. Jim will then provide additional financial details. As in previous quarters, I'll state all sales in constant-currency terms, and I'll discuss all earnings results on an adjusted basis, except as otherwise noted.", "Zimmer delivered solid sales results across all geographic segments and most businesses in the first quarter, resulting in improved margins and earnings. At the same time, operational improvements enabled us to accelerate our innovation strategy with a 10% increase in research and development investments in the quarter. Consolidated net sales for the quarter were $1.12 billion, an increase of 3.3%. And our earnings per share were $1.19, an increase of 16.7% over the prior-year period.", "Through the first quarter, we again experienced year-over-year sales growth in all of our geographic segments. Americas grew 2.0%; Europe, Middle East and Africa delivered what we believe to be market-leading growth of 4.2%; and Asia-Pacific again recorded impressive sales growth of 6.9%. These results were delivered against the backdrop of an unprecedented tragedy in Japan, one of our major markets. Zimmer is committed to supporting our colleagues and customers in Japan who continue to demonstrate tremendous resolve in navigating the impact of the recent disasters. ", "Turning to the results of our product categories.  Knee sales for the first quarter decreased year-over-year 1.0%, reflecting positive volume and mix of 0.7% and negative price of 1.7%. Outside the United States, our knee franchise delivered a stronger quarter compared with the prior-year period. On a global basis, the Zimmer unit compartmental High Flex Knee and NexGen Rotating Hinge products generated solid unit sales growth in the quarter. We also recently released several new products in Knees that leverage proprietary Zimmer technologies, including a range of Trabecular Metal augment shapes and cones, which significantly strengthen our offerings in the Knee Revision category and the NexGen LPS Mobile System that now features Longevity Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene. ", "Looking forward through 2011, we expect sales of these new products and increasing utilization of PSI [Patient Specific Instruments] and PRI [Posterior Referencing Instruments] instrument sets to contribute to elevated growth in Knees, supported by improved execution and easing comps in the second half of this year.", "We again delivered above-market growth in Hips in the first quarter, with a sales increase of 4.7%, reflecting positive volume and mix of 6.7% and negative price of 2.0%. Once again, the strong performance of our Hip business was supported by robust sales in the Americas, which delivered 5.0% growth, and significant improvement in the Asia-Pacific region, which generated sales growth of 10.2%. We continue to benefit from improved mix in our Hip business, supported by sales of recently launched innovative product lines, including the Continuum Acetabular Cup System. The performance of the Continuum System reinforces the value of products designed to provide customizable treatment solutions that enable surgeons to match their patients' lifestyle demands.", "Our Extremities business posted solid growth for the quarter with sales increasing by 10.7%. The value of our proprietary technology is evident in the performance of this business, where sales of our Trabecular Metal products continue to be noteworthy. The Trabecular Metal Reverse Shoulder System is now the #1 selling product in the reverse shoulder category. ", "Zimmer's Dental business continues to significantly outperform the market with first quarter sales of 20.8%. This impressive performance was broad-based and represents organic growth of 13.2%, as well as the contribution of our restructured RTI distribution arrangement. We're greatly encouraged by the continued strength of our Dental business, which maintains a broad and growing portfolio. In the first quarter, the newly released Tapered Screw-Vent Implant System with crestal options delivered healthy sales in the United States, and we're excited to launch this product in other global markets in the second quarter. We believe the overall Dental market is showing signs of recovery after a challenging period. ", "Trauma achieved above market sales growth in all geographic segments in the quarter, with sales increasing 13.5% over the prior-year period. Our performance was led by the Europe, Middle East and Africa segment with 19% growth for the quarter. We continue to benefit from increased sales of the NCB Periprosthetic Plating System for complex fractures, as well as the Zimmer Natural Nail product family, which has now surpassed 10,000 implantations since it was introduced. With an innovative and differentiated portfolio in Trauma and continued investments in our Trauma sales force, we're confident that we'll sustain our performance in the Trauma category. ", "Zimmer Spine reported a sales decrease of 5.8% in the quarter. Outside of the United States, Zimmer's Spines business demonstrated sales progress, but we continue to experience challenges in the U.S. market related to reimbursements and pricing. However, we're committed to developing an increasingly competitive product portfolio in Spine. In the first quarter alone, we released two innovative offerings with the PATHFINDER NXT percutaneous, MIS pedicle screw system and the TM-S Trabecular Metal Cervical Interbody Fusion Device.", "Zimmer\u2019s Surgical and Other business category delivered above-market sales growth of 7.3% over the prior-year period, again supported by strong sales of our bone cement, wound debridement and tourniquet products. ", "With regard to our acquisitions of Beijing Montagne Medical Device Company in China and SoPlus Surgical Power equipment in Switzerland, the integration of both of these businesses is proceeding well. In China, both Zimmer's legacy business and the Beijing Montagne franchise contributed significant growth in the first quarter.", "Turning now to the broader musculoskeletal market. Procedure volumes were stable relative to the fourth quarter but remained below what we would consider to be normal growth. As we review procedure trends in the U.S. market, we recognize that the economic recession resulted in declining enrollment in private health plans among people under the age of 65. As a consequence, a number of potential joint replacement patients have had to defer their treatment.", "Due to the extension of COBRA benefits, it appears that these deferrals did not significantly impact trends at a macro level until the second half of 2010. We don't believe that usage rates of total joints among the insured population have declined. Rather, the size of the uninsured population increased as employment rates climbed -- I\u2019m sorry, unemployment rates climbed. Therefore, in effect, the total patient pool declined. As we indicated in our prior call, we believe the growth rate of procedure volumes in the U.S. will begin to recover in the second half of 2011 as we exit out of the cyclical downturn associated with increased unemployment levels.", "With respect to pricing. We experienced price pressure of negative 0.9% in the first quarter, a stable trend from the previous quarter and in line with our expectations. We maintain our pricing outlook of negative 1% to 2% for the full year, understanding we'll anniversary out of negative pricing in Japan coming out of the first quarter. ", "As we discussed on our last call and as the performance of several of our franchises demonstrates, the market continues to reward clinically relevant and innovative product development with premium pricing and reimbursement. The above-market growth delivered by several of Zimmer's key businesses in the first quarter demonstrates the positive impact of product innovation supported by improved commercial execution. Many of Zimmer's recently introduced products and instrumentation systems reflect two of the core drivers of our innovation strategy. First, the development of customizable implant and instrumentation systems enable surgeons to deliver a personalized care experience to every patient, including options for all lifestyle demands. And second, the provision of clinically relevant products that deliver long-term value to patients, hospitals and healthcare systems.", "As we drive growth in our Reconstructive and Emerging businesses, we also continue to explore opportunities to expand the company's reach into early intervention products. For example, this quarter, our DeNovo NT natural tissue graft per cartilage repair enjoyed continued success, passing more than 2,000 cases to date. Also in the quarter, our partner, Seikagaku Corporation, received FDA approval for Gel-One, a single injection hyaluronic acid solution for pain relief that Zimmer plans to market in the United States. ", "By continuing to exercise disciplined financial management, the company will generate incremental funds to advance our product development programs and other strategic priorities. Over the last quarter, we made significant progress in our restructuring and transformation efforts with the completion of a management de-layering initiative that will accelerate speed, improve operational rigor and drive enhanced customer responsiveness. Other ongoing initiatives included consolidation of sourcing activities across all categories of spend and optimization efforts across our global manufacturing network.", "This includes the strategic sourcing of manufactured components where we can achieve the highest quality, lowest cost and optimal after-tax returns. All of these programs are designed to provide a source of funding for new innovation and clinical programs, as well as to create value through enhanced operating leverage. Beyond operational improvements, these programs also reflect our commitment to an even stronger performance-driven culture. Pursuing the attainment of world-class benchmarks across the company will accelerate growth and deliver increased value to shareholders through progressive, industry-leading operating margins and optimal deployment of capital.", "I'll now ask Jim to provide further details on the first quarter and our guidance. Jim?", "James Crines", "Thanks, David. I will review our first quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our 2011 guidance. Our total revenues for the first quarter were $1.116 billion, a 3.3% constant-currency increase compared with the first quarter of 2010. Net currency impact for the quarter was positive, increasing revenues by an additional 1.7% or $17.4 million. Favorable currency impact from our Japanese yen, Australia dollar, Swiss franc and Canadian dollar denominated revenues were partially offset by unfavorable currency impact from our euro-denominated revenues.", "For the quarter, our adjusted the gross profit margin was 75.4%. The margin ratio improved 50 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2010. The improvement in gross margin compared with prior year was a result of manufacturing efficiencies, which were partially offset by hedge losses and excess in obsolescence charges in the quarter.", "The company's R&D expense increased 10% on a reported basis when compared to the prior year. Our R&D expense remains at the low end of our targeted range of 5% to 6%, despite this increase. As David has discussed, product innovation is a key feature of our growth strategy, and we anticipate that R&D expense will continue to grow as we expand product development and clinical programs. ", "Selling, general and administrative expenses were $458 million in the first quarter, which was an increase of 2.5% on a reported basis. At 41.1% of sales, SG&A expenses were 100 basis points below prior year. For the quarter, reduced spending in general and administrative functions and lower product liability expense were offset by volume-related increases in selling and distribution costs and higher medical training and education expenses. ", "Special items amounted to $26 million in the quarter. These included costs and asset write-offs associated with our global restructuring and transformation initiatives. The majority of the cost incurred in the quarter related to severance, retention, acceleration of share-based compensation and other employee termination-related costs. Approximately 5% of our global workforce was impacted by our organizational change initiative, which involved a top-down de-layering of management but did not affect our direct labor or direct sales forces. The company also continues to incur integration cost from our recently completed acquisitions of Beijing Montagne Medical Device Company, SoPlus Power Equipment and third-party distributors in our Europe, Middle East and Africa segment. ", "Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased to $327 million, representing a profit-to-sales ratio of 29.3%. This ratio is 130 basis points higher than the prior-year first quarter, reflecting operational improvements in manufacturing and reduced general and administrative expenses. ", "Net interest expense for the quarter totaled $11 million compared to $14.6 million in the first quarter of 2010. This change is primarily due to having swapped a portion of our fixed-rate debt to floating rates. Adjusted net earnings were $231 million for the first quarter, an increase of 11.4% compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 16.7% to $1.19 on 193.8 million average outstanding diluted shares. These adjusted earnings per share are inclusive of approximately $0.05 of share-based compensation. At $1.08, reported diluted earnings per share increased 6.9% from the prior-year first quarter reported EPS of $1.01. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.9%, which is in line with our full year guidance and represents an increase of 10 basis points from the first quarter of 2010. ", "During the quarter, we repurchased 4.2 million shares at a total purchase price of $236 million. This represents almost 50% of our intended repurchasing plan for 2011, demonstrating our commitment to returning value to our shareholders.  As of March 31, 2011, approximately $970 million remained authorized under a $1.5 billion repurchase program, which expires at the end of 2013. The company had approximately 192 million shares of common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2011, down from 203 million as of March 31, 2010. ", "Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $182 million, down 30% from $260 million in the first quarter of 2010. The decrease in operating cash flow compared to the prior year was mainly due to a planned increase in accounts receivable of 6 days as we discontinued factoring in certain European markets. ", "Net receivables increased to $876 million from $767 million in 2010 or 14% over the prior-year period. In addition, inventories increased slightly in the first quarter of 2011. Adjusted inventory days on hand finished the quarter at 312 days, an increase of 5 days from year end 2010 and 10 days compared to the first quarter of 2010. The increase in inventory from prior-year end 2010 occurred in Hips, Dental and Surgical, all product categories that experienced above-market growth in the first quarter.", "Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter amounted to $86 million. Free cash flow in the first quarter was $119 million, $90 million lower than the first quarter of 2010. We define free cash flow as operating cash flow less cash outflows for instruments and property plant and equipments. This change in free cash flow was principally a result of the increase in accounts receivable combined with a small increase in inventories.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $63 million, including $46 million for instruments and $17 million for property plant and equipments. Cash outlays associated with investing activities during the quarter include $13 million for product distribution agreements and certain international distributor acquisitions. ", "I'd like to turn now to our guidance for 2011.  In our earnings release this morning, we announced that the company is reaffirming its full year sales and adjusted EPS guidance. We expect full year revenues to increase between 2% and 4% in constant currency when compared to 2010. We expect our Knee and Hip revenues will continue to be affected by slower market growth through the second quarter. We then look for market growth to improve in the second half against easing comps. Our guidance contemplates up to a 10% decrease in Japan's full year net sales in 2011 relative to our previous expectations due to the recent natural disasters. While it is difficult to predict the ongoing impact of these events, there may be temporary disruptions to elective hospital procedures caused by energy conservation measures.", "In the year ended December 31, 2010, the Japan market represented a little less than 10% of our consolidated net sales. Therefore, we estimate the negative impact to our net sales for the full year 2011 will be approximately 1% relative to our expectations before the natural disasters. ", "In contrast to this, we are now anticipating somewhat stronger global revenues in our Hips, Trauma, Dental and Surgical and Other product categories relative to our previous expectations. Assuming currency rates remain at current levels, we anticipate foreign currency translation will increase our reported 2011 revenues by an estimated 3%. Therefore, on a reported basis, our revenues are projected to be between 5% and 7% above 2010 results.", "We still expect our gross margin ratio for the full year to be approximately 75%. This takes into account approximately 90 basis points of anticipated losses on foreign currency hedges resulting from relative weakness in the U.S. dollar. In the second quarter, anticipated hedged losses, when compared with hedge gains from the prior-year second quarter, are expected to reduce gross margins by 160 basis points. Full year 2011 adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be in a range of $4.60 to $4.80. To arrive at GAAP earnings per share, you should subtract total charges for special items of $90 million to $100 million pretax or approximately $0.33 to $0.37 per share. Finally, please note that our guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or other unforeseen events. ", "David, I'll turn the call back over to you.", "David Dvorak", "Thanks, Jim. Zimmer's first quarter performance demonstrated continued progress toward our goal of consistently achieving growth at or above market rates in all of our geographies and businesses. We're committed to delivering value to our shareholders through disciplined execution of business transformation programs to generate strong cash flow for investment and strategic growth drivers and leverage in the P&L. ", "The musculoskeletal care market remains an exciting space that presents expansive opportunities for growth, both in established and emerging markets. We believe Zimmer is uniquely equipped to respond to the needs of all stakeholders in this market, combining the industry's most comprehensive and innovative product portfolio with robust clinical, health economic and commercial capabilities.", "And now I'd like to ask Brandi to begin the Q&A portion of our call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Adam Feinstein with Barclays Capital.", "Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital", "Just I guess there are a couple of things. And everything looks very strong, and I guess now that all of the companies have reported your numbers, you definitely look very strong on a relative basis. So just as you think about just market share gains and what may be going on there, just curious to get your thoughts. And then just at the same time, just in terms of just overall market growth, as you guys think about that in the back half of the year, just with the comps being slightly easy. Just curious what your updates views are there.", "David Dvorak", "Sure, Adam. We feel like we had a good quarter again overall and particularly strong with respect to our Hips, Trauma, Dental, Surgical categories, all of which we believe grew above market. Good performances as well coming out of the extremities division, not a global basis, probably more in line with market and that category and close the gap importantly on Knees relative to market growth rates. So I think that the work that we're doing there is showing some progress. I think that the market saw a bit more of a step down, particularly on the U.S. side of the Knee market. But we did close the gap, and so that's encouraging to us. And then finally, more work to do on the U.S. side of our Spine business. But we feel like we're taking some of the right steps to create a more robust product portfolio there and sure up our commercial execution as well. So the trends are all very positive. Coming into the year, we and many of you expected that the first half of the year comps were going to be more difficult than the second half of the year comps, and I think that's exactly what we're seeing in the marketplace today. So we'd be optimistic that the second half of the year, with the easing comps, would show some progress in the overall market as well.", "Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital", "Okay. And would you think that the Knees can grow in the second half of the year? Or is the thought process that they will be stable?", "David Dvorak", "The Knee market?", "Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital", "Yes.", "David Dvorak", "Yes, we do believe that the Knee market will grow in the second half of the year. I think that what you're seeing in the U.S. side is really a consequence of what I was describing earlier, where the uninsured population base is getting access to these procedures as -- well, the uninsured population base that would like to get access to these procedures has grown because of the rising unemployment levels. And we start to anniversary out a bit of that on the market side, I think, as we enter the second half of the year. So we'd be optimistic that those comps would produce more favorable results across the market.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.", "David Lewis - Morgan Stanley", "Jim, quick question on guidance. Just thinking about EPS guidance and the strength in the quarter, and I appreciate the Japan issues, which you're trying to estimate in the back half of the year. But just considering the strength we're seeing in cost containment issues, product cadence that David mentioned, as well as also the comparables, is it safe to say you're now more comfortable with the upper half of EPS guidance range for the year?", "James Crines", "I think it's safe to say that we're very comfortable with the guidance range that we\u2019ve provided for the full year. I think one of the things you have to keep in mind is not only the issue associated with Japan and the effect that's likely to have over the next 3 quarters, more pronounced than what we saw in the first quarter, just given the timing of those events. Is the fact that we do have -- as we pointed out on our last call and I've highlighted as well on this call, we do have some headwind that we're dealing with on the gross margin line related to the currency hedging program.", "David Lewis - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, very helpful. And then, David, in this call, we heard a lot about Asia-Pac clearly accelerating across multiple product lines. I wonder if you could help us sort of understand, we obviously have the Japan impact, whether that is the impact you really see in the market today, whether that's sort of the best estimate you can give in terms of what the market impact could be. And then considering what -- maybe you could tell us what Beijing Montagne is actually doing for the company. So I'm just trying to understand given the significant acceleration you're continuing to see in that business plus the acquisition and with the Japan pressure, how do you see the growth rates in Asia-Pac trending in the back half of the year, considering you're going to begin to anniversary some of the price cuts in Japan?", "David Dvorak", "That's true. I mean, those price cuts anniversary out as we speak here this month. And so that eliminates a headwind that we've been facing for some time. We just believe that we're doing a good job in executing. We had a good year last year in Asia-Pacific as well. So we're launching the right products in the right places and doing a nice job with those launches. And those product launches make a difference. So pardon me, our medical training education is really at full speed. That really enhances your opportunity to effectively launch of those products, and we have a stable team of experienced people leading our efforts in Asia-Pacific. And I would tell you that the same thing, I believe, is occurring in Europe, Middle East and Africa. We're seeing nice progress in those markets. Some of the disruptive factors that we faced over the last several years are now being washed out, and I think we're just regaining our momentum in the OUS markets in general.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.", "Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Just a couple of clarifications. You called out the impact of your acquisition in China. Did that have any material stocking benefit to the quarter?", "David Dvorak", "No stocking benefit. And those revenues are not all that significant in the context of the business either, Mike. That was a business that was round numbers, a $10 million business or so at the point of acquisition.", "Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. And then, David, I just want to maybe take a step back here. If we just rewound 6 months, you had a soft third quarter, you grew about 200 basis points below the Recon market, and here we are 6 months later, the Recon market is a little bit softer but you grew about 200 basis points better than the market. And it would be your kind of your first real standout quarter relative to the market in really quite a long time. So I just want to get a little bit more perspective on the delta in the company's performance over that 6-month period of time and what you see is driving that?", "David Dvorak", "Yes, a number of factors, Mike, and these are all areas that we've been very focused in our efforts on for some time, and you're familiar with those efforts, I think, to a great degree. But we're launching the right products. We're launching those products effectively. We're regaining our momentum within the commercial side of our organization. And then, we just have a lot of things that are coming together and heading in the right direction. The key for us is to continue to develop momentum in these areas and to sustain that effort with new products. And we believe that we're building out the right product pipeline to achieve just that.", "Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then just I'm going to push a little bit more on the guidance question. So even with the outperformance this quarter, at least relative to Street expectations on the top and bottom line, the current guidance for the year is still the appropriate guidance range? There's no reason to narrow that range today?", "James Crines", "Mike, this is Jim. As we indicated on our last call, described our expectations with respect to the overall market, talked about the softness across the overall market, we anticipated to see in the first half. We also indicated that our guidance for the full year was predicated on stable employment. So just as we said on the last call, to the extent that we see the economy improvement, perhaps unemployment levels coming down, we would expect to see more robust growth in the second half and effectively to hit better results relative to the range that we provided at this point. To the extent that we see less disruption than what we have contemplated in Japan in elective procedures, that as well could lead to stronger results relative to the range that we've provided at this point. But we're one quarter into the year, and we just feel it's appropriate to maintain that guidance and the range that we've provided at this point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.", "Robert Hopkins", "First one for David and then for Jim. First, on the Knee market, especially in the U.S., now that everybody but Smith [ph] and Nephews [ph] reported, we can see that the Knee market stepped down in the first quarter. Everyone's reporting negative growth just about. I was wondering, is there anything that you're seeing in the second half besides easier comps that would lead you to a conclusion that things will get better from here? Are there any leading indicators, tangible evidence that you're seeing right now that would give you confidence that we're going to see an increase? Or is it really just mostly easier comps?", "David Dvorak", "Well I think that -- let's talk a little bit more about the easing-of-the-comp side of it. If we go back to the root cause for what caused the drop-off in the second half of the year, we really do believe that it was the sub-65-year-old category of patients with expanding unemployment rates and those people dropping out of private insurance pools with declining enrollments that caused that decline, Bob. And so I think that COBRA probably -- the extension efforts masked some of that effect for some time, but it really found traction in the second half of last year. And so the comps are just the companies' weaker performances across the market. But I think that if you look at the population base, you're going to be growing off of, albeit a reduced base in the second half of the year. And as Jim said, if the economy gets a bit healthier, if employment expands these opportunities and enrollment, as a consequence, expands, then it could be something more than just a positive comparison off of an easier comp.", "Robert Hopkins", "Okay. But are you seeing anything in terms of backlogs increasing or anecdotal feedback from surgeons at this point that suggests we may see an uptick?", "David Dvorak", "Our comments are not so much based on leading indicators along those lines, Bob.", "Robert Hopkins", "Okay. Thank you. And then for Jim, two quick things. One on the SG&A front. When should we see the full benefit of the restructuring and did we see that full benefit in the first quarter? And then secondly, from the perspective of Dental, obviously, you had a very good quarter. Does that make it less likely that you'd seek external options to increase critical mass at this point?", "James Crines", "So with respect to the first question, we saw modest benefits from the restructuring and transformation initiatives. David indicated that one of the major initiatives, if you will, the de-layering of the management, was completed in the first quarter but largely completed towards the end of the first quarter. So again, modest benefit reflected in the numbers at this stage. We're still projecting to realize in the order of $40 million to $50 million of savings in 2011. But again, we have -- as we've indicated, we do intend to reinvest some of those savings in product development, clinical programs and as we did in this quarter, in medical education and training as well. So there's more value to come, if you will, as we get further down the road in completing the balance of those programs. And it is the case, as you pointed out with respect to the Dental business that we're very pleased with the, obviously, the performance of that business. We feel we have a very strong management team in place. We continue to provide support in terms of investments in the product development programs at our Dental business, investment in license arrangements that have enabled that business, as you know, to gain ownership of the customer relationships with respect to the biologic softening within that franchise, other license arrangements that have enabled us to expand that portfolio. And we do believe that we're well-positioned with those kind of investments to continue to create value with that business. And don't feel that it's necessary per se -- not that we wouldn't be interested in opportunities to have an even bigger position within that market, because we like that market, but don't feel that it's necessary for us to get bigger through acquisitions to be able to create value.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "I was hoping you could come back and talk a little bit about the pricing environment. If I look across both Hips and Knees, it actually looks like things got a tad better from the fourth quarter. I think in the fourth quarter on Knees, you had quoted negative price of 2.3% and the first quarter, you said 1.7%. And then on the Hips side, I think it was 2% in the fourth quarter and 2% in the first quarter as well. Could you maybe just give us a little bit more perspective on what's happening on the pricing dynamic? I think that was sort of a key theme that came out of AOS [ph] but it looks like things there just remain very status quo.", "David Dvorak", "I think that's a fair way to characterize it, David. I don't know that the variation from last quarter to this quarter really indicates any fundamental shift in some of the pressure that we've been experienced and the effect that, that's having. And the way that it shows up in negative price in the order of 1% to 2% across the various product franchises. A bit more pronounced, as you indicated, Hips and Knees. We talked on the last call about this price compression, particularly within the U.S. market. We continue to see that, as we expected to, coming into the year, and that is something that is going to carry on through the balance of 2011, at least within the U.S., and then of course, we've got an easing comp with respect to Asia-Pacific and the fact that we anniversary out of the Japan price cuts going into the second quarter.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And maybe just to follow up on Bob's last question regarding Dental. I mean in general, if you look across your portfolio, clearly, you are the #1 player in reconstructive implants and that scale is having a benefit combined with some of the new products that you've launched. If you look across some of your other businesses where you are relatively subscale from a market share perspective, while the growth rates this quarter were very strong, can you maybe talk about some of the initiatives you might undertake to increase your scale? And also maybe comment on to what extent you think scale matters in some of those segments and maybe in light of also the announced transaction yesterday.", "David Dvorak", "Sure. I think that we've been consistent in describing our business development strategy for some time. As far as the categories go, nothing has changed there. The musculoskeletal market is the space that we operate in. It's the place where we think we can create the most value for our shareholders and other stakeholders. So this is where we're going to live, and we think we're uniquely positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in all of these markets that we serve. You're right to point out that scale matters. I don't think that scale necessarily translates into meaning that you have to be #1 or #2 in those categories to create value for the shareholders and other stakeholders. But you certainly have to have enough critical mass to where you can justify investing in product development, for example, and feel that you have the distribution channel to be able to create value through those investments. And so those are places that we continue to emphasize the growth of the smaller businesses. Those emerging businesses are all in single-digit market shares at this point in time. But our position is that if we do the right things, we think that we can grow above market and take market share. If we find external development opportunities that allow us to accelerate progress in those categories, we would pursue those. But we wouldn't do it at the cost of an overly dilutive transaction, and we wouldn't do it if we didn't think that we weren't going to create shareholder value in a reasonable time period. So the hurdle rates are fairly rigorous, and we're always analyzing what other opportunities that we have to redeploy that cash. So it's going to be a consistent balance for us, going forward, of both internal and external development. But we're not going to be so adamant about becoming the #1 player in one of those subcategories that we would go off and do something that's adverse to the shareholders' interest.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. And then Jim, just want to clarify, the second quarter gross margin, you said, was that down 160 basis points. That's on a year-over-year basis?", "James Crines", "That's correct.", "Operator", "You're next question comes from the line of Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "You've clearly sort of presented a view on reacceleration, at least in growth rate in the U.S. off of comps. I was wondering if you could provide some color in your core reconstruction market as to how you see your European growth rates playing out in the back half of the year. Are you expecting to see a similar sort of reacceleration there? And maybe just some color on how austerity and pricing is playing out there in Europe.", "David Dvorak", "I would describe the European market as being one that, at least in our view, seems to be stabilizing. I think that our own execution is accelerating. And I think that we would expect to perform quite well relative to the market for the balance of this year. We believe that we were leading the industry in growth from whatever numbers we can gain access to in the first quarter, and we're optimistic about that group's ability to perform. And for the balance of the year, we have strong management, great products.  We're executing launches of new products quite nicely in that space, and we know what areas we have further work to do. But many of the large markets are performing at a high level at this point in time. And I would tell you that I think that we just see a stabilization in that core market with respect to those austerity measures. So whereas in the U.S., some of the pressure would manifest itself in price, some of the pressure in the past in Europe did manifest itself in procedures. But as we said all along, we view, in any of these markets, the decline in those procedure rates to be deferments as opposed to people that are going to be able to just forego the procedures. And I think that what you're starting to see in the stabilization of Europe is just that, that these patients don't go away, that even with the austerity measures that may have suppressed procedure rates in past periods, that ultimately, those health care systems have to address the needs of the patients. And so I would see a positive outlook within that market and, certainly, as it pertains to Zimmer in particular.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Great. Thank you. That's helpful. And I guess maybe a question on Spine. And I appreciate that you're kind of a small player here. But one of your competitors yesterday presented a view that they thought the Spine market, while sort of growing around 2% right now, might eventually sort of reestablish itself at kind of a mid-single growth rate. Would you share that view? And kind of what are your views of the Spine market moving forward?", "David Dvorak", "I think that, that's probably as good of a view as exists right now, projecting forward within that market. I think that there will continue to be some price pressure within the market. But it's a big market. It will continue to be a very interesting market, and I would say that our performance right now, as it pertains to U.S. as opposed to the OUS Spine market, is really more Zimmer-specific issues that we're well on our way towards addressing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Leerink Swann.", "Frederick Wise - Leerink Swann LLC", "Let me turn back to the Hip market, and perhaps, you could give us a little more perspective on U.S. Hips. The Metal-on-Metal, as part of the market, shrinking. I'd be curious to know where you think it is and where it's going. And I assume that, that's helpful for Zimmer as you roll out the new products. But specifically on the new products, is this helping you increase share volume mix at existing accounts? Or in the context of the Metal-on-Metal issues, helping you get back into accounts, older accounts, opening new accounts?", "David Dvorak", "Sure, Rick. I think that the U.S. Hip market was fairly consistent from what we can tell sequentially from Q4 to Q1 of this year. The overall global market, we think, was quite consistent from Q4 to Q1. So our step-up in performance is really again driven by the new products and the enhanced execution on the commercial side. With respect to the Metal-on-Metal market, we were never a large player in that subset of the market. And I think that the views of, kind of the collective views of the analysts are accurate, that, that was probably a market that was round numbers. 25% of the market is measured by units and maybe 30% or so of the market is measured by dollars. That has declined fairly dramatically. If you had to peg a number now, I would say that the estimates of around 10% or 10% or 15% are probably directionally correct. And I would tell you that as it pertains to Zimmer, we're sub-5% in penetration or as it represents a percentage of our sales on the Hips side. So it isn't a risk for us going forward, and it is very much an opportunity for us, not only because we don't have that headwind in the performance of our Hip business, but the solutions that we've been launching are very timely, very responsive to what surgeons and patients are seeking. And that's why we're seeing the great uptick of the Continuum Cup of our broad portfolio of stems. And we would anticipate that we're going to continue to make progress in that market. So it's a combination of potentially getting some business back that may have been lost historically to other companies for Metal-on-Metal users, as well as penetrating new accounts. And I would tell you as well, we're getting some mix benefit of the Hip side, and that's consistent with our view that if one innovates in the right way within this space, in the current climate, you can still get mix opportunities. So it's a combination of all those drivers.", "Frederick Wise - Leerink Swann LLC", "Right. Thank you. I want to follow up on the gross margin question and answer. I think we all heard you talk about the 160 basis points of hedge loss. But in this quarter, manufacturing efficiencies helped -- and you also had an obsolescent charge, I don't know how to -- the right way to ask you for the second quarter, but I assume those obsolescent charges won't be there and you'll get more manufacturing efficiencies? I mean, we shouldn't take the 75.4% minus 160 basis points, I assume, Jim and say 73.8% for the second quarter. I assume it's not that simple?", "James Crines", "Yes, that's right, Rick. And I think the question was asked earlier as to how to think about that 160 basis points. It is relative to prior-year second quarter. So that's really off of the prior-year second quarter that you would need to take that into account. And I think you do, Rick, you're sort of touching on something that may not as evident to people, and that is that we are experiencing stronger, if you will, operational efficiencies than we had anticipated coming into the year. So what puts us in the position to hold the margin guidance at 75% in spite of having an additional 2 points of currency lift on the top line, which I think as people understand, always results in us having more significant hedge losses in an environment where the dollar is weak. Those operational efficiencies are what is allowing us to offset the additional hedge losses over the course of the year and still hold to the guidance of 75% for the full year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG", "I just wanted to go back again, I guess, to -- you'd touched a little bit about it, but yesterday [indiscernible] and J&J, and just kind of your thoughts more broadly on the longer term and just kind of the need that you may have to bundle across, not only, obviously, the Knee business but not having a substantial Trauma or Spine. How do you think that's going to affect you both near and long term? I would imagine near term, maybe some disruption? I don't know if you would agree with that, but any comments there would be helpful.", "David Dvorak", "Sure, Kristen. These are strong competitors and great franchises on both sides that are involved in that transaction. So they will continue to be strong competitors if that deal is consummated and notwithstanding any disruption, which always exists in the integrations of companies. I think that there is always opportunity over the course of the disruptions during those integrations, but they'll emerge as strong competitors on both sides. The point that we're focused on is ensuring that we can compete effectively in the marketplace, and we're doing the right things to ensure that we have very competitive offerings in these categories. And I think that being strong in all the subsets of the musculoskeletal care market is going to be very important to us going forward. But it's an area that we've been focused on and vigilant about over the course of the last many years. And we're starting to see some of the benefits of that focus and our commitment. Our Trauma performance is a good example right now of what we intend to do. So notwithstanding that transaction, we believe that we're going to be in a share-gain position within those franchises, and we're making all the important moves that we need to make in investments to ensure that, that is the outcome.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG", "And do you believe that just specifically within Spine and Trauma that you can build those distances to some sort of critical mass in some reasonable timeframe to be competitive or do you anticipate the need to have to go out and look for external opportunities?", "James Crines", "I believe it's going to be a combination of the 2. I think that the opportunities that we have in those 2 different franchises are a bit different. And what it's going to take to exploit those opportunities is a bit different. But pull it together, and it's got going to be a combination of both internal and external development.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG", "And then just a quick clarification on Dental. In the quarter, it was also driven by 10% price increases. So it looks like the unit growth wasn't quite as robust as the reported number would suggest. Anything unusual about that 10%? Does that just reflect -- I know you said there was some distributor buy-in, I'm not sure if that's inflating that price or if you really are getting 10% price in Dental. And just kind of more broadly on the distribution kind of buy-ins. Is this something that we should continue to expect to see? It seems like it's more internationally based at this point than any decision that you guys are making in terms of rethinking the structure of the U.S. distribution network to go more direct?", "David Dvorak", "With respect to the first question, it is driven by -- the pricing on the Dental side is enhanced by the RTI restructuring. And so we are describing that our performance, round numbers, is about 700 basis points or so improved by virtue of that restructuring that took place going into the fourth quarter of last year. So that's what you're seeing there, Kristen. And want to pick up on the second, Jim?", "James Crines", "So as far as the strategy with respect to the OUS markets, that is an area where we can invest more aggressively to establish critical mass within that franchise. So we've done distributor acquisitions in the past to support that strategy, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to do that going forward.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG", "And just regarding the U.S. more broadly just, kind of recon distribution network independent distributors. Any rethinking of that given kind of the changing market dynamics?", "James Crines", "Those strategies that we're currently executing too, Kristen, are OUS strategies.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Matson with Mizuho Securities.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.", "I guess just had a question on the Gel-One product. First of all, how are you going to be selling that product? Is it going to be sold through your Hip and Knees sales force? And secondly, what's the potential opportunity for that product in terms of revenue? And was any of that factored into your guidance for this year?", "David Dvorak", "It will not affect our performance in any material way this year just because of the timing of the launch. But to answer your question, generally, we're going to be leveraging our existing distribution channel and relationships in the sale of that product. It's a large market. We estimate that the market is, round numbers, $700 million, and there are a couple of large competitors in particular. But this Gel-One product is one of only 2 single-injection products that will be on the market. And so we feel like through the channel and the relationships that we have that this is a great fit and an opportunity that we're going to take advantage of going forward.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.", "Okay. And then I just have a second question on a comment earlier in the call about strategic sourcing of manufacturing. Does that imply that you're looking at potentially setting up or sourcing manufacturing from some lower-cost regions? I know most of your competitors have facilities in Asia, particularly in China. You're probably the exception to that. So just wondering if that's a sign that you're evaluating going into some lower-cost regions.", "David Dvorak", "We really are focused on leveraging our existing manufacturing footprint. We have excellent people within these manufacturing operations across the globe. Obviously, the largest one is located here in Warsaw, and that will be our principal manufacturing facility for the foreseeable future. So the efforts are really to optimize our existing operations. With respect to the emerging markets, we could see production being leveraged out of the Montagne facilities and expanding, but that's likely to be production that would serve those same emerging markets as opposed to displacing any manufacturing on a domestic basis.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.", "Okay. And then just given that 2 of your competitors now have these dual mobility hips, is that a product category that Zimmer would consider entering, especially given the issues with the Metal-on-Metal hips?", "David Dvorak", "We have very robust pipeline in development. So we're always exploring opportunities to address unmet clinical needs. And I won't respond to the direct question, but if we believe that there's a clinical benefit and a need within the marketplace, you can bet that it would be something that we would be exploring and potentially developing within our pipeline.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "I know you talked a little about the Beijing Montagne acquisition. I know it's still relatively small. But what are your thoughts around the opportunity there? I mean, where do you think that business can go for you over the course of this year and into next year?", "David Dvorak", "It's an important market for us going forward. But I wouldn't measure it in terms of what it can do for us in the next year or 2. I think these emerging strategies are going to be critical to the company's success in the longer term. So the growth percentages are likely to be high. And to date, we're doing a good job. We have excellent leadership in that market. And I think that the acquisition is going to be a very good fit for us. But I wouldn't focus on material numbers coming out of those markets relative to the consolidated numbers that we produced as an overall business in that timeframe, Raj.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay. And then just lastly, on the Knee side. You and several other competitors, mostly everybody now except, I think, Stryker, have this custom knee-cutting guides. Perhaps you could give us some indication of how that's tracking or what percentage of Knees are now using those and what you think the opportunity is longer term for those as well.", "David Dvorak", "Yes. We think it's an important technology. But I would tell you that the penetration rate at this point in time is relatively low. It's growing at impressive rates. And I suspect that, that's the case across the market for those technologies. But I would see that as being a first-generation technology. And I think that you're going to see enhancements within the marketplace to those types of technologies that can lead to more customized solutions for patients and ensure excellent implant placements and great wear as a consequence of that for these implants going forward. So I think it's an area that you're going to see the market continue to focus on, and we intend to be a leader within that space.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "And are you able to get good ASP bump for those? O are they included with the knee implant? Or how do you realize some revenue from those?", "David Dvorak", "We have been realizing revenue from those. I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today and for your continued interest in and support for Zimmer. We look forward to speaking you on our second quarter conference call at 8 a.m. on July 27. I'll now turn the call back to you, Brandi.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference.

Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Operator", "Good morning, and welcome to Zimmer's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. I'm here with our CEO, David Dvorak; and our CFO, Jim Crines. Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties. ", "Also, the discussions during this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included within the earnings release, which is available on our website at investor.zimmer.com. With that, I'll now turn the call over to David Dvorak. David?", "David C. Dvorak", "Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call for the first quarter of 2012. This morning, I'll review our first quarter financial results, providing commentary on the year's progress to date and highlights from our performance. Jim will then provide additional financial details. I'll state all sales in constant currency terms, and I'll discuss all earnings results on an adjusted basis except as otherwise noted. ", "Zimmer delivered increased top line sales from the first quarter, highlighted by solid sales execution in our Europe, Middle East and Africa and Asia-Pacific segments. Zimmer's first quarter performance was in line with our expectations, setting the foundation for accelerated growth in the second half of 2012. We continue to be confident on the promise of a robust, new product pipeline across Zimmer's portfolio. Progress on our transformation programs is enabling us to make the strategic investments necessary to fully exploit the opportunities presented by these new products while at the same time meeting our financial commitments. ", "Consolidated net sales for the quarter were $1.14 billion, an increase of 2.7%, and our earnings per share were $1.30, an increase of 9.2% over the prior year period. In the first quarter, all of our geographic segments delivered year-over-year sales growth. Americas grew 0.8%; Europe, Middle East and Africa experienced growth of 4.2%; and Asia-Pacific recorded sales growth of 6.5%. Once again, we also recorded attractive growth in key emerging markets around the world. ", "Turning now to the results of our product categories. Knee sales for the first quarter increased year-over-year 2.4%, reflecting positive volume and mix of 4.9% and negative price of 2.5%. This performance was supported by improved sales growth globally, including an impressive 4.7% in Europe, Middle East and Africa and 6.9% in Asia-Pacific. Importantly, we generated more than 400 basis points of sequential improvement in the growth of our knee business in the United States relative to the fourth quarter of 2011. ", "Throughout 2012, Zimmer will begin introducing significant implant and instrument additions to the Knee portfolio. For example, on the first quarter, we introduced Patient Specific Instruments for the Zimmer unit compartmental High Flex Knee. This innovative system, as well as a number of other offerings to be introduced in the coming quarters, reinforces Zimmer's position in the exciting intelligent instrumentation segment. These streamlined disposable instrumentation systems are clinically relevant, cost effective and highly marketable. We believe they represent the next generation of orthopedic technologies, surpassing current navigation and robotic systems. ", "And finally, building on the long-term, market-leading success of our NexGen and Natural-Knee systems, at the end of the first quarter, we received FDA clearance for the first phase of our Next Generation Knee System. We're extremely excited to introduce this new system to markets globally over the next several years. As is typically the case with a technology of this magnitude, it will be available on a limited basis through most of 2012 in anticipation of a broad commercial launch thereafter. ", "Zimmer's hip business delivered sales growth of 2.5% in the quarter, reflecting positive volume and mix of 4.8% and negative price of 2.3%. These results were supported by the Europe, Middle East and Africa region with sales growth of 3.2% and the Asia-Pacific region with 7.6% sales growth. We continue to generate positive mix on our hip business, supported by strong sales of our innovative personalized product lines. For example, the Continuum Acetabular Cup construct continues to grow at attractive rates and offers opportunities for competitive selling. Expanding on our clinically successful buried surface options in the hip category, we also received clearance in Europe for VIVACIT-E, our new Vitamin E highly cross-linked polyethylene. ", "Zimmer's Extremities business recorded sales growth of 4.8% in the quarter. Our Trabecular Metal Shoulder products again generated attractive sales. As we move through 2012, we're excited by the potential of upcoming new products across a range of anatomical sites in this business, including the lower extremities. ", "Zimmer's Dental business recorded a sales decrease of 2.3% in the quarter. While we faced market softness outside the U.S., we anticipate improved performance in the second half of 2012 based on the expected impact of a number of recently introduced innovative products in this business, including products and new segments for the company. Notably, we introduced the Trabecular Metal Dental Implant in the United States market at the end of the quarter, and we began to introduce the Zfx CAD/CAM digital dentistry system in some European markets. ", "Sales in our Trauma business increased 7.7% in the quarter despite the impact of an unusually warm winter in the United States. Our international segments again delivered impressive performances, with Europe, Middle East and Africa reporting 17.5% sales growth and Asia-Pacific recording 14.4% sales growth. We've established a robust portfolio in Zimmer's Trauma business, including innovative offerings in all 3 major segments of the trauma market: Plates and screws, intramedullary nailing systems and external fixation. We're particularly excited by the XtraFix External Fixation System, which is now broadly available in the United States. ", "Zimmer's Spine reported a sales decrease of 6.0% in the quarter. This market continues to face challenges related to the pricing pressure and payor approvals. Zimmer managed to partially offset these challenges to increase sales of recently introduced products, including the PathFinder NXT percutaneous MIS pedicle screw system, the TM-S Trabecular Metal Cervical Interbody Fusion Device and the inViZia Anterior Cervical Plate System. ", "Zimmer's surgical and other business category again delivered strong sales growth of 9.2% over the prior year period. These results were supported by increased sales of our bone cement, wound debridement, power equipment and biologic products. Zimmer's Universal Power Equipment System, as well as the STABLECUT line of blades, are now more broadly available. We anticipate these new platforms will contribute to further growth in this category beginning in the second half of this year. ", "In the first quarter, our Biologics group introduced the Chondrofix Osteochondral Allograft, a product designed to address osteochondral lesions in a single-stage procedure. We continue to generate strong growth from our biological joint preservation and restoration offerings, which represent key components of our portfolio of personalized solutions across the continuum of care. ", "Turning now to the broader musculoskeletal market. Overall, procedure volumes in the quarter were stable relative to the fourth quarter of 2011, consistent with our projections coming into the year. We're cautiously optimistic that this quarter's uptick in the United States knee market represents the beginnings of an improved environment, but we're not assuming that this single data point is a trend just yet. ", "With respect to pricing, we experienced price pressure of negative 2.0% in the first quarter. This reflects some slightly increased pressure on our reconstructive and spine product categories in line with our expectations. The biannual price decrease in Japan, which went into effect on April 1, was greater than we had anticipated coming into the year. While this price change is not insignificant to our Japan business, it adds only modest headwind to our full year pricing outlook. We're fully confident in our ability to offset this pressure with positive revenue contributions from other sources. ", "Before I turn the call over to Jim, I'd like to reiterate several points regarding our strategic priorities. The positive contribution of product innovation to our performance was reinforced by another quarter of at or above market sales growth in many of our geographic segments and product categories. Zimmer's pipeline of clinically relevant and differentiated technologies has never been more robust or more exciting, and new implant and instrumentation offerings continue to generate attractive sales. The success of our R&D program is driven by increased investments as well as organizational changes we have made to better align these functions. Complementing our R&D efforts, we continue to pursue prudent bolt-on external development opportunities within the musculoskeletal space. ", "As previously discussed, our M&A strategy targets opportunities that can deliver meaningful returns in a reasonable time frame. All these activities are made possible as a result of the savings generated from our transformation programs and our ongoing disciplined financial management. We remain vigilant in executing our transformation journey, which will enable us to deliver financial leverage in 2012 and beyond. ", "I'll now ask Jim to provide further details on the first quarter and our guidance. Jim?", "James T. Crines", "Thanks, David. I will review our first quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional performance related to our 2012 sales and earnings guidance. Our total revenues for the first quarter were $1,141,000,000 or 2.7% constant currency increase compared with the first quarter of 2011. Net currency impact for the quarter decreased revenues by 0.4% or $4.7 million. Unfavorable currency impact from our euro-denominated revenues was partially offset by favorable currency impact from our Japanese yen and Australian dollar-denominated revenues. ", "For the quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 74.8%. The margin ratio declined 60 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2011. The decline in gross margin compared with prior year was a result of negative pricing and higher unit costs associated with lower volumes, which were partially offset by lower excess in obsolescence charges and royalties in the quarter. ", "The company's R&D expense increased 7% on a reported basis when compared to the prior year, including higher spending on new platform development projects across all product franchises, including our Next Generation Knee System that David referenced in his remarks. We remain confident that steps taken to better align our R&D support functions with our product category leaders will continue to drive a faster pace of product innovation, which is a key feature of our growth strategy. ", "Selling, general and administrative expenses were $463 million in the first quarter, which was an increase of 1.1% on a reported basis. At 40.6% of sales, SG&A expenses were 50 basis points below prior year. For the quarter, expense reductions from our transformation programs drove favorability as a percentage of sales. Savings from those programs were partially offset by increased G&A expenses related to legal matters and recruiting and relocation of new personnel. Special items in the quarter amounted to $34 million. These include the project expenses and contract terminations associated with our global restructuring and transformation initiatives and certain dispute resolution-related charges. Also included our integration costs related to the Beijing Montagne, SoPlus, Synvasive and ExtraOrtho acquisitions. ", "Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased to $330 million, representing a profit-to-sales ratio of 28.9%. This ratio was 40 basis points lower than the prior year first quarter, reflecting gross margin pressure and higher R&D cost, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses. Net interest expense for the quarter totaled $14 million compared to $11 million in the first quarter of 2011. This increase resulted from the addition of $550 million of senior unsecured notes in the third quarter of 2011. ", "Adjusted net earnings were $231 million for the first quarter, an increase of 0.2% compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9.2% to $1.30 on a 178.5 million average outstanding diluted shares. These adjusted earnings per share inclusive of approximately $0.05 of share-based compensation. At $1.17, reported diluted earnings per share increased 8.3% from the prior year first quarter reported EPS of $1.08. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.9%, which is in line with our expectations and comparable with the first quarter of 2011. ", "During the quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares at a total purchase price of $142 million. As of March 31, 2012, approximately $1.36 billion remain authorized under a $1.5 billion repurchase program, which expires at the end of 2014. The company had approximately 177 million shares of common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2012, down from 193 million as of March 31, 2011. Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $207 million, an increase of 14% from $182 million in the first quarter of 2011. The increase in operating cash flow compared to the prior year was primarily due to the timing of income tax payments and year-to-year improvement in working capital. Adjusted inventory days on hand finished the quarter at 293 days, a decrease of 20 days compared with the prior year period. ", "Net receivables increased to $895 million from $876.3 million in 2011 or 2.1% over the prior year period. This resulted in a 4-day increase in day sales outstanding. The increase in day sales outstanding is largely due to a more diversified geographic mix of sales, as well as increases in certain Southern European hospital accounts. We continue to monitor the financial crisis in the eurozone and the indirect credit exposure we have to those governments through their public hospitals. We remain confident in our ability to continue to manage our working capital in an efficient and effective manner. ", "Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter amounted to $97 million. Free cash flow in the first quarter was $159 million, $40 million higher than the first quarter of 2011. We define free cash flow as operating cash flow less cash outflows for instruments and property, plant and equipment. This change in free cash flow also was driven by working capital improvements, as well as lower spending on instruments. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $48 million, including $29 million for instruments and $19 million for property, plant and equipment. Cash outlays associated with investing activities during the quarter include $35 million for acquisitions, most notably, the Synvasive transaction. ", "I'd like to turn now to our guidance for 2012. In our earnings release this morning, we announced that the company is reaffirming its constant currency revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. In addition, the company is updating its full year reported revenue and reported or GAAP EPS guidance. We expect full year revenues to increase between 2% and 4% in constant currency when compared to 2011. The company now estimates that foreign currency translation will decrease revenues by approximately 1.5% to 2% for the full year 2012, resulting in reported revenue growth between 0% and 2.5%. Previously, the company had estimated foreign currency translation would decrease revenues by approximately 1%. ", "In the second quarter, foreign currency translation is expected to decrease revenues by 2.5%. As we indicated in our fourth quarter conference call, we expect lower revenue growth in the first half compared to the second half. This is due principally to the cadence of new product launches, but also the challenging prior year comparables caused in part by a large knee tender in our Europe, Middle East, Africa operating segment in the second quarter of 2011. With the change in outlook for foreign currency due to relative strength in the U.S. dollar, we now anticipate hedge losses to moderate and the gross margin ratio for the year to be at or near the top end of our prior range of 74% to 75%. Our guidance for R&D and SG&A expenses for the full year remains unchanged. However, as we continue to fund strategic initiatives, our SG&A expense in the second quarter is expected to be at or near the high end of our full year guidance range of 39.5% to 40.5%. Full year 2012 adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be in the range of $5.20 to $5.40. To arrive at the GAAP earnings per share, you should subtract total charges for special items of $125 million pretax or approximately $0.50 per share. This compares with prior guidance of $110 million pretax or approximately $0.45 per share. The increase in special items pertains to a certain contract dispute and integration costs connected with the recently closed Synvasive Technology acquisition. ", "Finally, please note that our guidance does not include any impact from potential new acquisitions or other unforeseen events. David, I'll turn the call back over to you.", "David C. Dvorak", "Thanks, Jim. Earlier this year, the breadth of our innovation pipeline was on display at the AAOS Annual Meeting, where we featured exciting new products in almost every product category, from implants to intelligent instruments and power equipment. These offerings received a very strong customer response, which further reinforces our excitement about the ongoing positive impact of innovation. Sustained growth through 2012 will be driven by a continued focus on our strategic priorities. Progress in our business transformation programs and disciplined financial management enable us to continue to generate high levels of operating cash flow, which we're directing toward investments in growth drivers, including our sales channel, product development and infrastructure in emerging markets. ", "In summary, we remain on track to meet our sales, earnings and cash flow expectations for 2012. Accelerated growth in the second half of the year will be achieved through continued execution of our strategic initiatives and the contributions of new product offerings. And now I'd like to ask Lachey to begin the Q&A portion of our call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Bruce Nudell from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Dave, I know everybody's going to ask, you noted a step up in pricing pressure, could you kind of give us a little color on where it rose and why it rose? And your view now as to where net ASPs across price and mix could be held?", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure. We had a step-up in price pressure. I guess, as we look at our numbers across -- modest step-ups, Bruce, across each of the geographic segments. And I would say that within the product categories, a bit Knees and a bit in Spine, and those were the primary growth drivers. I would tell you that I don't think that any of these is different than our expectations coming in the year. It's more of the same. As we talked about on prior calls, we had some factors that were improving our price performance, including overseas forward acquisitions of distributors in prior periods. So I would deem this to be more of the same environmentally, just a modest step-up in those 2 product categories. But I don't expect this to be the beginning of a more significant negative trend.", "Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And so like net ASPs, where do you think it could be across price mix?", "David C. Dvorak", "It just depends on where we are in the process of innovation and product rollout, Bruce. I mean, I think that at this point, probably at its peak, you could wash it out. I think that with big system launches, and I would expect that we're going to have nice opportunity in coming periods and moving into next year to do that in the knee product category. We don't have the capability to do that right now. We have a bit more of a capability to wash some of that negative price out in our hip business with mix, but not fully wash it out.", "Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And I guess, just on -- my follow-up is, and this is more of a schematic question. How do you view the opportunity for like custom implants in the minority of patients who have really odd anatomy and/or unique pathology? And do you think that, that could be a significant driver over the medium term for mix for the industry?", "David C. Dvorak", "I believe that the personalized solutions is a theme that we've been very focused on. You can see it with our product innovations across all of our product portfolios. I do believe that better clinical solutions can be gained through these personalized solutions. I believe that, frankly, the patient expectations are going to continue to rise. And their belief that they're going to be able to get back to active lifestyles and restore the quality of life that they once knew is going to cause innovation to move in the direction to be responsive to -- that asked by the patients. And so I absolutely believe in the personalized solutions. I wouldn't want that to be misconstrued with the customized term because I think that there are some nuance differences there. But identifying the most relevant clinical characteristics of a patient and ensuring that we're able to help the surgeon have everything that they need to replicate the human anatomy that, that individual started with is a big area of focus. And again, you've seen it in many of our product categories. You're going to see it to an even greater extent going forward through our innovation pipeline.", "Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And so, Dave, just to be specific, that might be inclusive of implants that are designed for individuals as opposed to customized cutting guides at least over the midterm?", "David C. Dvorak", "I believe it's going to be implants that meet their characteristics in -- of that particular patient in any respect that is clinically relevant. And the key is going to be to innovate in a way where one is able to bring that solution to the hospital systems and surgeons and, ultimately, patients in a cost-effective manner. Because as you can imagine, that creates a SKU challenge. But I think that if one innovates intelligently, they're going to be able to solve that challenge and provide a better outcome in a very cost-effective way.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So just to be clear on pricing, you guys came into the year guiding to recon pricing to be down roughly 200 basis points, I think you said. Is that guidance still good for the year in your view?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, that guidance is in the right range, Bob. I mean, it may tick up a couple of tenths, but that's primarily as a consequence of the Japan biannual price declines coming in a little bit higher than what we had modeled coming into the year. So I think that, that is the right range of a number still.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And what in Japan -- could you quantify that? How much -- what is the pricing decline that you expected and what do you think it's going to be now in reality?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, I think in -- across the product categories, we were expecting something in the range of mid single digits. And I would say if you do the math, it comes in a couple of points higher than that.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, so high-single-digit declines?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, and just to complete that line of thought and be clear, Bob, I think what that means to us is a couple of tenths increased price pressure on a consolidated basis. So if you do the math, we were expecting that to contribute about 30 basis points of price headwind on a consolidated basis and it looks more like 50 at this point.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, great. So the only thing that's changed is Japan, in other words, in your pricing outlook?", "David C. Dvorak", "That's really true.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then just to be clear, everybody's been asking this. Because of the leap year, do you -- was it a clear comparison in terms of selling days year-over-year for you guys or did you have an extra selling day? And if so, how did that impact the numbers?", "David C. Dvorak", "We didn't have an extra selling day. I just -- you go back to the federal calendar, Bob, and essentially you picked up a day in February, obviously, and then gave it back in the month of March. So within a couple of tenths across the globe with respect to selling days, it was an even comparison year-over-year.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just real quickly on operating margin. You guys came into the year expecting that you'd have roughly a 20 to 30-basis-point increase year-over-year in 2012. Yes, you're starting out the year with a slight decrease. Are you still comfortable that as your revenues ramp a little bit in the back half that you'll be able to drive 20 to 30-basis-points in operating margin year-over-year?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, we are comfortable. We believe that we're going to realize the promise of the new products that are being introduced, Bob, and step up on the top line. So in the meantime, we're driving the transformation initiatives, seeing good returns and right on pace with those programs. And that's helping fund some of the upfront money that's going to take to fully exploit those product launches. So both those dynamics are headed in the right direction, and we just need to execute and realize the benefits of those new products on the top line.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Adam Feinstein from Barclays Capital.", "Daniel Sollof - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "It's actually Dan stepping in for Adam. I want to ask a real quick question on -- to start up with knees, which came in a bit better than we're expecting. So in last quarter, you talked about it reverting back to normalized growth, and I guess, this quarter you're talking about kind of cautious optimism for some improvement. Can you just talk about what you're seeing in that market and at best you can see how we're kind of reverting back to that normalized level of growth?", "James T. Crines", "Sure. Yes, I think, Dan, when we spoke about a normalized level of growth, that was more with the longer-term view just to continuously reinforce in these discussions that these are procedure deferrals. These are not patients that go away or have another solution. And so the demographic drivers clearly are going to produce a good number of patients that need these solutions in coming years. And with the macroeconomic conditions being what they have, we just believe that there's been increased procedural deferment. And so when we talk about normalizing the market or normalized procedures, we're referring to the longer term dynamic of as the economy stabilizes and ultimately, at some point in the future, begins to improve and we're creating more jobs on a global basis, those patients are going to come back into the fold. And it just is a matter of when and what pace. So one quarter, and this is principally a comment that is directed towards the U.S. knee market performance, which as you'll recall was more heavily impacted by the economic downturn. And the thought was because of the pain pathology, it was a bit easier relative to hips to defer those procedures. So this uptake sequentially from Q4 to Q1 of this year in the market for U.S. knees is a positive sign. But that said, it's one quarter.", "Daniel Sollof - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Great, that's helpful. And just one quick follow-up. Just looking at Europe, you guys are actually seeing to perform pretty well, but we're seeing kind of -- you're thinking of that mid-single-digit growth level of the challenge with that market. So as best that you guys would you characterize the environment as kind of stable there or do you think it's kind of more of a share take that really allows you to kind of keep growth where it's at in that region?", "David C. Dvorak", "Well, I think that, that market and Europe is stable. But I will tell you within Europe, there's a lot going on. There are big differences among countries due to the austerity measures. There are even differences intra-country within the large joint categories. We clearly have been performing well in our Europe, Middle East and Africa segment. And I don't know how the numbers could be construed in any manner over the last many quarters other than we're taking share because I believe that, that's a market on the recon side that is growing low single digits as opposed to the numbers that we're posting that have been closer to mid single digits. So I think that you're going to continue to have a lot of puts and takes within Europe. Those are very different markets amalgamated, and it's something that we talked about as EMEA. But I also feel good about our capability to continue the momentum in that market and outperform the market in order to produce the growth that we need to.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "David, could you just talk about the cadence project transformation, the $400 million in cost savings and how much of that benefit you think we'll see this year and next?", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure. We -- I would tell you that it's pretty evenly spread, Mike, in the way of benefit. We're probably at a benefit run rate coming out of last year round numbers about -- of about $50 million. And this year, we would look to be at a run rate in excess of $100 million. And so you can sort of spread the remaining $250 million out over the course of the 5-year program the way we've defined it. In the front end of that 5-year program, obviously, we're using the benefits of it to reinvest in key areas. We've expanded sales forces. We build infrastructure in key emerging markets. We've increased our investments in key areas of our product development to execute our strategies there. So we're able to fund all of that. And as you can see in this quarter, improved -- yet still improve our SG&A ratio, not as much as it would have improved had we let all the benefits of the transformation initiatives flow through, but we're pacing that out in accordance with our strategic priorities and where we see opportunities to create significant value. So that's the framework is to how we look at -- and we also want to emphasize that our expectation is that we would fully absorb the med device tax through these programs as well. So the consequence of some of the needed strategic investments on the front end of that 5-year program and then the need to absorb the medical device tax, should that come through in 2013, more of the savings are not revealed on the performance of the P&L on the front end of the program. But as we work through those time periods, you'll see more drop-through through those programs and more significant improvement in the operations side, which will obviously lag but ultimately flow through to the COGS line as well.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "On that pricing question from earlier, do you have a more of an apples-to-apples comparison on what 2011 pricing would have been down x the distributor buy-ins?", "David C. Dvorak", "I don't have a specific number, Mike. I would tell you that I would range that to have been a few tenths on a consolidated basis.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "A few tenths of benefit in 2011?", "David C. Dvorak", "That's right, as far as consolidated pricing.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then last, on the investment side on the sales force. I know you're building out a specialized sales force in Biologics. Is there anywhere else where you're adding personnel at this point?", "David C. Dvorak", "We have sort of hybrid models across a variety of product categories. In some instances, they are product specialists. In other instances, they're direct reps. I would tell you that over the last 12 to 18 months, Trauma has been an area of focus for us.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matt Miksic from Piper Jaffray.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "So I realized it's early in the year you're on the ortho trends that we're seeing. I caught your comments, I apologize you were all juggling a few calls. But I wanted -- I was wondering, it seems like the way things work in ortho often is you're growing a little faster on one side, maybe on your hip side. You're not growing as fast on the knee side. All this having to go through the same rep and the same operations basically. Are you seeing any of that due to the strength in your -- some of the hip products that you mentioned? And secondly, is that something that you would expect would balance out maybe in the back half of the year as you get PERSONA up and running or into next year. Some color on that would be helpful, and then I have a follow-up.", "David C. Dvorak", "Okay, Matt. I mean, the reality of this Q1 performance is we're pretty balanced as between knees and hips. As you can see, it's mid-2% growth rates in each of those categories. I would tell you that I think that the geographic segments have done a pretty good job of balancing that focus. We've had, over the last year, a bit more in the way of new product opportunities on the hip side. I think that as we get deeper into this year, that's going to balance out and -- at least balance out, if not even tip, to the knee side as we enter 2013. So we're excited about the position that we're putting them into to compete on both knees and hips. And just geographically, I think that among the 3 segments that we operate under, we see the opportunity for more improvement in the Americas group than the o U.S. groups at this point in time in, frankly, both knees and hips.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay, all right. And then I guess, just looking out, maybe do you have enough on the hip side to withstand the attention that the new knee is going to bring to the knee side? Is it this Vitamin E poly that you mentioned or what do you think are the opportunities there that take you through '13, maybe not to push you too far out?", "David C. Dvorak", "I think that it's a good question, because we're really excited about what's coming out of it the knee side, and I do feel good about our ability to balance that out. We have leveraging the technologies, Trabecular Metal, the best wear characteristics in polyethylene with Longevity. And now, a next-generation polyethylene with VIVACIT-E. And then you add to all of that the offerings that are in developments but have been previewed to some extent on the intelligent instrument front, and I think you have a really exciting hip package going forward.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay. And then one if I could on the P&L, and I apologize, David, because you've been talking back and forth here. But you mentioned something about making some investments -- strategic investments important to your execution on new products. Could I ask you to maybe provide a little detail as to what went into some of the SG&A spend in the quarter? I don't know where it was relative to consensus, but maybe it was just a touch more than we were expecting. That would be helpful.", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure. I'll let Jim respond.", "James T. Crines", "We did see some slightly higher spending in SG&A in the quarter. Nonetheless, we're holding to the guidance we've given to the full year of 39.5% to 40.5%. So we're confident with the savings that we're driving and the transformation programs that we're going to be able to drive that leverage in the back half of the year. In fact, even in spite of the higher spending that we're projecting for the first half of the year, we're still seeing year-over-year improvement in SG&A. And just to give you some idea, those higher expenses that we experienced in the first quarter added approximately 90 basis points SG&A in the quarter when compared to the prior year, and they included, as we mentioned, recruiting and relocation costs associated with some of the hiring that we're doing, particularly around sales and marketing to support some of the efforts we have in place around these new platforms. And we did as well incur some higher expenses in the quarter related to legal matters, which are described in great detail on our periodic filings.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Market.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Two clarifications, you said that some of the cost savings are expected to absorb the med tech tax in 2013. Do you plan to totally absorb that or somewhat?", "David C. Dvorak", "We plan to totally absorb that, Joanne.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, because our calculation is at about $0.25, $0.26, okay? Second question, the new NexGen knee, I hate to ask a stupid question. What's the name of that product?", "David C. Dvorak", "The NexGen knee system is unnamed at this point in time.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okie dokie. And what are -- can you just walk us through the game plan for the launch? Usually these launches take about 12 months until they're fully up. Is that a similar pace that you'll be playing at for this product?", "David C. Dvorak", "That's the right way to think about it, Joanne. I -- we would move through -- phase launch would start with developer release, and then move into a limited release and then a broader limited release and then leading up to a more general release. But then with these systems, even when you get to the point of a general release, you're pacing out instruments. It would be ultimately many, many sets -- thousands of sets of instruments. And so this will be a global launch that we look forward to in the coming few years as opposed to just a 12-month time period.", "James T. Crines", "And Joanne, this is Jim. Just coming back to the comment you made about the med device tax. At this point, the best that we can estimate is somewhere in the order of $50 million to $60 million pretax on 2013, and understand -- fully understand that we need to drive at an incremental $50 million to $60 million of savings out of these programs to fully offset that tax in 2013.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Derrick Sung from Sanford Bernstein.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "I wanted to ask you about the increase in your receivables as a result of the Southern European crisis that you called out. This is something that we've been hearing from all of the companies. We've been hearing it's been taking upwards of a year, in fact, in some areas to collect. And I was just wondering if you could give us some details around what specifically are you seeing? Is this coming from the hospitals? Is it coming from distributors? Maybe just a little bit color on how it's affecting your business. And how close are -- at what point does it have a material impact, either on cash flows or at what point does it have a material impact on sales when you stop or pull back on selling into these accounts if they aren't paying in an appropriate time period?", "James T. Crines", "Sure, this is Jim. And as we have indicated in our prepared remarks, we saw a 4-day increase in the day sales outstanding in the quarter on a consolidated basis, and that was driven by a combination of some of the growth we're seeing, frankly, out of emerging markets where we have some longer payment terms in place. But also by an increase in receivables in certain Southern European markets and, in particular, in Italy and Spain. We are providing some detail in our periodic filings around the balance of our net receivables as it relates to Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece. But I would tell you, Portugal and Greece are not really material relative to the larger receivable balances we have in Italy and Spain. It's something that we're paying very close attention to. It is the case, at least with respect to Zimmer, that we're seeing it in the public hospitals. We continue and we will continue to supply product into the public hospitals, but we're just not, at this stage, able to collect those receivables as quickly as we'd like to. There -- I would tell you a number of things that we understand, we need to continue to pay close attention to, to ensure that ultimately we do get paid for the products that are being supplied to those hospitals there. It's important to maintain really good documentation. We have an opportunity in those markets to have government officials, periodically certify what's owed and we work that process hard to ensure that when the funds are made available, and we continue to believe they will be. In fact, we know that there's a program that was just recently announced in Spain that we believe will result in some significant payment flow in the second half of this year with respect to our public hospitals receivables in Spain. So again, we're paying close attention to it. We're providing some detailed information in our periodic filings with respect to what those net receivable balances are in those countries, and we'll continue to do that.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Great. That's very helpful. Just going back to your new knee launch here. I was wondering if you could give some details around what you're including in this first phase that got approved? What's the value proposition here? What specific products are being included in this first rollout? And then what -- when you expect the next phases to kind of come in?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes. Sorry, we're just not willing to do that at this point in time. It's a big project. It's a system that we're extraordinarily excited about, but we're going to work the process in a methodical way to serve the interest of the owners of the company here and get this one right, and we just don't want to get out ahead of it. So I apologize, but I can't share more at this point in time. And it's the same response with respect to Joanne to go down the path of naming features and benefits, it just would be premature for us to do that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bill Plovanic from Canaccord Genuity.", "William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "My question just revolves around there's a couple of times you referenced new products really driving growth, and I think somebody had asked a little bit about this. But I was wondering if you could elaborate on what you believe the most important projects are for you or products that will drive that growth as we enter the back half of this year?", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure. So the themes of these product launches are personalized solutions across the various categories and a lot of technology development with respect to intelligent instruments to ensure that implantations are as accurate as they possibly can be that lead to better wear characteristics, better fit, feel and function for the patient. And so we have a lot rolling out across the various categories within knees, PSI for our eLIBRA Dynamic Knee Balancing System. On the revision side, the TM Cones and Augments and then ultimately bigger things with the next-generation knee system. Hips, we've launched and we're ramping up CLS Brevius with Kinectiv Technology. The Maxera large diameter head ceramic-on-ceramic outside the United States and, ultimately, as this year progresses globally, VIVACIT-E highly cross-linked polyethylene. Extremities, Anatomical Shoulder combined adapter is doing very well and is helping us there. We have other launches but they're fairly late in the year, so they are going to have less of an impact on 2012 but a significant impact on 2013. Trauma, we continue to expand our NCB Periprosthetic plate line. We have now fully rolled out the XtraFix External Fixation System. So those are big product areas for us within Trauma. Spine, we're doing very well with TM-S, the cervical -- Trabecular Metal Interbody, the inViZia Anterior Cervical Plate and we have more coming up in the way of launches with respect to buildout of pedicle screw systems in the second half of the year. Dental just now launched the TM Dental Implant, and beginning o U.S. with the Zfx CAD/CAM digital dentistry solutions package. Within the surgical line, we look to do big things with the SoPlus Power Tool Equipment line and then the Synvasive blade technology line. And then finally, we continue to ramp sales nicely under the biologics area with DeNovo NT, just launched Chondrofix and we'd hope to get into a full release of the Gel-One product line. So a lot going on.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I just wanted to go back to pricing. You had said it was down 2% across the total company. Would you be willing to break out pricing by different geographic regions?", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure, Kristen. It was minus 2.8% in Americas, minus 1.0% in Europe and minus 0.7% in Asia-Pacific. And so the Q1 pricing as compared to the fourth quarter, we're at minus 1.6%. And as we said, it's minus 2.0% this quarter.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Right, and I don't have the other numbers right in front of me for 4Q, but it looks like it was probably Americas that got a little bit worse. Is that true sequentially, I guess?", "David C. Dvorak", ";", "It was a little bit in each of those categories, within 2 to 4 tenths in each of those categories per segment.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And I guess the message that you guys are trying to convey is that despite the tick-up in this quarter, you guys are still comfortable generally with your guidance that you outlined back in December of negative 2% consolidated for the full year?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes. And I think that you could see that bump up from negative 2% to negative 2.5%. But more than anything else, that's driven by the price headwind that we're going to be facing in Japan, which was a bit higher than what we had believed was going to be the case coming in the year. None of that for us reads as a fundamental shift in price headwind. And we're very confident we're going to be able to offset that. In other respects, we have a lot of opportunity to do so.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then Jim, I just wanted to go through and better understand your commentary around gross margin. Because I know you'd said some of the hedges were going to moderate, and you expect that gross profit margin to be, I just want to make sure I understood it, at or near the top end now of the range. So maybe can you help us just put into context maybe the ever-so-slight increase in pricing pressure? What's kind of, I guess, driving your expectations now to be a little be more on the higher end versus kind of anywhere else within the range given pricing?", "James T. Crines", "Sure. So we understand very well that in every point of decline in average selling prices can put somewhere in the order of 20 to 25 basis points in pressure on gross margin. We've talked, as David just did, about where we are with pricing and what our expectations are for the full year. And that certainly is something we've taken into account in the updated guidance we've provided on gross margin. As we said now, our expectation now for gross margin to be at or near the high end of the 74% to 75% range we provided at the beginning of the year. So those -- to the extent we've raised our expectation for the effect of currency translation on our top line from 1% to now 1.5% to 2%, there's some significant moderation in those hedge losses. We -- relative to what we were looking at the beginning of the year, they fully offset that slightly higher pressure we're getting on margin from pricing trends.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. So it's more of just a reflection of the FX change versus any higher cost savings or mix benefit that you would expect?", "James T. Crines", "With respect to 2012, that's correct. Obviously, getting down 2012, we'd be certainly looking for the manufacturing quality excellence initiative that would begin delivering some cost savings to offset some of that pressure, that negative price is putting on gross margin.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I wonder if I could ask a bit about volume and mix. I think you gave the constituent or at least aggregate numbers for each those, 4.8%, 4.9%, I believe it was for knees and hips. Could you parse those out and give us a sense of what volumes are doing right now?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes. We just -- we're not going to give you all the details on that at this point, but we'll try to help with the following. Right now, we're getting more mix in hips, but it's not fully offsetting the negative price. And we're getting some mix in certain geographic regions in knees but not offsetting the price. And so I do believe that with the coming product launches, we're going to be able to improve the mix to offset in hips and materially improve the mix to offset in knees. I will tell you that we still firmly believe that clinically relevant innovation can be received with price premiums. You have to be more cognizant of the stakeholders and the conditions that they're operating in to try to achieve the cost objectives at the same time that you're providing better patient outcomes. And so that means building out more empirical evidence to be able to have that discussion and land where you want to land in that discussion, but the opportunity is clearly there. So I think that right now, we're probably, overall, are on the low end in a consolidated basis of mix, helping the top line growth and profitability of the business. But I'm very, very confident that we're poised to improve that position in the coming quarters.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And because one of the things that's been postulated in terms of why we see a slight uptick, perhaps, in knee growth this quarter was maybe we've seen a higher percentage of revisions, which is pulling up the ASP per procedures. Are you guys seeing that in the near results?", "David C. Dvorak", "We are. The revision is a component of the positive mix opportunity and that contributes. But I would tell you that overall, I don't think that there's a lot of positive mix in the knee market right now. Just because of the cycle of launches, I think that, that's going to change fairly significantly in 2013.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Understood. And then just kind of lastly. It's been 7 or 8 quarters now that we've been running kind of 1% or 2% growth in these markets, and you guys remain confident as does most everybody in the industry that we'll see a tickup at some point. But at some point, do we concede that, perhaps, this market is going to grow in terms of volumes maybe in the very low single digits? Or if that just maybe the new reality we're dealing with in orthopedics?", "David C. Dvorak", "I don't believe so. I mean, I just -- I don't believe that the demographics bear that out. The penetration rates for these solutions would have to decline and be sustained in a decline mode for that to become the case. So I still believe that you're going to tick up in procedure growth rates as the economic conditions stabilize.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "David, there's been a lot of questions on price this morning. And I guess, the one thing we are hearing from you is you're extremely optimistic about the new product launches for the company. I guess, really a 2-part question. First, it doesn't sound like we're seeing a mix-driven new product benefit sort of in 2012, but it sounds like in your last comment, 2013 may be the period where we see more significant mix. So number one, I mean, do you expect to see mix impact price on a positive way as we head into 2013? And the second kind of related question is, and what we are getting this year is a dramatic amount of hospitals telling us that they are hiring consultants and very interested in bundling in ACO-like programs. I mean, looking at the Americas pricing this quarter, is ACO something we should be seriously considering as a change in the structural pricing environment? Or as your way of thinking about it, is it simply more of the same?", "David C. Dvorak", "Good question. So I would tell you that with respect to mix, I do believe that we're going to sequentially improve in that regard. I would tell you that every quarter that goes by this year, we would expect to improve our mixed position, and that's going to be part of what drives top line growth. But probably more significantly in 2012, we're entering some new product categories, and so those are going to be significant growth drivers. As we get into 2013, the mix opportunity is going to become more significant across our large categories. So we're really optimistic about what we're going to be able to achieve with the right kind of innovation, which segues into the second part of your question. I think that whether you're talking about ACOs or bundling or, frankly, a lot of that discussion is premised upon gain sharing-type principles. And so I do believe that there's going to be a receptivity and engagement level for those models to move forward. But the discussion fundamentally is going to come back to innovation and service, and that's where we need to be forward-looking and understanding the environment that we're operating in, and we're very cognizant of those dynamics because I think at the end of the day, it is more of the same. Where you're having pricing discussions and fundamental value exchange discussions with the cost of that value, the cost of delivery from the customers' perspective. And if we innovate in a clinically relevant way and prove out the benefits of those innovations and we're cognizant of the cost objectives that the customers are going to have and the value proposition from their perspective, I think we're going to win in any of those environments, whether it's ACOs, bundling or the kinds of the pricing negotiations that we have currently.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And just maybe one quick one. On utilization focus, obviously, is in focus for a lot of people. In the quarter, you mentioned Trauma was strong, even though we had a relatively mild winter. And obviously, we have seen a correlation between weather and Trauma in the past, and there are some who believe that the weather season also contributed to an increase in utilization. Is there any possibility in your mind that, that could have enabled higher knee growth in the quarter?", "David C. Dvorak", "Oh, you're saying that the mild weather might positively influence the large-joint procedures?", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "It hasn't historically, but there is a view that utilization this quarter was impacted by a milder weather season. Just to base on the nature of the disease, I would expect that not to impact your business, but any thoughts on weather impacting knee upturn?", "David C. Dvorak", "I don't believe it. I think that it can be the case with a very severe storm to where you might have a disrupted operating week because patients can't get in. But I think that, that stuff typically would even clean up within a short period of time, month, a quarter, unless they're just repeated storms. I don't think that there is too much to that theory. I do think that weather does impact the market within the Trauma sector, but I don't see it having a significant impact on the large joint side.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.", "Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just two for me. First, David, you said sales growth should accelerate in the second half of 2012, and you talked about the European knee tender in the second quarter of last year. Is that the only reason why you might -- I mean, were you trying to indicate that you would expect a little bit slower sales growth in the second quarter? And if so, can you quantify the European knee tender for us?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes. We're pointing that out really so the people understand what we would anticipate in that category. We think that we're on a good track, but there's going to be a comparable bit of headwind coming out of the European segment in particular with knee. So it's going to be a progression. With these new products, we believe that you're going to see some significant improvement in some of the product categories sequentially from Q1 to Q2. But a bit of that is going to be offset by the prior year comp in the knee side. Quantifying it, Jim?", "James T. Crines", "Yes. Larry, without getting too deep into the weeds. If you were to go back and look at last year second quarter, you would have seen knee sales in Europe, we're up 9% in a market that was flat to maybe up in single digits. And while it didn't account for all of our growth, it was a significant contributor to that 9% growth. So hopefully, that gives you some sense of what we're up against.", "Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "That's helpful. Sure -- sorry to interrupt, Jim. And lastly, I'm relatively new to this call. David, could we get your view on robotics, please?", "David C. Dvorak", "Robotics, I will tell you that we are big believers in incorporating technologies, developing technologies to improve the precision with which these procedures are done. And a lot of that comes, obviously, into preparing the site, the bone cuts but as well a more sophisticated approaches to soft tissue balancing, precise location of implants. There's a lot to be done here, and I think it's a very exciting area of innovation. That said, that innovation needs to be fashioned in a way that recognizes the price pressure and the environmental factors that the customers are operating within. And I just don't think that the right solution is going to be an ultra-expensive piece of capital equipment than -- or expensive licensing fees to provide a service that arguably is -- they would argue, is a value driver. I believe that the right answer in that space is going to be technologies and solutions that are smaller, faster and cheaper than the robotics solutions at this point in time. Now that said, it's going to be all about how things evolve and what areas innovate more rapidly in a manner that's more responsive to the customers needs. But the platforms that we are rolling out, that we have been working on for several years, I firmly believe are going to be more responsive to that segment through the market and the needs than the current robotics solutions. ", "So I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today and for your continued interest and support for Zimmer. We look forward to speaking to you on the second quarter conference call at 8 a.m. on July 26, 2012.

I would like to turn the call over to Bob Marshall, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Marshall, you may begin your call.", "Robert J. Marshall", "Thank you, Regina. Good morning, and welcome to Zimmer's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. I'm here with our CEO, David Dvorak; and our CFO, Jim Crines. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.", "Also, the discussions during this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included within the earnings release, which is available on our website at investor.zimmer.com.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to David Dvorak. David?", "David C. Dvorak", "Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Zimmer's earnings call for the third quarter of 2012. This morning, I'll review our third quarter financial results, providing commentary on the year's progress to date and highlights from our performance. Jim will then provide additional financial details. As in previous quarters, I'll state all sales in constant currency terms, and I'll discuss all earnings results on an adjusted basis.", "At the beginning of the year, we articulated a goal of generating 8% to 12% growth in earnings per share in an environment of low to mid single-digit top line growth. We indicated that this goal would be achieved through the successful execution of strategic initiatives, including significant product introductions across the portfolio, the continued execution of our transformation agenda and rigorous management of capital. I'm glad to report that we remain on track to deliver against this commitment in 2012. Further, we believe progress across each of our strategic priorities will position Zimmer to achieve our value-creation objectives through the remainder of the year and into 2013.", "Consolidated net sales for the third quarter were $1.03 billion, an increase of 2.5%, and our earnings per share were $1.15, an increase of 10.6% over the prior year period. Compared to prior year, Americas sales grew 0.5%, while Europe, Middle East and Africa delivered growth of 7.9%, and Asia-Pacific recorded sales growth of 1.6%. For the third quarter, our Americas sales were negatively affected by 1 fewer billing day, while our Europe, Middle East and Africa and Asia-Pacific sales benefited from an additional billing day.", "In the quarter, we recorded strong performances in Europe, Middle East and Africa and in certain emerging markets in Asia-Pacific. These results reflect the benefit of operational and sales force investments in these regions. We continue to pursue similar commercial excellence efforts in the United States to ensure at or above market performance across our sales territories both here and abroad. Progress in these efforts, combined with ongoing and upcoming new product introductions across the portfolio, will contribute to improved performance in the future.", "Turning now to the results of our product categories. Knee sales for the third quarter increased year-over-year 0.5%, reflecting positive volume and mix of 3.3% and negative price of 2.8%. Our international operating segments delivered strong knee sales growth of 8.7% in Europe, Middle East and Africa, and 4.3% in the Asia-Pacific region compared with the prior year.", "During the quarter, we generated increased sales of our intelligent instrument offerings, including Zimmer Patient Specific Instruments for our NexGen and Natural total knee systems in the Zimmer Unicompartmental High Flex Knee System, as well as the eLIBRA Dynamic Knee Balancing System. In many markets, we're beginning to see accelerated adoption rates of these intelligent instrument systems, which offer hospitals the potential to drive more consistent clinical outcomes and procedural and logistical efficiencies.", "Also in the quarter, we continued the limited developer release of our Next Generation Knee System, PERSONA, the personalized knee system. This exciting new system builds upon the tremendous clinical legacy of our NexGen and Natural Knee Systems, leveraging fundamental aspects of these designs, while adding new technologies and innovations that allow for much greater personalization and improved performance. Coupled with our intelligent instrument offerings, the PERSONA Knee System will allow surgeons to personalize the best possible fit for each patient, which we believe will lead to a more natural-feeling knee. We look forward greatly to the benefits of the broader release of PERSONA in 2013.", "Hip sales in the third quarter increased 1.6%, reflecting positive volume and mix of 4.4%, and negative price of 2.8%. In the quarter, our Americas and Europe, Middle East and Africa operating segments delivered an improved performance, while in Asia-Pacific, sales declined slightly compared with prior year due primarily to the previously discussed pricing pressure in Japan.", "Across our hip portfolio, we continue to drive benefit from our proprietary technology platforms, including Trabecular Metal Technology, which offers a differentiated advantage in the revision market, as well as its applications and primary acetabular cups and stems.", "In the quarter, we also continued the introduction of our VIVACIT-E Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene in the United States, and will soon make this advanced material available to certain European markets.", "Extremities recorded above market sales growth of 12.3% in the third quarter. Recently introduced products supported by improved sales execution contributed to this performance. Globally, our Anatomical combined shoulder system and Trabecular Metal Reverse Shoulder System recorded impressive growth. In Europe, Middle East and Africa, the Sidus Stem-Free Shoulder System is providing opportunities for new account conversions in a growing category of the shoulder replacement market.", "In the quarter, we also received FDA clearance for our new Trabecular Metal Total Ankle replacement system, which provides us with an entry point for the lower extremities market. This exciting new system that incorporates our Trabecular Metal technology is designed to support a novel innovative lateral surgical approach. First surgeries have taken place for this product over the past several weeks, and we're excited for its broader commercial introduction in 2013.", "Our Dental business delivered sales growth of 3.5% in the third quarter amid a challenging market, which continues to be impacted by suppressed procedure volume in key European and Asia-Pacific markets in particular. In the quarter, our Americas growth was attributable to the revenues associated with the Exopro acquisition, the Brazilian manufacturer of differentiated dental implant products in the P-I Br\u00e5nemark Philosophy.", "Globally, sales growth in the third quarter was supported by a number of recently introduced products, including the Trabecular Metal Dental Implant, the IngeniOs value line of synthetic bone graft, and Zfx Digital Dentistry Solutions.", "In the third quarter, we again delivered above-market sales growth in all geographic segments in our Trauma business. Sales increased 10.8% over the prior year period, including standout 24% growth in Europe, Middle East and Africa. Globally, new products in the Trauma portfolio are driving significant growth in this business.", "The Zimmer Natural Nail family once again delivered strong sales, while the XtraFix External Fixation System continues to provide entry opportunities for new accounts.", "Complementing our hip revision products, the NCB Periprosthetic Plating System is driving growth in existing reconstructive accounts as part of a revision total continuum of care solution.", "Zimmer's Spine business reported a sales decrease of 7.4% in the third quarter. We continue to face significant challenges in this business related to pricing and utilization.", "In the Cervical Interbody and Outerbody segment and in Minimally Invasive Solutions, we are developing a competitive portfolio. Recently introduced products in these categories continue to deliver solid sales results. This week at the North American Spine Society meeting, we are highlighting our differentiated InViZia cervical plating system and the Trabecular Metal Ardis Interbody System.", "In the third quarter, Zimmer's Surgical and Other business category again delivered above market sales growth of 10.7% over the prior year period. Recently introduced products contributed meaningful growth in this business. Specifically, the Zimmer surgical power equipment line and Synvasive line of surgical blade continue to present significant opportunities.", "At the end of the third quarter, Zimmer further expanded our surgical products portfolio through the acquisition of Dornoch Medical Systems, a medical waste management technology company. Dornoch offers a comprehensive range of medical waste fluid disposal equipment and accessories, including its patented Transposal integrated infectious fluid collection and disposal system.", "We continue to generate encouraging growth rates from our early intervention technologies, which include a broad range of products across the continuum of care. In particular, we're seeing increased utilization of our DeNovo and Chondrofix cartilage repair products.", "Another early intervention technology for patients with knee arthritis is our Gel-One injectable hyaluronic acid product. In an important development in the quarter, we successfully defended Gel-One in patent litigation. We're pleased that the jury returned a verdict in our favor. Gel-One offers further opportunities for us to expand our reach earlier in the continuum of care for knee arthritis, which is a strategically important area for the company.", "Turning now from our product category results, I'd like to discuss several broad market factors. Reconstructive procedures in the third quarter were slightly lower than expected in certain key markets around the world due to uncertainty in the macro environment. As Jim will discuss, we've adjusted our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year accordingly, yet we remain confident that a robust product pipeline will enhance our revenue growth as we look beyond 2012. Specifically, revenue growth is expected to improve as we make necessary investments in our sales channel and other areas concurrent with the launch of many new products, including the PERSONA knee system, VIVACIT-E Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene for hips, the Sidus stem-free shoulder, the Trabecular Metal total ankle replacement, the Gel-One single injection hyaluronic acid product and Zimmer's surgical power equipment, as well as the recently acquired Transposal waste management devices.", "We experienced price pressure of negative 2.1% in the third quarter, in line with our expectations. We're confident full year pricing for 2012 will remain at or near negative 2%, consistent with our guidance. The mix benefit of new product sales contributions across the portfolio, many of which incorporate premium price technologies, enabled Zimmer to partially offset price pressure in several of our franchises.", "In the third quarter, we made further progress in the transformation agenda we're pursuing across our commercial and corporate operations. Notable steps taken included progress in strategic sourcing, distribution and advanced manufacturing activities. As well as making Zimmer a more effective and efficient organization, our transformation programs generate substantial cash flows. We're deploying this cash and capital in a disciplined fashion, returning excess value to our stockholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs and pursuing prudent acquisition opportunities.", "Finally, this quarter, we celebrated 15 years of clinical success for Trabecular Metal Technology, and we're truly only just beginning to scratch the surface of its potential. This technology has now been used in more than 750,000 procedures helping literally hundreds of thousands of patients return to active lifestyles. In many applications, Trabecular Metal Technology offers a unique solution for patients who might otherwise lose their mobility.", "So with that, I'll now ask Jim to provide further details on the third quarter and our guidance.", "James T. Crines", "Thanks, David. I will review our third quarter performance in greater detail and will then provide an update regarding our full year 2012 guidance.", "Zimmer's total revenues for the third quarter were $1,026,000,000, a 2.5% constant currency increase compared with the third quarter of 2011. Net currency impact for the quarter was negative, decreasing revenues by 3.1% or $31.8 million. Our euro-denominated revenues were the primary driver of the negative impact. Adjusted gross profit margin in the third quarter was 75.1%, consistent with the first and second quarters, but down by 70 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2011. The positive effect of lower foreign currency hedge losses was offset primarily by negative price and excess and obsolescence cost in the quarter.", "The company's R&D expense constituted 5.2% of sales in the quarter. This is lower than the prior year third quarter, but still within our target range of 5% to 6% of revenue. R&D spending benefited from operational efficiencies, as well as a natural decline related to certain large projects that are approaching full commercialization, including PERSONA, the personalized knee system, and the Trabecular Metal Total Ankle.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses were $430 million in the third quarter, a decrease of 3.2%. At 41.9% of sales, SG&A expenses were 110 basis points below prior year, reflecting significant savings from our transformation and operational excellence programs. In line with the prior year's -- prior quarter's guidance, SG&A as a percentage of sales is expected to be approximately 40% for the full year. Special items accounted for $37 million of expense in the quarter. This included costs associated with our distribution and advanced manufacturing transformation initiatives, quality system enhancements and integration costs associated with recent acquisitions.", "Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased to $286.8 million, amounting to an operating margin ratio of 28%. This ratio reflects 120 basis points of improvement relative to the prior year third quarter. This improvement was driven by operational efficiencies in SG&A and R&D. Net interest expense for the quarter totaled $14.5 million, an increase of $2.8 million over the prior year period. This change results from our $550 million senior notes offering in November of 2011. Adjusted net earnings were $202 million for the third quarter, an increase of 2.5% compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 10.6% to $1.15 on 175.3 million average outstanding diluted shares. These adjusted earnings per share are inclusive of approximately $0.06 of share-based compensation. At $1.02, reported diluted earnings per share increased 1% from the prior year third quarter reported EPS of $1.01. Reported diluted earnings per share for the third quarter include special items net of tax.", "Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.9%, which represents an increase of 30 basis points from the third quarter of 2011. Based on the year-to-date geographic mix of earnings and profits, we now anticipate our full year effective tax rate to be between 26% and 27%. Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.3%.", "As indicated in our earnings release, in the quarter, we acquired 1.6 million shares of company stock at a total purchase price of $98 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 5.5 million shares at a total spend of $345.7 million. As of September 30, 2012, approximately $1.15 billion remained authorized under a $1.5 billion repurchase program, which expires at the end of 2014. The company had approximately 173.5 million shares of common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2012, down from 180.4 million shares as of September 30, 2011. Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $345 million, a decrease of 1.6% from $350.6 million in the third quarter of 2011. Day sales outstanding finished the quarter at 72 days, an increase of 1 day over the prior year period. Adjusted inventory days on hand finished the quarter at 350 days, an increase of 2 days over the third quarter of 2011. The increased investment in inventories reflects the pipeline buildout of PERSONA, the personalized knee system, the Trabecular Metal Total Ankle, the second-generation XtraFix External Fixation System, Zimmer's surgical power equipment and Gel-One hyaluronic acid, offset by inventory reductions in our international operating segments.", "Depreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter amounted to $82.7 million. Free cash flow in the third quarter was $281.5 million, $8.4 million higher than the third quarter of 2011. We define free cash flow as operating cash flow less cash outflows for instruments and property, plant and equipment.  Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $64 million, including $36.4 million for instruments and $27.1 million for property, plant and equipment.", "I will now provide an update to our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2012. In our earnings release this morning, we announced that the company is updating its full year sales and EPS guidance. We now expect full year revenues to increase approximately 2% constant currency when compared to 2011. We have adjusted our outlook for the balance of this year in response to our refined expectations for the ramp-up of revenues associated with new product launches, as well as the apparent modest deceleration in musculoskeletal market growth. The company now estimates that foreign currency translation will decrease revenues by approximately 2% for the full year 2012, resulting in flat revenue growth on a reported basis. We expect our gross margin ratio for the full year to be in line with our prior guidance of approximately 75%.", "Taking into consideration our current revenue expectations and line item guidance we have previously provided, full year 2012 adjusted diluting earnings per share are now projected to be in a range of $5.25 to $5.30. This guidance is consistent with the value-creation framework we outlined earlier in the year and that David referenced in his remarks. To arrive at GAAP earnings per share, you should subtract total charges for special items of approximately $135 million pretax or approximately $0.50 per share. Please note that our guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or other unforeseen events.", "Finally, I would like to make a brief comment regarding the medical device excise tax, which is set to go into effect in 2013. Pursuant to the statute, the excise tax is imposed on the first sale in the United States by the manufacturer, producer or importer of a medical device to either a third party or an affiliated distribution entity. Since we distribute the majority of our musculoskeletal products through a distribution entity, the tax generally represents an inventoriable cost for us. As such, we expect the excise tax expense recognized in 2013 to be lower than prior estimates and we'll report the expense in cost of goods sold on the face of our consolidated income statement.", "David, I'll turn the call back over to you.", "David C. Dvorak", "Thank you, Jim. Continued above-market performances in a number of international markets and emerging businesses supported year-over-year sales growth in the third quarter. A substantial amount of this growth was attributable to the new product introductions in existing and adjacent categories across the portfolio. Going forward, we remain on track to increase value for stockholders through the ongoing commercialization of innovative new products, continued progress in our operational excellence programs and disciplined capital deployment.", "And now, I'd like to ask Regina to begin the Q&A portion of our call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", ".", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I guess the first question is on guidance. You had a nice quarter here coming in at 3%, and we're calculating it at 2.6% for the first 9 months. So I wanted to understand, the 2% for the year, does that imply roughly flat to 1% growth in the fourth quarter? And if that's right, can you just talk about what your expectations are for the quarter and if you've seen a slowdown since the third quarter?", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure, Matt. What we're doing is revising the guidance for the year in accordance with what we've seen in the market really through the third quarter, which -- there is some slowdown within the market that's apparent in the large joint side, probably at least 0.5 point, maybe a bit more than that on a global basis. And then in addition to that, just refining our view as we get further along with these product launches is to what the uptick is going to be. So it is a broad range understandably when you frame out the math the way that you do on the downside, but we're being conservative, and we think appropriately conservative relative to the timing and the ramp-up of those products that are being introduced. And the largest of those is the PERSONA knee system. We are about to move forward with the broader release of that system, but we want to get that broad introduction just right at the point of launch. And as a consequence of that timing, any instance that we have to take competitive business, those customers are going to be more interested in moving directly to the PERSONA system than the likelihood of them moving through 2 transitions of knee systems. And so there's a bit of a lull until we move forward, but again, we are absolutely confident that all of these product launches are going to lead to accelerated revenue, and we're being conservative as to our views on the Q4 guidance.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. So is it fair to say that it's more of a timing issue? On a prior call, you had talked about a little bit of a step-up in the fourth quarter leading to some higher growth next year. I guess, you still view these products leading you to higher growth but you may have just a air pocket here.", "David C. Dvorak", "That's exactly right. We absolutely are confident that we're going to see accelerated top line growth, and that may begin in Q4, but we want to be conservative in managing expectations as to when we're going to find that traction point. But it's going to happen, if not in Q4, as we get into 2013.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Bruce Nudell with Credit Suisse.", "Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "You guys did very well in U.S. Hips. There was sluggishness in U.S. Knees. What's that telling us if anything about the status of your kind of sales force adjustments in the United States?", "David C. Dvorak", "Well, I think, Bruce, you're right. We had categories that performed very well within the Americas. We had super performance in Surgical. We had a good performance in Hips, as you point out, within the Americas. More work to do in Knees. But again, as I was just explaining to Matt, Bruce, some of this is a bit of a lull before we move forward with what will be the biggest system launch in the company's history. And we're trying to get those details buttoned down just right and launch that system with absolute precision. So that's going to create that kind of a lull. I think we're weeks or maybe a couple of months away from seeing the traction of that new knee system, and that combined with the effort that we have undergoing to improve our commercial execution in the United States is going to put us in a really good place in the coming quarters.", "Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I guess just to follow up on that point. Should we -- what I was trying to say, I guess, is should we say that the -- should we look at the good performance in Hips, which may have been influenced by Vitamin E, as an indication that you've really made some progress in the U.S. sales force situation? And then my follow-up question really has to do with PERSONA because one of the -- could you just shed any light on how the more natural feel is accomplished? And is it something that could be kind of empirically demonstrated as opposed to kind of a word of mouth? Yes, it does feel better patient by patient.", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure, Bruce. I think on the first question or the first subject, I think we are making progress on the sales force side, but I would tell you that with the portfolio that we have and the products that we're rolling out, there's a lot more opportunity. I think if within our own world you want to score out a performance at a level that is consistent with our expectations, the Europe, Middle East and Africa performance is the one to highlight. They're in almost every product category and almost every country we're in a share-take position. And that's what we're going to strive to in all of our geographic segments. So while we're seeing some improvement in certain areas within the Americas in certain product categories, that needs to be consistent and across the board, and we're going to keep striving until you start to see some of the numbers in the Americas that you're seeing in EMEA relative to market growth rates. The second question on PERSONA, I would tell you that in due time, Bruce, we're going to come back to you and get much, much more granular about the benefits of that system. We're excited about it, but we're going to be disciplined about how we roll that out and how we make the disclosures around the benefits of the system. So bear with us a bit longer.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Unknown Analyst", "This is Robbie in for Bob. Just wanted to know if you could give us a sense of how the Gel-One or power tool launches are going. I know you referenced it in your prepared comments, but how are those launches progressing? And if you could give us a sense of what you think the potential contribution from those products could be over the next 6 to 12 months, that would be great.", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure. And we know Bob gave you this question, so early stages on both of those launches. And there are some staging items until we get to a point where we're fully exploiting those opportunities. I would tell you on the power tools side, the valuation response that we're getting from potential customers is good. There is time between converting those positive evaluations into POs, and so that's progressing. We're very confident that on a global basis, we have a terrific opportunity to penetrate that market, and I think that you probably point out those 2 launches in particular because they're among the examples of new product categories. For us, there's no cannibalization in those categories. And so it's one of the reasons that we're going to see top line acceleration as we find more traction with those launches. So well received on the power tools.  Gel-One, we're just getting going on that in earnest. Obviously, there -- we were in a bit of a holding pattern prior to the completion of the successful patent litigation just a couple, 3 months ago. So it's ramping up, but we're very confident as we get into 2013 with both of those products that we're going to see good results. I don't want to get into characterizing and scoring out the opportunity there yet. But we'll take that comment in mind as we get back on the next quarterly call and we'll try to provide you with some color on the guidance front, okay?", "Unknown Analyst", "Great. And just one more quick follow-up.  Understand the delay in the timing with PERSONA is kind of impacting the U.S. Knee performance. But I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit in more detail about what changes you're making to the business on the sales or operation side to turn around the whole U.S. recon business and get it growing at market rates again. And also, how long do you think that will actually take?", "David C. Dvorak", "I don't think it's going to take us long. There -- it's a territory-by-territory management matter, and that's no different than anywhere else in the world for us. And so we have many territories that are performing very well. And obviously, when you look at that with the same bag of products competing against the same companies, you're looking for that performance to be brought up in areas that are underperforming, relatively speaking. And so that's the work that we're doing. And in instances it requires more investment and instances it requires leadership changes within those territories -- but I think our effort is well underway, and you can see that positive result with some of the product category results that we're delivering at this point in time. More work to do, but that effort that is ongoing along with these product launches are going to come together nicely as we get into 2013. So I think from a timing perspective, you should expect us to put together sequential improvement as we get into 2013. And we're going to keep striving away to try to put numbers on the board again that look like the EMEA performance in this quarter within the Americas. Those are our expectations.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.", "Kimberly Weeks Gailun - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "It's Kim in for Mike. So a question on the sales outlook, and appreciate your comments on the fourth quarter. But you indicated a couple of times on the call that sales growth is expected to improve going forward. Is that something in light of the new product launches that you could frame for us at all going forward? So kind of from sort of flat to 2%, what kind of growth outlook should we be looking for in '13 and beyond?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, please let us do that in the next quarterly call as we give you guidance. I would tell you that the baseline would be the kind of numbers that we're putting on the board at this point in time, and we ought to be accelerating up. And if you take what we were providing in the prior quarter guidance as far as the second half and the ramp-up, I think it's fair to push that out a quarter or 2 and expect us to step up 100 plus basis points from that level. But we're going to frame that out for you much more specifically as we provide you with 2013 guidance.", "Kimberly Weeks Gailun - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Just a follow-up for Jim on the excise tax commentary. Can you explain why you think that's going to be lower now versus the prior expectations, and maybe if you could kind of frame or quantify that piece at least for '13?", "James T. Crines", "Sure, Kim. And we had -- prior to sort of understanding how more precisely the tax would need to be accounted for and we've done some research on this and have gotten technical sort of literature out of the independent accounting firms that tells us that, in our case, as I said, where we -- our first sale of devices is from -- happens within our consolidated group between the manufacturing entity and a distribution entity. The tax is assessed at that point. And as a consequence, the tax initially will be capitalized. We'll be paying tax from the first of the year, but it initially will get capitalized as an inventoriable cost. And if we assume at this stage, and we have more work to do, admittedly, that our inventory turns 2 times a year, what we were estimating before in the order of $40 million to $50 million of expense for the full year, half of that gets deferred. It just gets pushed out 6 months. So at this point -- and as I said we have a bit more work to do, at this point, we'd be estimating an expense that would be roughly half of our prior estimate and then building up to the $40 million to $50 million of expense when we get into 2014. And having it sort of continue to run at that rate off of and growing at in line with sales growth for our U.S. business.", "Operator", "The next question will come from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Jim, I wondered if you could maybe go down the P&L here and talk about leverage. It looks like even based on fourth quarter guidance you're still on pace to deliver perhaps 100 basis points of EBIT leverage, because obviously you had a strong performance for the year. And I just want to take David's comments about needing to reinvest in the U.S. You have a significant number of new products coming heading into '13, so how do we think about the ongoing cost initiatives relative to David's comments about the need to reinvest? And you're talking about reacceleration on the top line. When we think about your strong EBIT performance in this particular year, can we expect similar levels of margin performance in '13?", "James T. Crines", "Let me -- I would just sort of to reflect back on what we communicated earlier this year in the context of our value creation framework, David, where we indicated in an environment where we see an opportunity for top line growth in low to mid-single digits, we're committed to run the business in a way where we deliver somewhere in the order of 8% to 12% growth in earnings per share. We've communicated that with respect to 2013 and EBIT leverage, it gets a bit more challenging to drive the kind of leverage you're seeing this year as we face into the medical device excise tax, which as we -- you know goes into effect in 2013. Now having said that, we now understand that, that tax is not going to be -- that expense is not going to be quite as significant as we -- as the $40 million to $50 million that I referenced in 2013. So that perhaps is going to provide us with some opportunity to invest in 2013 a bit more aggressively, whether it's in the sales channel or product development. But as we develop our operating plans for 2013, we sort of start with an objective that is aligned with those value-creation objectives that I mentioned.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then David, just a quick follow-up for you on sales growth. It sounds like obviously the PERSONA deliberate delay here in the fourth quarter -- maybe delay is the wrong word, is the single biggest reason why maybe there's a slight depression in fourth quarter sales, and that should rebound next year. We've also seen in the last couple of quarters strength outside the U.S. and obviously some sluggishness in the U.S. Is it safe to assume that, that trend should reverse perhaps in the first quarter of '13 when PERSONA begins in earnest?", "David C. Dvorak", "I absolutely believe that in the first quarter of 2013, you're going to see the Americas business improve its performance. And I think that it'll continue to improve its performance sequentially throughout 2013, both by virtue of the commercial improvement efforts that we have undergoing that is to improve our execution within the Americas on the sales side, as well as the ramp-up of the product launches that we've been talking about.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "So your pricing this quarter looks pretty stable, kind of similar to what we've seen, the declines that we've seen in the previous quarter. We have heard from some other companies perhaps a little bit of an optimistic tone. Maybe we're seeing a little bit of improvement in the pricing environment. I was wondering if you were seeing any of that. And kind of related to that, next year now that you will be facing that medical device tax, do you think that you'll be able to use that tax as any sort of leverage to at least maybe stabilize pricing or prevent further pricing declines next year?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, I think that from our perspective, it's a story of stabilization. We've seen very consistent trends in this regard throughout the full year as is evidenced by the fact that we've been within 10 basis points, that's the range, every quarter this year on a consolidated basis for pricing. So I understand the tone is maybe a hint at a more positive environment coming from some of the other competitive calls as they reported out their third quarter results. What we're seeing is stability rather than a reversal of those trends. And I think that in light of that, to carry that through into a belief that perhaps the med device tax is going to be capable of being passed on to customers, that probably is a bit of a leap forward in the pricing context for us at this point in time.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And then as a follow-up, the -- your Total Ankle launch, that's an exciting new launch. It gets you kind of new category for the first time. Can you talk a little bit about what -- whether you have a dedicated sales force that'll be selling that product, how you'll be incorporating that into your sales infrastructure and if you feel you have the infrastructure needed to -- that you need to really launch that product full force?", "David C. Dvorak", "That's a good question. We're very excited about this new product launch, obviously. This is a space that, frankly, is an area that is in need of a better solution, the standard of care being fusion. So the Total Ankle replacement system that we developed incorporates Trabecular Metal Technology. We're very excited about it. And furthermore, the surgical approach with a novel lateral approach is something that we think can be a real difference maker as well. So this is going to be one that we're very methodical at the launch of this system. The training on the technique is crucial. So it'll be a slow walk, a methodical process to get it just right as well. And as a consequence, any need to develop more focus or specialization within the sales force, Derrick, would be layered in as that product launches out. But it really will be the centerpiece and anchor to the beginnings of our lower extremity offering in that space that we look to expand as we broaden our extremities franchise as a whole.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "I wanted to follow up with comments market [Technical Difficulty].", "David C. Dvorak", "Pardon me, Matt. You do sound like you're fading in and out.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay, so I did want to just follow up on one of your earlier comments on the market. Seen a lot of results this quarter and some good, some bad. But I had not heard folks on the ortho or spine [ph] talk of sort of a marked slowdown in the market per se, at least not in the U.S. I wanted to get some color on what it is that you're seeing, where you're seeing it. What do we think is driving the slowdown you mentioned?", "David C. Dvorak", "I think I got the gist of your question, Matt. So let me give you a little bit of perspective. Obviously, it's more difficult for us to give you better insights into the smaller product categories within our portfolio. We, just by virtue of the size of the business and the market share, can probably offer a bit of color in the large joint side. And that's a market that looks to us as though it slowed down sequentially from Q2 to Q3 by something like 0.5 point. And we believe that it was more profound in the case of knees within the United States. We believe that, that slowdown was probably more profound in the case of hips in the o-U.S. market.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay. Any -- and, I guess, any sense of sort of top-down observation? Or has it [ph] picked up any color from your folks in the field about this?", "David C. Dvorak", "No. You get all sorts of anecdotal explanations as to what's happened. And I think that there's no doubt that those summer months, people can speculate about the seasonality and whether or not that's changing. That's really difficult, and you get into a month or 2 of that. And you just need more time to examine whether or not there's a trend to be determined. So I think you just have to get deeper into the fourth quarter to better understand whether or not that's a procedural slowdown that is a blip or a bit longer in its duration. It's part of the reason that we're being conservative about the top line guidance for Q4. I don't think that there's anything fundamental about that in the sense that it's going to be a prolonged period or that this is a sign that the market is changing. I don't believe that at all. And then you can see some specific slowdowns in particular countries within a jurisdiction like our EMEA business. But again in EMEA, we're outperforming the market in a significant enough way to where that isn't affecting our results.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay. And then I wanted to just follow up with a product question. You talked a fair amount about eLIBRA. How does that -- I guess, we have an understanding of how custom cutting blocks or the PSI system benefits the company. If you could maybe talk about what's the revenue model or the benefit stream of eLIBRA. How does that work exactly. Just because it's a relatively new product for us.", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure. So it's incremental cost in the procedure, but the fundamental benefit of the eLIBRA system is it informs the surgeon when they're making their primary cuts, their initial bone cuts both on the femoral and the tibia side as to what that's going to get them by way of soft tissue balancing before they do their AP cuts. So whereas other systems sort of inform the surgeon after they've made all their bone cuts as to what they need to do with regard to soft tissue releases, the eLIBRA system allows the surgeon to have the information while they're in the bone -- the primary bone-cut phase of the procedure. It's integrated into their natural sequence and procedural algorithm. And the feedback information, because it's a sensor technology, allows them to get the bone cuts just right and mitigate the chance that they're going to come to the end of the procedure and have to do soft tissue releases. So when trained up and used properly, this can not only be a system that provides a better answer for the patient, a more natural-feeling knee because the soft tissue balancing is optimized, but it also can be integrated in a way where the surgeon is getting feedback at a point in time where they can become more efficient and avoid re-dos, avoid tweaking the soft tissue with releases at the end of the procedure.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "And then the economics of this, I know you don't want to get into pricing, but is this -- should we think about it as something similar to maybe the premium that you get from PSI per case, something along those lines?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes. That's the right way to think about it. That's the right way.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I just wanted to go back again on this med tech tax and the rationale for why it's in cost of goods sold with the distributors. Is that just simply a function of the network that you guys have set up, just being these independently operated distributors? Because you're the only company so far that has kind of at least talked about putting it into cost of goods sold versus SG&A or even other expenses.", "James T. Crines", "Sure. Kristen, it's not that we have independent distributors. It's that within our consolidated group of companies, we sell from a manufacturing entity to a wholly owned distribution entity. We -- it's a structure we've had in place for many years reinforced frankly by the transformation initiatives that we're executing on where we have as, you may know, established a distribution hub for the U.S. market near Memphis. So it's really that the -- the inventory that leaves the manufacturing entity and is sold really through an affiliated company to the distribution entity is the point at which that tax is getting assessed under the statute. And it's really that, the fact that our supply chain is set up that way that leads us to account for the tax expense as a cost of goods. And this is very consistent with the way in which the excise tax that was imposed in Puerto Rico a couple of years ago was accounted for as well. It's a manufacturer's tax, which is why it ends up being accounted for as an inventory cost.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And I assume it's still tax deductible at the end of the day too?", "James T. Crines", "Yes.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, and so the way to think about it is even though everyone else will start to be accounting for it through their P&L in the first quarter of 2013, you guys won't actually see the impact of the med tech tax running through your P&L until probably more midyear as some of the kind of older inventory works through and until you get some of the newer inventory with this tax kind of built in?", "James T. Crines", "That's right. And I'd be surprised if we were the only company that has the supply chain set up in  that way.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just on project transformation, can you just remind us kind of what the net savings have been this year and kind of what is left in that program to give you confidence to maybe grow double digits, as I think you said in the past, despite I guess the device tax coming in next year, which now is obviously half as much of a headwind?", "James T. Crines", "Sure. So coming into the year, we had talked about the actions that we would be able to get completed this year would generate $80 million of savings on an annualized pretax basis with an expectation that we would realize $30 million to $40 million of that in 2012. We communicated on last quarter's call that the programs are on track. I would tell you they're still, they remain on track. And when you take that $80 million that is generated out of this year's actions and add that on top of the savings that were derived or realized from the actions we took in 2011, we come out of 2012 at a run rate of $130 million to $140 million in total. Now admittedly, some of those savings are being reinvested in the business in the short term, as you know, to accelerate our certain technology and product development programs, a number of which we've touched on, on this call, also to cover some of the short-term dilution that comes with acquisitions. We've done a number of admittedly small but -- acquisitions, but typically, there is some dilution that comes with those acquisitions in the short term. And also continue to build out the channels in our emerging markets and support some of the other investments that we're making in those emerging markets. So that -- the extent to which we need to reinvest those savings is something that we look at in some detail as we go through the operating -- development of our operating plans. We haven't completed that yet for 2013, but we'll have decisions to make around how much of the $130 million to $140 million we can reinvest and how much needs to be dropped through to the bottom line to deliver on the goals that we have with respect to earnings growth. And we are still targeting $400 million in total by 2016 and are on track to hit that target.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Perfect. And then just a quick last one, I guess, since you brought up emerging markets. I was wondering if you could give your perspective on how you're looking at China. I know Medtronic just announced that they were buying a company, orthopedic company there. How do you kind of see your China business shaking out?", "David C. Dvorak", "We are executing a plan that was developed several years ago in China, Kristen. It's a market that we're very focused on. We've had a terrific distribution channel team over there for years and years and then augmented that with the acquisition of Beijing Montagne almost 3 years ago now. And so I think that we have the building blocks of what we want to do at least on the large joint side within China, but it's a market that we're going to continue to make investments in both on the distribution channel and product side and likely as well on the operations side going forward. And we're growing that business at a very attractive rate at this point.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.", "Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I just wanted to clarify, it's been asked on this call a few times, the value creation goal is 8% to 12% EPS growth. Do you still think you can get there in 2013 in light of the lower expense to the medical device tax that you articulated in this call in 2013? And would you be disappointed if the top line growth in 2013 was not higher on a constant currency basis than in 2012?", "David C. Dvorak", "The answer to your first question is absolutely, and the answer to your second question is absolutely.", "Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then in Europe, your results this quarter were very strong, even adjusting for the extra day. Can you talk about the sustainability of that, please?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes. They were very strong, and that team deserves all the credit for generating those results. If you look at the last many quarters, they put terrific numbers on the board. And if you go back a couple of years, all of us were having discussions about what a drag the European business might be to our overall results, anyone within this industry. And that's a commercial team that is finding a way to get to the growth, and where there are natural opportunities because of the market growth rates, they're financed through share gain. So they're doing a terrific job. I would tell you that I have absolute confidence that they're going to be able to continue to grow above market rates. I think that this quarter is a pretty extraordinary accomplishment. I'm not sure that, that level of above-market growth rate is reasonable to expect every quarter. But with the momentum that they have, they're going to continue to do well relative to the market. Some of the ramifications or practicalities of that extraordinary result that they produced in the third quarter is a reason that we're a little bit cautious about our guidance in Q4 in the sense that you're asking them a lot to keep stringing those kinds of quarters together. But we're going to do very well in that European business for the coming quarters and years in my view.", "Operator", "Your final question will come from the line of Michael Matson with Mizuho Securities U.S.A.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "I guess just with regard to the selling days, with 1 less selling day in the U.S., and I guess 1 additional selling day in some of the o-U.S. regions, I assume there was still a net negative impact to your revenue growth just given that the U.S. is so much larger. Is that a fair assessment?", "David C. Dvorak", "It's pretty close to a wash, Michael, on billing days in Q3. I mean, you're right, you lose a day in the Americas, pick up a day in Europe, pick up a bit more than a day in Asia-Pacific. And so the math works out to be essentially a wash within the quarter. And then looking at Q4, Americas is even year-over-year. We pick up part of a day when you average it all out in Asia-Pacific, but we lose 2 days in Europe in Q4, which impacts the growth rates sequentially there.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then can you give us an update on your PSI instruments for your Uni Knee. Are you seeing any traction there? What's the initial uptake and demand for that system look like?", "David C. Dvorak", "That's a good question. We've been pleased with the uptake of PSI for our ZUK product. And we're looking to further develop the application of our intelligent instruments within the Uni space because we think it can be a difference maker. That, in our view, is an underpenetrated market, and in some of the medical training education as well as the intelligent instruments can be a difference maker in allowing more surgeons to take advantage of that solution where the appropriate or the patient presents in an appropriate way. So I would tell you that the uptake of PSI in the context of ZUK has been faster than it was in primaries as a percentage of total procedures that we're involved in. And I think that, that'll be a place where the -- again the total package of technologies within intelligent instruments will be a difference maker going forward.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And can I just squeeze one more in, the Dornoch acquisition? What's the revenue contribution for that or what was the run rate? Can you quantify that?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes. In round numbers, it's a $10 million business at this point in time. And obviously, that's not the point of the acquisition for us. This rounds out our surgical portfolio, puts us in a very competitive position. It's good technology. That's another market that is underpenetrated in the sense that the standard operating procedure within the hospital systems is to red-bag the fluid waste that is developed through these procedures. And so we think that there's a lot of upside within that space. We have a much, much more comprehensive portfolio now than we did a couple of years ago. And so we're looking for big things from that division going forward.", "So I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today and for your continued support for Zimmer.", "We look forward to speaking to you on our fourth quarter conference call at 8 a.m. on January 31, 2013. I'll turn the call back to you, Regina.", "Operator", "Thank you again for participating in today's conference call.

Mr. Marshall, you may begin your call.", "Robert J. Marshall", "Thanks, Regina. Good morning, and welcome to Zimmer's Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. I'm here with our CEO, David Dvorak; and our CFO, Jim Crines.", "Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.", "Also the discussions during this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included within the earnings release, which is available on our website at investor.zimmer.com.", "With that, I'll now turn the call over to David Dvorak. David?", "David C. Dvorak", "Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. We're glad you've joined us on the call today. This morning, I'll review our fourth quarter and full year 2012 financial results, providing commentary on Zimmer's performance. Jim will then provide additional financial details as well as our 2013 guidance. I'll state all sales in constant currency terms, and I'll discuss all earnings results on an adjusted basis.", "Throughout 2012, Zimmer successfully executed on our value creation agenda, including innovation and growth initiatives, global transformation programs and capital allocation strategies. For the fourth quarter and full year, Zimmer delivered on our financial commitments, generating double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share and significant operating margin improvements. We also achieved key regulatory and commercialization milestones for a number of innovative products and technologies, both in our core franchises and in new adjacent musculoskeletal markets.", "Consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter were $1.18 billion, an increase of 2.1%, and our earnings per share were $1.51, an increase of 11% over the prior year period. Full year 2012 sales were $4.47 billion, an increase of 2.3%, and our full year earnings per share were $5.30, an increase of 10.4% over the prior year. Compared to fourth quarter of 2011, Americas sales grew 3.6% while Europe, Middle East and Africa recorded a sales decline of 0.7% and Asia Pacific delivered growth of 1.8%.", "In the United States, our commercial excellence efforts are focused on raising the performance of certain sales territories to the level of the many others that are continuing to perform well. We're making progress in this arena, contributing to an improved performance in the fourth quarter of nearly 400 basis points. We will build upon these programs and this progress in 2013 through our ongoing commercial excellence efforts and new product launches.", "Notwithstanding the impact of 2 fewer billing days on fourth quarter results, our Europe, Middle East and Africa segment recorded a noteworthy performance for the full year. Elsewhere, we continue to benefit from our global footprint, with strong performances in the quarter and throughout 2012 in many of our targeted emerging markets.", "Turning now to the results of our product categories. Knee sales for the fourth quarter increased year-over-year 0.9%, reflecting positive volume and mix of 3.0% and negative price of 2.1%. In the quarter, our Americas segment reported an increase of 0.4%, while Europe, Middle East and Africa sales were flat and the Asia Pacific region delivered 4.0% growth compared with the prior year.", "A number of exciting milestones were achieved in the quarter for our knee business. Most significantly, we began to expand the release of our new knee offering, Persona, The Personalized Knee System. Building on the clinical legacy of our NexGen and Natural-Knee systems, Persona provides surgeons with unprecedented options to personalize each patient's treatment.", "The fundamental design principle behind this differentiated system is to achieve the forgotten knee by improving fit, feel and function for a more natural feeling knee. The system also incorporates major advances in instrumentation and surgical kitting, supporting more streamlined procedures and providing a number of efficiency benefits to hospitals. Launching a system of this magnitude will involve multiple stages over the next several years. However, we're confident that Persona will begin to contribute to improved performance globally in knees throughout 2013 as more instrument sets are deployed.", "Also in the quarter, iASSIST Knee, the Personalized Guidance System, received FDA clearance. iASSIST is a leading component of our intelligent instruments portfolio, and we're very enthusiastic about the potential of this platform technology. iASSIST delivers on the promise of accurate implant positioning and alignment validation without the complexity associated with costly competitive navigation and robotic systems. Finally, late in the quarter, we received FDA clearance for the Zimmer Unicompartmental Knee System with our new VIVACIT-E Vitamin E advanced bearing technology, extending the application of this proprietary material into the growing partial knee market.", "Hip sales in the fourth quarter decreased 1.2%, reflecting positive volume and mix of 1.8% and negative price of 3.0%. These results included 1.8% growth in the Americas, a 5.2% sales decline in Europe, Middle East and Africa, and a 0.3% decline in Asia Pacific compared with prior year. Zimmer's hip business remains focused on our proprietary technology platforms, including Trabecular Metal Technology and VIVACIT-E Vitamin E advanced bearing material. Products incorporating these premium priced technologies, including the Continuum Cup, delivered encouraging sales in the quarter. We also recorded growth for ceramic products, including the Maxera Cup, Zimmer's large-head, ceramic-on-ceramic option for younger and more active patients, which is currently available in the European markets.", "In the fourth quarter, Extremities sales improved 7.5%. We continue to generate strong sales of our Trabecular Metal Reverse Shoulder System, Trabecular Metal Humeral Stem and our recently introduced Sidus Stem-Free Shoulder System. Our Extremities pipeline is focused on new anatomical sites and segments for the company. In particular, we've been receiving positive clinical feedback from the developer release of our Trabecular Metal Total Ankle Replacement System. This exciting new system supports an innovative lateral surgical approach and provides us with an entry into the lower extremities market.", "Our dental business recorded a sales decrease of 2.3% in the fourth quarter. In a number of international markets, we experienced slower growth consistent with challenging market conditions. However, Trabecular Metal Dental Implants continued to gain traction globally in the quarter. Late in 2012, we also completed the licensing of our U.S. milling center for Zfx digital dentistry solutions. Moving into 2013, we look forward to the benefits of this center supporting our expanded CAD/CAM offerings.", "Trauma sales in the fourth quarter were up 9.7% over the prior year period, with all 3 geographic segments again contributing above market sales growth. These results were supported by strong sales of our anatomically designed Zimmer Natural Nail family and the NCB Periprosthetic Plating System. We also are benefiting from increased penetration of our XtraFix External Fixation System, which now offers MRI compatibility.", "In the fourth quarter, Zimmer's spine business reported a sales decrease of 4.7%. To increase the competitiveness of this business, we're pursuing a strategic focus on innovation and core fusion technologies. Reflecting this focus, we continued to grow sales of recently introduced core fusion products in the quarter, including the Trabecular Metal Ardis Interbody and the TM-S systems.", "Zimmer's surgical and other business category delivered impressive 18.9% sales growth over the prior year period. This business continued to gain share in the quarter, notably in bone cement and tourniquets. Sales of Zimmer surgical power equipment and the recently acquired Transposal waste fluid management system also are beginning to contribute to growth.", "Finally, we continue to make progress building out our early intervention portfolio of products. These products extend our reach into joint preservation earlier in the continuum of care for arthritis and specifically, knee arthritis. In the fourth quarter, we began the broader introduction of our Gel-One hyaluronic acid injection product to promising early feedback.", "Turning now from our product category results, I'd like to provide some additional thoughts on Zimmer's strategic growth initiatives. In 2012, Zimmer once again delivered against our financial commitments, but perhaps our most significant accomplishments related to product and technology innovation. Throughout the year and especially in the fourth quarter, we advanced a number of clinically differentiated new offerings through regulatory clearance and the initial stages of commercialization. While the achievement of many of these innovation milestones has yet to contribute materially to our results, we're confident that our new products and technologies will drive accelerated top line growth in 2013. These offerings represent the culmination of significant R&D investments and are indicative of our continuing cycle of innovation. A number of these products address new anatomical sites for the company or are in adjacent segments in which we had not previously competed, generating incremental revenues.", "Our innovation pipeline remains focused on improving clinical outcomes through greater personalization to match the needs of each unique patient, as well as increased efficiency and reproducibility through intelligent instrumentation and preoperative planning tools. We believe our pipeline offers a significant value proposition for all stakeholders, including surgeons, their patients and health care systems.", "I'll now turn the call over to Jim, who will provide further details on the quarter and our guidance. Jim?", "James T. Crines", "As David discussed, our total revenues for the fourth quarter were $1,181,000,000, a 2.1% constant currency increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Net currency impact for the quarter was negative, decreasing revenues by an additional 1% or $11 million. The negative currency impact for the quarter related principally to our euro and Japanese yen denominated revenues and was partially offset by positive currency impact from our Canadian and Australian dollar revenues.", "Continuing the trend of the last several quarters and in line with our expectations, Zimmer experienced pricing pressure of negative 1.9% in the quarter. In the United States, large joint reconstructive pricing improved by roughly 50 basis points in the fourth quarter, but this improvement was offset by incremental pressure in certain key European markets as we anticipated.", "Our adjusted gross profit margin was 74.9% for the quarter. The margin ratio improved 70 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. The primary drivers of this improvement were lower manufacturing costs and reduced losses on foreign currency hedge contracts, partially offset by lower average selling prices. In the quarter, we continued to benefit from progress in our strategic sourcing and manufacturing optimization transformation programs. Specifically, we are implementing leaner and more standardized processes of manufacturing, which are driving greater efficiency and lower unit costs.", "R&D expense decreased 14.8% on a reported basis when compared to the prior year. The step-down in R&D expense for the quarter reflects a natural decline related to the completion of certain large projects as well as the benefit of changes we have made in this function to increase efficiencies.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses were $461 million in the fourth quarter and at 39% of sales were 60 basis points below prior year. Changes stemming from our transformation initiatives drove improvement in SG&A, allowing us to absorb the costs associated with the commercialization of a range of new products, including promotion and medical education costs.", "Special items amounted to $54.3 million in the quarter. We increased our provision for certain claims by $15 million in the fourth quarter. We also recorded a noncash charge for goodwill impairment of $96 million net of tax related to our U.S. spine reporting unit. The change in outlook for the U.S. spine market, together with ongoing company-specific challenges, contributed to the decrease in the implied fair value of our U.S. spine business.", "Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to $368.1 million. At 31.2%, our adjusted operating profit to sales ratio was 220 basis points higher than the prior year fourth quarter, primarily driven by lower operating expenses. Our fourth quarter and full year operating profit margins of 31.2% and 29.5%, respectively, demonstrate great progress in the execution of our value creation agenda.", "Net interest expense for the quarter amounted to $14 million compared to $12.7 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted net earnings were $263.5 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 7.6% compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 11% to $1.51 on 174.1 million average outstanding diluted shares. These adjusted earnings per share are inclusive of approximately $0.05 of share-based compensation. At $0.88, reported diluted earnings per share increased 1% over the prior year fourth quarter reported EPS of $0.87.", "Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.7%, and our full year 2012 adjusted tax rate was 26.2%. This is slightly above prior year and of course, excludes the extension of the R&D and other tax credits, which were enacted by Congress in January. These credits, as they pertain to the 2012 calendar year, amount to approximately $4 million and will be reflected in our first quarter 2013 results. Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.3%, and our full year reported tax rate was 24%. The rates for the quarter and the full year reflect the net benefit to income taxes of $34 million, which is excluded from our non-GAAP adjusted earnings measure. The benefit pertains to a legal entity restructuring of certain international operations.", "During the quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares at a total purchase price of $140 million. For the full year 2012, we utilized our repurchase program to reclaim 4.3% of the company's issued and outstanding common stock, enabling us to return increased value to stockholders. Approximately $1 billion of authorization remains under our repurchase program that runs through December 31, 2014. The company had approximately 172 million shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2012, down from 178 million as of December 31, 2011.", "Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $368 million, a decrease of 6.4% from $393 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. This reflects a higher level of inventory investments in the current year quarter ahead of an anticipated ramp-up in revenue from a number of new products in 2013. Net inventories were $995 million at the end of the fourth quarter, an increase of $65 million from the fourth quarter of the prior year. Adjusted inventory days on hand finished the quarter at 301 days, an increase of 24 days compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, reflecting the ongoing commercialization of a number of new product systems including Persona, The Personalized Knee System; the Trabecular Metal Total Ankle; the second-generation XtraFix External Fixation System; Zimmer surgical power equipment; and Gel-One hyaluronic acid.", "As of year end 2012, net receivables increased to $885 million from $839 million in 2011 or 5% over prior year. Our adjusted trade accounts receivable days sales outstanding finished the quarter at 64 days, flat to the fourth quarter of 2011. Depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter amounted to $90.3 million.", "Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was $281 million, $40 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2011. We define free cash flow as operating cash flow less cash outlays for instruments and property, plant and equipment. The decrease in free cash flow reflects the increased investments in inventory and instruments necessary to support the full release of Persona and the other new products referenced in my comments on inventory.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $87.5 million, including $44.2 million for instruments and $43.3 million for property, plant and equipment. Cash outlays associated with investing activities during the quarter include $20 million for acquisitions.", "And now I'd like to turn to our guidance for 2013. In our earnings release this morning, we announced that the company expects full year revenues to increase between 2.5% and 4.5% in constant currency when compared to 2012. At this time, assuming currency rates remain at year-end 2012 levels, we anticipate foreign currency translation will decrease our reported 2013 revenues by an estimated 0.5%. Therefore, on a reported basis, our revenues are projected to be between 2% and 4% above 2012 results.", "Among our forward-looking assumptions for 2013, we believe that full year knee and hip markets will grow in the low single digits. We expect global market conditions will remain relatively stable in 2013. We will have 2 fewer billing days in the first quarter of 2013 in key markets, including our largest market, the U.S. We also anticipate more modest contribution from new products in the first quarter relative to the balance of the year. Consequently, our revenues for the first quarter are expected to be flat to slightly positive on a constant currency basis and slightly negative to flat on a reported basis when compared to the first quarter of the prior year. The 2 fewer billing days in the first quarter in the U.S. will be recovered in the second and third quarters, with 1 higher billing day in each compared to the relevant prior year quarter.", "With regard to pricing for 2013, we assume stable but declining price as we anniversary out of Japanese price adjustments in the second quarter and anticipate moderately weaker pricing in Europe. In the aggregate, this leads us to expect pricing for 2013 to be at or near minus 2% compared with 2012.", "Moving down the income statements. Assuming currency rates remain at recent levels, we expect our gross margin ratio to be between 74.5% and 75.5% for the full year. This takes into account lower anticipated losses on foreign currency hedges as well as the impact of the medical device excise tax, which will be recorded as a cost of sale. As previously reported, we have determined that the excise tax is an inventoriable cost. As such, we expect very little impact on gross profit margins in the first half of the year, although there will be a negative impact on cash flows. Beginning with the third quarter, we anticipate the tax alone will result in approximately $10 million to $15 million of charges in cost of sales on a quarterly basis.", "We expect R&D expense for the year to average approximately 5% of sales. Although we are cycling out of several major product development projects, our pipeline remains robust. Changes we have made to increase the productivity and process efficiency of our R&D function enable us to more effectively focus investments in this area while still supporting the vitality of our pipeline.", "SG&A is expected to be between 39.5% and 40% of sales for the year as we realize operational efficiencies from our global transformation initiatives and further leverage revenue growth. Assuming variable rates remain at recent levels, we expect interest and other expense of around $60 million in 2013. We anticipate a 2013 full year adjusted effective tax rate between 26.5% and 27%, which is higher than our final rate for 2012. This projected increase is primarily due to a larger proportion of our earnings and profits anticipated from higher-tax jurisdictions in 2013.", "We anticipate the diluted weighted average shares outstanding for 2013 to be approximately 170 million shares. Therefore, 2013 full year adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be in the range of $5.65 to $5.85. Taking into account the impact of 2 fewer billing days and other factors, first quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.42.", "As indicated in our release, we expect to record pretax charges of $120 million to $130 million within the 2013 operating period related to transformation initiatives. The programs to be completed in 2013 are expected to generate annualized pretax savings of $80 million, including $30 million to $40 million to be realized in 2013. We continue to make meaningful progress in our business transformation efforts, which include strategic sourcing, streamlined logistics, shared services and the implementation of leaner manufacturing operations, and we remain on track to deliver our aspirational goal of $400 million in savings by 2016.", "Returning to 2013 guidance. We also expect to incur an additional $5 million to $15 million for certain acquisition and integration costs connected with the acquisition of third-party distributors in the recently completed acquisitions of Exopro, Dornoch and Zfx. Therefore, to arrive at our anticipated reported GAAP earnings per share, you should subtract total charges for special items of $135 million pretax or approximately $0.60 per share.", "Turning to cash flow. We anticipate total capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $240 million to $280 million. Instrument capital is expected to be in the range of $125 million to $145 million. Traditional PP&E is expected be in the range of $115 million to $135 million, reflecting the cash outlays necessary to drive new product development and commercialization activities. Our guidance assumes that we will continue to return cash to our stockholders through our share repurchase and dividend programs. Free cash flow in excess of these capital allocation programs is assumed to be held in cash and cash equivalents or other investments. Estimated depreciation and amortization expense for the year is in the range of $370 million to $380 million. Finally, please note that our guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or other unforeseen events.", "David, I'll turn the call back over to you.", "David C. Dvorak", "Thanks, Jim. Zimmer is well positioned to deliver high single to double-digit earnings growth in 2013 through continued expansion in both established and emerging markets and through the savings delivered by our operational and commercial transformation programs. We look forward to the broader introduction of an unprecedented pipeline of new products and systems in our core franchises and in a number of adjacent product categories, delivering new opportunities for expanded top line growth.", "And now I'd like to ask Regina to begin the Q&A portion of our call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "I just wanted to start with guidance here. You've talked about previously EPS growth in the 8% to 12% range as kind of something sustainable, a sustainable target for you. Your guidance for next year, I think, gets us to kind of a 6.5% to 10% range. Can you just talk about sort of where the difference between sort of that aspirational goal and what you're setting for next year and how you see that sort of increasing to your aspirational goals?", "James T. Crines", "Sure. We have also said, Derrick, all along that 2013 did not provide the same kind of opportunity for operating leverage as other years since, as you very well know, we are in a position in 2013 to have to absorb the medical device excise tax. We've done that, and I would reflect -- I would focus on the fact that the midpoint of that range is certainly well within the aspirational targets that we've discussed. And I'd also reflect on the fact that when you look at our guidance, and particularly when you look at the detailed guidance that I provided on the various operating expense line, in terms of what's implied in operating profit growth, we are still driving leverage in 2013 as a result of the progress that we're making on the transformational agenda and behind the anticipated growth we look to achieve with the launch of all these new products that David mentioned.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. On -- and turning to the hip and knee markets, it looks like you did see a bit of an acceleration in your Americas knee sales, kind of consistent with what we've seen from some of the other companies that have reported. In the U.S. or in Americas, your hip sales kind of stayed flat, whereas I think we saw a bit of an acceleration from the other larger competitors. So I was wondering if you could comment, first, kind of broadly on sort of how you're seeing kind of the market dynamics in hips and knees unfold this quarter. In particular, there's been some questions around are we seeing a bit of a pull-forward in procedures in Q4 as a result of some of the kind of concerns around fiscal cliff, et cetera, by patients. And then in particular then, could you comment on your own performance relative to kind of your competitors and maybe the lack of acceleration that you're seeing in hips and maybe talk about what's driving the improvement in your knee sales.", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure. I think that when it comes to the overall market, we did see a bit of a pickup sequentially from Q3 to Q4. But the pickup was more in the United States and offset by some o U.S. markets that actually stepped down, notably some of the European markets. So I would deem it, Derrick, to be a stable market for large joints. If you look across the quarters of 2012, you have a range of maybe 150 basis points from the highest growth rate quarter to the slowest growth rate quarter. And the average for the year looks to me to be dead on with what we saw in Q4, that is around 2% growth. I think our own performance, we've talked about the improvement that we want to drive within the U.S. market. We're seeing improvement. I think that we had a nice pickup sequentially from Q3 to Q4, but more work to do in that regard. And I think that the programs that we're executing along with these new product launches are going to put us in a really nice place as 2013 progresses.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "And are you seeing any evidence of a pull-forward in procedures, at least in the U.S. in Q4, kind of based on increased seasonality at all?", "David C. Dvorak", "I don't. I don't think that there's anything that is noticeable in that regard or noteworthy in that regard. I think that we always see seasonality, and you're going to have some puts and takes across the globe. And for us, we look at that. And again, in the United States, saw a bit of a pickup; in the European markets, saw a bit of a slowdown as we got to the back half of the year, certainly into the fourth quarter within the European markets. So when it washes out, you end up with a market that is stable.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So I'm sure there will be a lot of questions about hips and knees, but I want to focus on the surgical and other line because obviously, this quarter you saw a pickup in your growth rate of roughly 2x, which you've been growing in the last couple of quarters. And I wanted to make sure, for my first question, that I had a good understanding of what drove that acceleration in that line item this quarter. Was that truly the first signs of positive feedback on your power tool launch? Or were there other more onetime items in there?", "David C. Dvorak", "Well, there was a bit of benefit from the acquisition of Dornoch's Transposal waste fluid management system, but the growth is much, much broader than that. So we did a nice job on the legacy products, Bob, within the surgical portfolio and just are beginning to see some of the benefits of power tools and the new product categories. And it's just -- it's a good area for us to focus on because we've been talking a lot about the new products, both through internal and external development. And the surgical line is an area where we've shored up our legacy products with internal innovation efforts but we've also added through external development, and that allows us to now penetrate markets that we didn't previously participate in. So I think that's going to be a big theme for us in 2013 as we add products into categories and markets in which -- and these are adjacencies, so these aren't out of our core wheelhouse here. These are within the markets that we serve and the relationships that we possess. As we add those new product categories, those are going to be top line growth accelerators, and that's exactly what you saw in Q4 within our surgical line.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So then just to follow up on that. As it relates to that line item for 2013, some of these new products have been on the market for 6 months now or so. And you're saying we probably won't see much of a pickup in Q1. I guess I'm wondering why we wouldn't start to see that. And then implicit in your guidance for revenues, what sort of contribution are you assuming from, say, hyaluronic acid and power tools? I think it'd probably be a safe assumption, from my perspective, that you could grab at least 5% of those markets in 2013. And I was wondering if you -- is that what you're assuming? Or just any further color on that would be helpful.", "David C. Dvorak", "Well, those are -- it is the case that we're moving into full release of many of these products, Bob, and they're going to come at different paces, right. There are going to be instances like Gel-One where I have absolute confidence that in a reasonable time period, we're going to pick up nice market share with that product. All the initial feedback has been very, very positive, and we have to get all the distribution channel elements set up, so that includes the specialty pharma wholesale side. We've got the buy and bill side. We're pushing hard on that. But it's going to be a ramp-up because it is a new product category. When it comes to the implant systems, as you know, you're deploying instrument sets. That takes time. The surgeon training and education takes time. And so it will ramp up sequentially. And I think that the biggest thing that you have to recognize in Q1 is 2 less billing days in our largest market. That's several hundred basis points. So we're going to make progress in executing these launches. I think that you'll start to see that progress much more in Q2 and thereafter in 2013.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And do you assume that line item grows 15% to 20% this year?", "David C. Dvorak", "Within surgical?", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Within the surgical and other, yes.", "David C. Dvorak", "Surgical and other, we expect to see double-digit growth within that line.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I just wanted to ask one on knees and maybe just help us gauge the ramp of the Persona launch this year. And also just a broader question on hips, what can you do there to improve some of your hip performance? How big of a contributor do you expect some of these new cups to be in 2013?", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure. I think on the knee front, the Persona, The Personalized Knee System, is going to be the company's largest launch ever, and we put a lot of effort into the development of this system. It's a multigenerational product development effort. It will be rolled out in phases literally over multiple operating periods. And so 2013 is just the beginning. But within 2013, we expect this system to make a meaningful difference in our knee performance. And so we feel terrific about where we're headed within total knee arthroplasty, which is obviously our largest franchise. I would tell you that we feel very good about our pre-TKA offerings and our revision offerings as well, the latter leveraging Trabecular Metal, the former leveraging terrific clinical results with our Unicompartmental System and now adding Vitamin E as a bearing surface that is a superior technology, puts us in a great, great place. So there's going to be more to talk about with Persona in the coming quarters as we roll out the elements of that system. It's a very comprehensive system that, as I said, includes the implant designs that offer terrific fidelity and personalization options for the surgeon. We believe that it will be unmatched in the marketplace. And we're also augmenting that with advanced technologies through our intelligent instrumentation offering that will include iASSIST. So we're expecting big things from our knee franchise and are very confident that we're going to be able to deliver. On the hip side, we have a very solid line already. We have some great innovations and again, Vitamin E is something worth talking about there, intelligent instrument innovations on the way within that franchise and shoring up our Revision line as well. So I think that hips is going to be a good contributor for us as well. We're probably a little bit phased behind where we are in knees on the innovations with new things coming out. But with the Continuum Cup and our existing lineup of cups and stems and various bearing surfaces, we feel like we're in a great position to compete effectively in hips currently.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And I just wanted to ask one on China because clearly, there's been some deals in this space. You had one that you did a couple of years ago and haven't talked much about it. So I was curious in terms of how much of a contributor to performance China has been for you, and how you expect that to grow over time?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, China's performed very well. I think that it's one of the key markets that we're focused on within the emerging market set. We, some time ago, as you mentioned, did a relatively small acquisition there, but I think an intelligent acquisition for us to penetrate beyond the premium market segment there, premium -- and a little bit more of a value mid-market segment. That acquisition's gone well for us. That was the Beijing Montagne acquisition. It brought us some products. It brought us local capabilities on research and development manufacturing as well as a distribution channel that was set up focused on that market. All of those key emerging markets continue to grow double digits plus for us, and we expect to see that kind of continued progress in China and elsewhere.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Bruce Nudell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Dave, like when we calculated the hip and knee major joint market for the year, we came up with like 2.5%. And your -- this quarter, your non-major joint businesses, I think, were growing around 7%. So if you kind of grow at market in major joints next year assuming constancy and show continued momentum in the other businesses that you have, you should be kind of at the higher end of the revenue guidance range. And so could you just elaborate on your thinking of what's going to influence where you wind up in that range? Any assumptions you may have about maybe continued underperformance in major joints as offset by strength in the non-major joint businesses? And is the midpoint of the range what we should be thinking about?", "David C. Dvorak", "In direct answer to your question, I think that the last question you pose, Bruce, is -- the answer to that is, yes, I think that is the right place to start the year. And the comments that you started with, I think are the locker room comments that will go up in front of our sales force because it really is -- it's a sales execution game for us at this point in time. And it's a matter of not whether, but how fast we'll be able to ramp up and exploit the opportunities of these terrific new products that are getting launched across the globe and across all the product categories. We've never been in a better position. So the pace of that, whether it's one quarter or another quarter where you start to find some traction, you can never predict with absolute certainty. You can run into some extra training needs or resource shifts to be able to fully exploit those opportunities. And so of course, you're going to come into this year providing a range, but I'm really excited about where we're headed. We'll withstand the couple billing day loss of Q1, make good progress in the initial stages of these launches. And I think that thereafter, you're going to start to see progress on the large joint side and as well, we have some great opportunities in some of the other product categories as you referred to them.", "Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "So just to put a finer point on it. You wouldn't be shocked at 3.5% to 4% as opposed to 2.5% to 3%. So we shouldn't be ruling out maybe a little better than midpoint?", "David C. Dvorak", "I'm not going to rule it out, Bruce, but we provide you with a broad guidance here, sitting on a cold winter day in January, because it's the first month of the year. So look, we're going to run the business, and our expectations obviously are all that and more. But we want to make sure that we're expense focused on the management side, and we're doing the right things to manage expectations with all of you.", "Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Fair enough. And I'm just going to try to hold you to the promise you made last quarter, I think. Could you just give us a little color on how you scale the Gel-One opportunity, which does look like a very interesting product?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes. This is -- it is a product that we're going to do well with. Again, very confident to that. We're just getting rolling. Obviously, if a company had an HA product in that space and had the full channel build out, the penetration rate that you're going to get to in the early quarters is going to be a bit higher. Some of that infrastructure and distribution channel needs to get built out, and we're in the process of doing it. I think we're making great progress on it. So again, this is something where whether it's 1 quarter or 2 quarters or 3 quarters, we know we have a great opportunity. We're going to be methodical in our approach to it, be smart about showing that we're doing it the right way for the long term. But we've got some people that are very enthusiastic about it and we're going to get after it. I don't really want to get into breaking out one product category, Bruce, and providing specific millions of dollars guidance on that. But it's embedded within our 2.5% to 4.5% constant currency growth rate guidance for the full year.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.", "Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I wanted to start with the gross margin and then ask a question on Persona. So Jim, help us out here. If the medical device tax is about a 70 basis point hit, it looks like you're expecting an improvement in the underlying gross margin year-over-year, if I'm doing the math correctly. So first, am I doing the math correctly? And if so, what's driving the improvement in the gross margin in 2013?", "James T. Crines", "Sure. So again, we anticipate our gross margin ratio will be between 74.5% and 75.5% for the full year. That -- I think that lines up very close to where we landed for the full year 2012. And among -- ahead of things that are going to be impacting on margin in 2013, we expect the positive trend in hedge gains and losses to continue throughout 2013. We also anticipate lower unit cost from a combination of higher volumes associated with new products, with the Persona launch being the key driver, as well as efficiencies gained and expect to continue to gain from improvements in our manufacturing processes. So just to give you some idea of the change, changes in hedge contract gains and losses alone using year-end exchange rates account for about a 50 to 60 basis point improvement in 2013 compared to 2012. And as you pointed out, offsetting the favorability in hedge gains and losses and the reductions in unit costs will be the anticipated 2% decline in average selling prices, and in the second half of the year, the $10 million to $15 million per quarter charge in cost of sales for the medical device excise tax.", "Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And then on Persona, what can we expect at AAOS this year? And can you give us a little bit of color on the o U.S. launch timing? And just lastly, do you think Persona is mainly going to be a mix benefit for you guys? Or do you think that the advantages of the system will be enough to take market share, which has obviously been very, very sticky in the hip and knee market?", "David C. Dvorak", "Good questions, and we will be in a position to provide you with more exposure to the Persona system at the Academy. So hope you're able to make it. The launch of the system is a global launch. But I would tell you that as is consistent with most of these launches within the industry, we're focused more so on the United States initially and then key o U.S. markets. So the big opportunities in year 1 are going to be more U.S. oriented. And I see it as being a system that provides us with opportunities beyond mix even out of the gate. As you said, those are harder because of the stickiness of the market share. But the benefits of the system are profound enough to where we believe we're going to have competitive opportunities even in year 1.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Can we touch a little bit upon your U.S. sales force? It looks like your Americas revenue growth is accelerating actually quite nicely. And is there any reflection in sales effort or realignment of that effort?", "David C. Dvorak", "Well, yes, Joanne, and we mentioned this in the prior quarter 2 calls. We've made adjustments. But that's the case. That's an ongoing management matter, and we're always looking to add talented people to the organization, whether it's at the rep management or senior leadership levels. We've done so over the course of 2012. We'll continue to do so in 2013. I think that we were specific in past quarters about some underperforming territories within the United States. We've made some changes there, starting to see the early signs of those benefits. And so the Q4 performance and the uptick, I think it was a bit, just a bit under 400 basis points, is part of the benefit of the actions that we've taken and the effort that we've made to shore up our execution on the commercial side within the United States. But we would expect to continue to make progress in that regard. And those efforts, combined with the new product launches, ought to put us in a very nice position as 2013 progresses.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "And then the companion to that is, what helps turn your o U.S. sales around?", "James T. Crines", "Well, again, I'd focus, Joanne, on the fact that we had 2 fewer billing days in Europe in the fourth quarter. So if you look at Europe for the full year, I would tell you that we had an outstanding year in what is admittedly a tough market. We -- if you look at our Asia Pacific results for the year and feel that we had a good year relative to the market. As you know, as we get into 2013, at least with respect to Asia Pacific, we'll anniversary out of the Japan price cuts beginning in the second quarter. So that should provide a bit of a tailwind with respect to that region. And we expect to continue to see positive results out of Europe relative to market. So the market may be affected by economic conditions there, but we would expect to continue to see good performance out of our team.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just a couple clarification items. Jim, could you just give us the contribution from acquisitions in the quarter?", "James T. Crines", "On the top line, Mike?", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes, top line.", "James T. Crines", "I don't have a specific percentage. Clearly, there was -- it contributed to the growth that, particularly in that surgical and other products category that David mentioned, the waste management disposal devices contributing in a meaningful way in the quarter.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "How much did Dornoch contribute in the quarter's sense for that line?", "David C. Dvorak", "It would have been low-single digits in millions, Mike. So the contribution on the top line growth of any of those acquisitions is negligible.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes, they're all a bunch of like $2 million to $3 million basically...", "James T. Crines", "That's right, very small businesses that we acquired.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And so -- and the math for the 2.5% to 4.5% for 2013, do you know what it is within that?", "James T. Crines", "Again, these are businesses that when they were acquired had perhaps somewhere in the order of $10 million of revenue, for example, in the case of Dornoch. So obviously more than that in 2013, but it's at the margin. It's going to be -- certainly going to be building that up over time, but not tens of millions in a single operating period from where...", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Understood. When you did your planning for '13, are you essentially assuming that a recon market that is identical to 2012? How are you modeling in?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, that is our assumption, Mike, is that it's stable relative to what we saw in 2012.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And does your performance relative to it improves and you get the contribution from some of the other categories that you're just getting into, right?", "David C. Dvorak", "Both, that's right. And our performance relative to that market will improve sequentially as the year progresses.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then last thing, the distributor buy-ins, how do we think about the impact of that on the business? There's both a plus and a minus from that. So just give us a sense of where you are with that and the impact on the business kind of fourth quarter and rolling into '13.", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, not a significant contribution in that regard either. Those are strategic acquisitions primarily in the o U.S. markets, Mike, where we have an interest in having a presence and making further investments. And so it's a structural adjustment consistent with what we want to do in those particular markets. But we don't have enough going on in that category at this point in time to spend much time talking about it. It just isn't significant.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just maybe a quick one for Jim and then for David as well. Jim, I was looking at the EBIT margin for the third quarter. You had a really nice sequential uptick, and I think 31% is the strongest EBIT you've had in over 4 years. So it does look like the restructuring program is having a benefit. As I think about '13, it seems like we're getting into the back half of the restructuring program, or maybe it's sort of the breakpoint over that 5-year plan. So it seems like you'd start to see more material benefit from restructuring in '13, but that's not necessarily implicit in the guidance you provided for '13. So give us a sense of where you are in the restructuring plan. And is there -- are there more material offsets to the restructuring in '13 that we're not thinking about? Or you think the margin outlook for '13 reflects some conservatism?", "James T. Crines", "Well, first of all, as you said, the work we've completed to date validates our beginning assumption that we can create a lot of value through these programs, the focus of the organization on achieving what we're referring to as operational excellence. We're pretty far along, as you pointed out, but -- and we're on track to achieve the aspirational goal of $400 million of cost savings by 2016. More specifically, I can tell you, on a run-rate basis, when the savings from 2011 and 2012 and the 2012 initiatives are added to the anticipated 2013 savings, we expect the total run rate coming out of the end of the year of $210 million to $220 million. So I will say with respect to how it's impacting on EBIT margins in 2013, first of all, obviously we have to use those savings to absorb the medical device excise tax. But we're also using those savings to accelerate certain technology and product development programs, to cover short-term dilution from these recently completed acquisitions and to support the continuing build-out of our emerging market businesses and to fund expansion of our global sales channels. As you know, we're getting into, with some of these acquisitions, adjacent markets. David talked about some of the investments we're making in the sales channel to support the launch of the hyaluronic -- Gel-One hyaluronic acid product. So to the extent you might have expected more EBIT margin expansion, if you're not seeing it, it's because some of those savings are getting reinvested.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, very clear. And David, just thinking about your recon franchise and Persona, I think you've talked about a couple of things you're trying to achieve in recon, the first of which is obviously, improving clinical value. And I think you've also mentioned your desire to reduce complexity. And I'm trying to think about Persona with some of our early diligence. I mean, I think we understand there's definitely more customization and there's some excitement about that. But how do you think about the complexity argument? How does sales manage that in terms of total cost of ownership of the hospital system, just given perhaps better but more complicated instrumentation and actually increasing inventory versus reducing inventory? So how does the balance of clinical value versus complexity work with Persona as you begin the launch?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, this is consistent with what we've been talking about is the scope of innovation that's going to allow one to be most successful, and the marketplace that we're serving in the future is going to have to broaden. So we need to innovate not only with respect to the implant design and the capabilities that, that provides the surgeons to provide a personalized solution to a patient, but preoperative planning, intraoperative technologies. And so the Persona system is much, much more comprehensive than sort of a traditional implant approach. And this will be coming out in waves but we'll begin to have a more specific discussion within 2013 about that to get after the questions that you posed.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "So a couple of follow-ups, one on the changes that you're making in the U.S. in terms of distribution. Could you maybe provide a little bit of color into what impact, if anything, there was in the quarter from that? U.S. knee is obviously a little better than we were looking for. But I'm wondering what's the sort of net impact of some of those distribution changes in the U.S.? And then how we should think about that heading into '13? And then I have just a couple of follow-ups here.", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, I think that the net impact was positive. But we're not going to get into granularity by territory, Matt, as to try to measure that in dollars, and I don't know how anyone would do that either. You're talking about a large sales force and the connectivity and engagement of that large sales force. And obviously, if we're all aligned and we're providing the best products to that sales force to allow them to compete effectively in the marketplace, they're going to be more inspired and more effective, and I think that that's what we're beginning to see and we expect to see a lot more of it in 2013.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "There was, maybe early in '12, you were talking about some -- maybe inconsistency is too strong of a word, but areas in the U.S. where you felt really good about performance and then areas where you felt they were lagging. Would you say Q4 was more consistent? Or we're not there yet?", "David C. Dvorak", "No, it was. I mean, we're on the right track. You're always going to have -- in a ranking system, you're always going to have people that are performing better than others and look to move those mid-tier people or lower-tier people up or do something more radical, if necessary, to get them on the right track. So it was progress in Q4, and we expect to see more of it in 2013. But this is -- this isn't a discrete 3-month effort. This is just ongoing management of the business, Matt.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay. On spine, you mentioned in your prepared remarks the focus on core fusion technology, to get that going. Can you talk a little bit about what that means? Are you talking about strategic adds to that business? Are you talking about redesigning your main lines there? What -- help us understand a little bit about what that means.", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, I think that part of where we had been in that franchise is, as you're already familiar with, is we emphasized in the past some of the non-fusion technologies and we had picked up through bigger acquisitions, including way back when, the Centerpulse acquisition, the non-fusion system of Dynesys, with the uncertainty as to how to get those products approved through the FDA at this point in time. And we turned back to where the vast majority of that market reside, and that's core fusion. So outer bodies, inner bodies, low-profile solutions within that space are much of what we're doing. You shouldn't expect us to do anything in the way of a large acquisition within that space. Rather, I think that with the fragmentation of that marketplace and the technologies that have been developed and what's happened within that marketplace over the last several operating periods, we think we'd be in a good position to very economically pick up some product lines or some licensing deals that would augment our internal development.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay. And then finally for Jim, on the question on the P&L and kind of related to the rollout of Persona. As we think about rolling out a system of this magnitude, granted it's going to happen over a couple or a few years but invariably, there's an awful lot of new fixed capital assets in the form of instruments that's going out into the field. Early on, those are going to be underutilized relative to your sort of core NexGen line for example. Is that something that we've already started to see the impact on here in Q4? And maybe can you talk about where in the P&L that extra depreciation sort of drops and how that figures into 2013 guidance?", "James T. Crines", "Sure. So again, that is the case, Matt. Although I would tell you with this system, the approach is fundamentally different than from what it's been in the past. We have more streamlined way of kitting for surgeries for cases, and you'll be able to get a sense of that at the Academy meeting. We'll have an opportunity to demonstrate that a bit more clearly. Nonetheless, if you look at the cash flow statement for the fourth quarter, you would see that there was a fairly significant investment in instruments. Those are the instruments that are going to be getting deployed over the next couple of quarters in support of the launch of Persona and some of the other new products as well. That depreciation, when it begins to hit, will hit SG&A expense. But as it's hitting SG&A expense, the savings that we're driving out of the transformation initiatives are going to be hitting as well, and that is all reflected in the guidance that we provided.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "And as you get -- I guess, as utilization starts to pick up, not that we're -- we just got into '13 here, so we're not really talking about '14 yet. But is this -- that, I would imagine, is kind of a source of leverage back half '14 as volumes and utilization in turn kind of starts to ramp up. Is that fair?", "James T. Crines", "Well, we've said in response -- I've said in response to that question in the past that in this business, with our margins and particularly with the opportunity that we have to drive more significant leverage on those fixed costs, and the instrument depreciation is a good example of that. And we know that if we can -- to the extent we can get large joint reconstructive business growing up around mid single digits, the opportunity to drive leverage in EBIT is somewhere in the order of 40 to 50 basis points. So you're absolutely right. As we move into future periods with this particular system, we are going to have that opportunity.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from the line of Jason Wittes with Brean Capital.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "I wanted to ask about iASSIST. You previewed this last year at AAOS, and it got a lot of attention, certainly from investors but also from doctors. So I was wondering a couple of things about it. Number one, I know it's basically a tool. So are you actually charging for it and kind of what range? What kind of premium would be attached to it? And secondly, do you see this as actually something that can move market share for you?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, the answer is, to the last question, is yes, we do. We think that these smaller, faster, cheaper intelligent instruments that enhance the reproducibility of these procedures and enhance placement alignment which is exactly what iASSIST is focused upon, are going to be difference makers. And I think that over time, these technologies are going to become not only accepted and penetrate the market in a meaningful way, but I think that they're going to become the standard of care. I don't think that ultraexpensive upfront capital equipment-oriented systems are going to become the standard of care because of the environment that we're operating in. So we've been working for several years now. What you're seeing with the launch of the iASSIST and applying that technology in the knee procedure context, we do expect to get an incremental charge out of that system. These are disposable pods that are used for each procedure. And I think that as far as the pricing goes, you can think about that in a similar way that you think about our PSI technology.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And in terms of the rollout, I think it's actually -- you started rolling out last -- in the fourth quarter. How long should we anticipate before you can kind of fully roll it out to the entire -- to your entire customer base?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, this is one where, as you said, it did begin its formal rollout last quarter. We received FDA clearance. It was one of many clearances that came through in the fourth quarter across our various franchises. So we're excited to be at this stage. It will be featured at the Academy. There obviously is going to be a more intensive surgeon training and education effort built around the rollout of iASSIST. So you'll see it throughout 2013 and thereafter.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "And I guess just last thing on iASSIST, in terms of clinical data sort of backing the claims, what are you out there telling the field about that?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, typically, with these types of systems, we have all of the internal validations and labs, so sort of a bench testing the scientific data to support why this leads to the right placement and reproducibility and ideal alignment. And so that case can be made out presently. The long-term clinical benefits, obviously, will be a multiyear test, but we have the right studies set up to build that database out over time.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And just one quick clarification on the Persona Knee rollout. I know it's a multistage rollout. But I assume the first stage, from what you're implying, should be completed by the first half of this year, of 2013. Is that the right way to think about it?", "David C. Dvorak", "Well, I think that the first stage being the core primary system will be rolled out in, as I said, primarily, the U.S. market, but key o U.S. markets as well, it's just this is going to be every month rolling with various additions, augmenting the core system. And so we're talking about every month of 2013 and a handful of, literally, years thereafter that are part of this broader plan for us.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Jim, I was hoping to come back to something you answered in response to one of the previous questions regarding the 8% to 12% earnings growth goal. I know you talked about the medical device tax in 2013 presenting a headwind to operating leverage. But you only have that for half the year and obviously in 2014, you'd have it for the full year. So is there something else on a longer-term basis that could help offset that, where you have a tougher comp for the next couple of years? Is 8% to 12% more of an underlying number x the device tax?", "James T. Crines", "David, first of all, I would focus on the midpoint of the guidance and what's implied in terms of operating leverage for 2013, which we do expect to achieve in 2013 even in the face of having to offset the medical device excise tax. I would also just echo comments I made earlier in connection with where we are with respect to the restructuring and transformation programs, which together with our growth initiatives and our capital allocation strategies, is what gets us to feel very comfortable, very confident in our ability to deliver earnings per share growth in that 8% to 12% range over the long term. And as I pointed out earlier, we're in very good shape with respect to the progress we're making on those programs. We expect to end the year at a run rate of, as I said, somewhere between $210 million and $220 million in operating expense savings. Those savings, we'll be able to use, in direct response to your question about 2014, when we have to absorb another $20 million to $30 million of medical device excise tax. I pointed out earlier that in the short term, it is the case that some of those savings are getting reinvested. So a number of different areas where they're getting reinvested in the business. But as we get into future periods, as we get past some of the investments we're making in the short term in support of these, a number of significant new product launches, we'll have the opportunity to drive the kind of earning -- or the operating leverage that we need to, to deliver on that 8% to 12%.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So if we think just conceptually about the growth rate, top line and bottom line, it sounds like what you're saying is you're going to invest to drive new product growth and expand into faster-growth geographic regions. So we'll see an improvement in the top line as reflected in your guidance. Gross margins and it's sort of there are a number of moving parts there, the device tax, et cetera. You have some cost efficiencies that can help offset things like pricing. But where there is still a lot of room is on the discretionary expense side, particularly SG&A, to drive a meaningful amount of operating leverage. Is that a fair way just to think about it conceptually?", "James T. Crines", "I think that's very fair.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Rajeev Jashnani with UBS.", "Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I may have misheard this incorrect -- or misheard this, but did you mention that pricing was plus 50 bps in U.S. recon?", "David C. Dvorak", "No, we said 50 basis points of improvement sequentially from Q3 to Q4.", "Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, then that clarifies that.", "David C. Dvorak", "Okay.", "Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "A question just on the new product cycle and potential mix gains associated with that.  Some of your competitors are obviously launching new systems this year as well, and maybe you could help put in perspective what a mix benefit might be as you roll out a new product cycle, generally whether it's on the order of a couple hundred basis points. Presumably, while you're striving for share gains, I would think it's -- your competitors are obviously trying to do the same thing, which may make it a bit tougher there.", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, I think that there are mix benefit opportunities for us as we roll these systems out. If you focus on knees, for example, there are premium technologies that will be built into the Persona System. This is going to be, again, a very, very broad-based system. I think that for several operating periods to come, it's going to provide us with mix benefit. The range of that -- again, as we've said in the past, we think that on the high end, you probably are in a position to offset negative price in the current environment that we're operating in. That's a fair amount of mix obviously. If you don't have the launch of material new system in the large joint side, it's probably difficult to offset, through mix, the down price on the pure price side. But we ought to be in a good position to help ourselves on that front as this system launches more fully in 2013.", "Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And just if I can, one follow-up on the fourth quarter just on hips and knees. Was there -- I mean, Zimmer was a few hundred basis points below the competitors, below some of the competitors at least, in major joints. Maybe -- what's your perspective on that? And I know the new systems are going to be helping. But there was a pretty meaningful gap there. Any other perspective you could provide on that would be helpful.", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, I think that the gap there, obviously, Europe slowed down. We have a big hip business in Europe. That's a business that performed very well for us throughout the year. But it was a slow market in Q4, and so we're going to take a big chunk of that with our market share there. The knee opportunity on a global basis is going to change materially in 2013 with the launch of the Persona System. So we're going to focus on execution. I don't think it's several hundred basis points gap. But there is a gap, and we're going to close that gap in 2013 and get on top.", "Operator", "Our final question will come from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Just a couple of quick follow-ups really. Have you characterized at all the pricing premium for Persona? Clearly, new technology would seem to deserve and generate a bit better price. And I'll ask just the second follow-up now. It may be, David, may be a great time just to reflect on your latest thoughts on capital deployment, particularly in the acquisition side. Should we expect the recent activities to continue? And maybe just your updated thoughts on your priorities as to adjacencies or new markets or products.", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure, Rick. We do see opportunities on the premium price side with the Persona rollout. Our experience to date has been positive, and we would look to continue to drive mix benefit as we were just discussing in response to the last question, Rick. We don't want to quantify that at this point in time and obviously, this is a broad system. And so the mix opportunities are going to be different depending upon what configuration and what market we're deploying instruments and selling the Persona System at this stage. On the capital redeployment, I think that we've been very disciplined about the deals that we've done. We're going to see a lot of value creation from these bolt-on transactions, particularly ones that have taken us into new markets just because there's no cannibalization from the revenues when we pick up those product categories or bolt-on acquisitions. And so they're going to be top line accelerators for us, leveraging the existing distribution channels, leveraging our existing relationships, and we think that that's a great value-creation model. We're starting to see it in a couple of the product categories already. The ExFix system that we picked up is one of the difference makers within our trauma portfolio. Power tools, blades, the waste fluid management system is going to be a difference maker for us on the surgical side. And we'll look to do that even on the large joint side where we can pick up the right kinds of technology. So I think that you should expect to see more of the same from us. Again, to the extent that our aggressive and disciplined hurdle rates were met, would we be interested in doing larger transactions relative to the ones that we've been doing for the last several years? Sure. But we're going to be disciplined about it to make sure that the capital that we deploy into such a transaction is going to be value creating for our shareholders.", "So with that, I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today and for your continued support for Zimmer. We look forward to speaking to you on our first quarter conference call at 8 a.m. on April 25, 2013.

Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Operator", "Good morning. I would like to turn the call over to Bob Marshall, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Marshall, you may begin your call.", "Robert J. Marshall", "Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to Zimmer's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. I'm here with our CEO, David Dvorak; and our CFO, Jim Crines.", "Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.", "Also, the discussions during this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included within the earnings release, which is available on our website at investor.zimmer.com.", "With that, I'll now turn the call over to David Dvorak. David?", "David C. Dvorak", "Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call for the first quarter of 2013. This morning, I'll review our first quarter financial results, providing commentary on the year's progress to date and highlights from our performance. Jim will then provide additional financial details. I'll state all sales in constant currency terms, and I'll discuss all earnings results on an adjusted basis.", "We achieved our financial commitments in the first quarter, delivering leveraged earnings per share growth. During the quarter, we continued the introduction of significant new product offerings across the portfolio, which will accelerate top line growth for the balance of 2013. Ongoing progress in our commercial and operational excellence initiatives continues to generate savings in line with our long-term goals, while enabling us to make the necessary investments in support of the new product launches.", "Consolidated net sales for the quarter were $1.14 billion, an increase of 1%, and our earnings per share were $1.41, an increase of 8.5% over the prior year period. In the first quarter, Americas sales grew by 0.1%, while Europe, Middle East and Africa experienced growth of 1.8%, and Asia Pacific achieved growth of 2.8% year-over-year. We continue to deliver attractive growth in key emerging markets around the world.", "It is important to note that the quarter included 2 fewer billing days in the United States and in a number of key markets compared with the prior year period. On a like billing day basis relative to prior year, we estimate consolidated net sales growth for the quarter would have been 3.4%.", "Turning now to the results of our product categories. Knee sales for the first quarter were flat, reflecting positive volume and mix of 2.2% and negative price of 2.2%. In the quarter, our Americas segment reported a sales decrease of 2.5%, while Europe, Middle East and Africa sales increased by 3.2%, and the Asia Pacific region delivered 4.1% growth compared with the prior year. During the quarter, at the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons Annual Meeting, Zimmer officially introduced Persona The Personalized Knee System. Surgeon response at the meeting was outstanding, and clinical feedback from the first several thousand Persona surgeries has been excellent. The Persona System redefines personalization, offering unprecedented options for patient specificity. To create a more natural feel and normal function for patients postoperatively, personalized implants and precision instruments ensure better fit intraoperatively without the compromises inherent in competitive systems. Persona The Personalized Knee System, is the most comprehensive and highest fidelity system ever developed, featuring anatomically accurate implant components in finer increments. The Persona System also leverages Zimmer's proven Trabecular Metal and VIVACIT-E technologies for exceptional performance. We look forward to further penetration of this truly differentiated system as we continue to deploy implant and instrument sets in all geographic regions.", "Also at the AAOS meeting, we launched iASSIST Knee, the Personalized Guidance System, which elicited great interest from the surgeon community. iASSIST Knee represents the next step in intelligent instruments, offering significant benefits to patients, health care providers and health systems. This innovative technology comprises disposable digital components that provide accurate intraoperative feedback and alignment validation during joint replacement, supporting more streamlined and personalized procedures.", "While Persona and iASSIST represent major breakthroughs in knee replacement, we also are broadening our offerings in early intervention and minimally invasive joint preservation technologies. In the quarter, we began to record meaningful contributions from our Gel-One hyaluronic product, which provides our sales force with opportunities to engage a broader range of health care customers in the United States. As we build upon early success with each of these new technology offerings, we expect to deliver improved sales performance on our knee franchise globally.", "Hip sales decreased 2.4% in the quarter, reflecting positive volume and mix of 0.5% and negative price of 2.9%. Sales decreased by 1.3% in the Americas, 2.4% in Europe, Middle East and Africa and 4.8% in Asia Pacific compared with prior year. We've established a comprehensive portfolio of offerings in our hip business, supported by our proprietary Trabecular Metal Technology and VIVACIT-E advanced bearing material.", "Expanding our portfolio further, we recently received 510K clearance in the United States for the Avenir stem, a product that has enjoyed success on our European markets and that is compatible with the increasingly popular Anterior Supine approach. Going forward, we expect to leverage these broad offerings to improve performance in our hip business.", "Zimmer's Extremities business recorded sales growth of 7.0% in the quarter. Our Trabecular Metal shoulder products continued to generate attractive sales. At the AAOS meeting, we introduced the Trabecular Metal Total Ankle Replacement System, which supports a unique lateral surgical approach. This new system is the first ankle replacement to bring contemporary advances realized in knee and hip replacement to total ankle arthroplasty, including advanced bearing materials and anatomically matched shapes and sizes.", "In the quarter, we also gained regulatory clearance for NexCel[ph], our next-generation elbow system, which promises to strengthen Zimmer's already significant leadership position in the elbow market.", "Sales in our dental business decreased 1% in the quarter. We continued to face market softness internationally, with some stabilization in implant volumes in the United States. Zimmer Dental is receiving broad interest in the Trabecular Metal Dental Implant, for which positive clinical results have recently been published. Notably, in the quarter, as part of our agreement with Zfx Digital Dentistry Solutions, Zimmer opened a milling center for custom milled components in the United States.", "Our Trauma business continued to deliver impressive growth in the quarter, with sales increasing 10.7%, including 17.5% growth in Europe, Middle East and Africa. Once again, sales of our differentiated Zimmer Natural Nail products were strong in all regions.", "We also recorded increased sales of plates and screws systems, including the NCB Periprosthetic plate. The consistently positive performance of our Trauma business reflects the benefits of programs implemented over the past several years to expand our global sales channel and to establish an increasingly comprehensive product portfolio.", "Zimmer Spine reported a sales decrease of 10% compared to the prior year period. In the United States, we faced some disruption in the quarter stemming from actions taken during the fourth quarter related to our PEEK Ardis Interbody inserter. We do expect to resolve these issues by the second half of this year.", "Meanwhile, international results improved, including stable sales in Europe and growth of 19% in Asia Pacific. As we move through 2013, we anticipate recent product introductions will contribute to improved performance.", "Zimmer's surgical and other business delivered sales growth of 16.8% in the quarter, including impressive performances in all 3 geographic segments. These results were supported by increased sales of our tourniquet and skin grafting products. Capitalizing on the acquisition of Dornoch Medical Systems we close in late 2012, we recorded strong sales of our Transposal fluid waste management system in the quarter.", "I'll turn now to a couple of comments regarding the broader market and pricing. Although the global musculoskeletal market continue to be influenced by general economic conditions in the first quarter, growth rates remain in line with our expectations. With respect to pricing, we experienced price pressure of negative 2.0% the first quarter and that's a stable trend from the prior year, and consistent with our guidance.", "With that I'll now ask Jim to provide further details on the first quarter and our guidance. Jim?", "James T. Crines", "Thank you, David. I will review our first quarter performance in more detail and then, provide additional information related to our 2013 sales and earnings guidance.", "Our total revenues for the first quarter were $1,139,000,000, a 1% constant currency increase compared to the first quarter of 2012. As David noted, on a like billing day basis, estimated sales growth would have been an increase of 3.4%. Net currency impact to the quarter decreased revenues by 1.2% or $13 million. The negative currency impact for the quarter related principally to our Japanese yen denominated revenues and was partially offset by positive currency impact from our euro revenues.", "Our adjusted gross profit margin was 74.5% for the quarter. The margin ratio declined 30 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2012. In the quarter, foreign currency hedge losses to negative price offset cost savings from our operational excellence and transformation programs.", "The company's R&D expense decreased 10.2% on a reported basis when compared to the prior year. As noted in the prior quarter, the decrease in R&D expense continues to reflect the natural decline related to the completion of a number of large projects, as well as the efficiency benefits of transformation initiatives implemented in this function.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses were $461 million in the first quarter and at 40.5% of sales, were 10 basis points below the prior year. In the quarter, increased selling and marketing and distribution costs associated with the commercialization of a number of new products, as well as direct sales integration in certain key markets, were offset by savings stemming from our transformation initiatives.", "Special items amounted to $33.5 million in the quarter. Included in special items are costs related to our global restructuring and transformation initiatives, certain litigation-related charges and integration costs connected with recent acquisitions.", "Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to $333.9 million. At 29.3%, our adjusted operating profit ratio was 40 basis points higher than the prior year first quarter.", "Net interest expense for the quarter amounted to $14.5 million, which was flat compared to the prior year quarter. Adjusted net earnings were $240.8 million for the first quarter, an increase of 4.1% compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8.5% to $1.41 on 170.7 million average outstanding diluted shares. These adjusted earnings per share inclusive of approximately $0.06 of share-based compensation. At $1.28, reported diluted earnings per share increased 9.4% over the prior year first quarter reported EPS of $1.17.", "Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.8%, a decrease of 210 basis points compared to prior year. This rate reflects the full recognition of the R&D tax credit related to 2012, which was reinstated in January 2013 with the enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act. Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.1%.", "During the quarter, we repurchased 5.4 million shares at a total purchase price of $392 million, enabling us to return increased value to stockholders. Approximately $623 million of authorization remains under our repurchase program that runs through December 31, 2014. The company had approximately 169 million shares of common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2013, down from 177 million as of March 31, 2012.", "Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $180.5 million, a decrease of 13% from $207.4 million in the first quarter of 2012. The decrease is driven by the ongoing buildout of pipeline inventory in support of new product introductions.", "Net inventories were $1,039,000,000 at the end of the first quarter, an increase of $44 million from prior year-end 2012. Adjusted inventory days on hand finished the quarter at 311 days, an increase of 10 days compared to year-end 2012.", "As of the end of the first quarter, net receivables increased to $913 million from $895 million in the first quarter of 2012 or 2% over the prior year. Our adjusted trade accounts receivable days sales outstanding finished the quarter at 70 days, consistent with the prior year.", "Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter amounted to $85.1 million. Free cash flow in the first quarter was $105 million, $54 million lower than the first quarter of 2012. We define free cash flow as operating cash flow, less cash outlays for instruments and property, plant and equipment. The decrease in free cash flow reflects necessary investments in our product pipeline inventory and planned deployment of instruments to support the full release of Persona and other new products.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $75.4 million, including $57.5 million for instruments and $17.9 million for property, plant and equipment.", "I'll turn now to our guidance for 2013. In our earnings release this morning, we reiterated that the company expects full year 2013 revenues to increase between 2.5% and 4.5% constant currency when compared to 2012. We now expect foreign currency translation to decrease our reported 2013 revenues by approximately 1.5% for the full year. Therefore, on a reported basis, our revenues are projected to be between 1% and 3% above 2012 results. Previously, the company had estimated foreign currency translation would decrease revenues by approximately 0.5%.", "For the second quarter, we expect revenues to increase between 3.5% and 4.5% constant currency, and between 2% and 3% on a reported basis when compared to the prior year. As a result of the change in outlook for foreign currency translations, we now anticipate higher hedge gains to be recognized in 2013. Consequently, our gross margin ratio is expected to be between 75% and 75.5% for the full year.", "Our guidance for R&D, SG&A and interest expense for the full year remains unchanged. However, as we continue to support new product launches in the second quarter, our SG&A expense for the quarter is expected to be at or near the high end of our full year guidance range.", "Moving down the income statement, we now anticipate more significant tax benefits from our manufacturing network optimization efforts. As a result, we expect the 2013 full year effective tax rate to be around 26%.", "Full year 2013 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance remains within the range of $5.65 to $5.85. As previously indicated, to arrive at our anticipated reported GAAP earnings per share, you should subtract total charges for special items of $135 million pretax or approximately $0.60 per share. Taking into account the higher SG&A cost anticipated in the near-term and other factors, second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.45.", "Finally, please note that our guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or other unforeseen events.", "David, I'll turn the call back over to you.", "David C. Dvorak", "Thanks, Jim. Coming into 2013, Zimmer advanced a number of clinically differentiated new offerings through regulatory clearance and the initial stages of commercialization. Through the first quarter, we continue to receive a steady cadence of regulatory clearances for new products and technologies, demonstrating the ongoing productivity of our R&D programs.", "In late March, the output of our innovation pipeline was on display at the AAOS Annual Meeting, with significant new offerings in all of our established product categories and in many new and adjacent segments.", "In our knee business, we now offer an unmatched portfolio of products across the continuum of care from early intervention and joint preservation to the world's most personalized knee replacement system, complemented by the advanced intelligent instrument offering.", "To improve our sales effectiveness in support of these new product introductions, we continue to make progress in our commercial and operational transformation programs. While we make the necessary investments to support our new product introductions, these programs, also, are generating savings that are in line with our long-term targets.", "Finally, we continue to deploy capital in a disciplined fashion, returning value to our stockholders through an increased dividend and share repurchase program and pursuing prudent external development within the musculoskeletal space. We are confident that the foundation of work completed in the first quarter positions Zimmer for accelerated top line growth for the balance of 2013 including material contributions from our broad pipeline of new products.", "And now I'd like to ask Marley to begin the Q&A portion of our call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Taylor with Barclays.", "Daniel Sollof - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "It's actually Dan stepping in for Matt. Just a quick question. I appreciate the commentary on Persona and how that really becomes a more meaningful contributor towards, I guess, the back half of the year. Can you discuss Gel-One, which you called out as a meaningful contributor this year, power tools, VIVACIT-E, some of those other pipeline items, are those kind of also expected to ramp through the year or is it really mainly Persona, where it's more of a back half contributor?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, it's a good question. We have exciting new offerings in all of our product categories, Dan. And I think it's fair to say that the general launch plans for each of them would have them ramping as the year progresses. So if you look at knees, obviously, Persona is the largest launch in the company's history. We're just beginning that general release, and the academy was really the formal initiation of that launch program. So that will ramp as the year progresses, but we do expect it to be impactful in 2013. Within hips, our VIVACIT-E products have been out for a couple of quarters, and so the penetration rate continues to increase there, and that's going to be a significant help within our hip business. The Avenir hip stem will just get going in the second quarter, and so that will be a second half event for sure. And then, you get into Extremities, the Total Ankle Replacement and now the NexCel total elbow, that really will continue to sequentially progress through the year within the Extremities business. And you asked about Gel-One. Gel-One, really, was launched in earnest at the very end of last year, and we look to make good progress, are right on track, if not a bit above our plan expectations coming into the year within the first quarter and feel very good about the execution that we're running to within that opportunity category. And the list goes on and the others, I mean, there's obviously very significant opportunity within the surgical business, with some of the internal development projects that have been initiated and successfully completed over the last several years, as well as the external development projects, including the Transposal of fluid waste management system. So you should expect to see sequential improvement. And I would tell you that I am very confident that you are going to start to see some of the early benefits of these launches in the second quarter.", "Daniel Sollof - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. A very helpful guide. And then, just one quick follow-up on R&D. It dipped a little below where we're expecting, a little below the 5% kind of range. I appreciate your comments on -- you guys kind of completed a large number of projects. The transformation initiative was obviously helping there. But as far as a normalized rate going forward, is 5% kind of a good rate or I'm just kind of curious about where you see that longer-term and normalized, I guess?", "David C. Dvorak", "I think that, that is a good rate. It could dip, in some periods, a bit below that. It could accelerate a bit above that. We'll regulate it over time, but as far as a midpoint expectation, Dan, I think that reinvestment at that level is an appropriate way to think about it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.", "Unknown Analyst", "This is Rob in for Bob. My first question is just on Dornoch and, really, just how much capacity does Dornoch have to pick up lost business from the Neptune recall? For example, I think when you acquired Dornoch, they were doing about $10 million in revenue, but if the opportunity was there for them to do $30 million to $40 million, do they actually have the capacity to do that?", "David C. Dvorak", "They do. They do. And it's been a terrific effort, I will tell you, from the point of closing that transaction to ramping up production relative to the opportunity that we have before us. And I want to give a shout out to the Dornoch team and the broader integration effort that's taking place within the organization because it has been heartening to see the amount of work that people have been willing put in to fully exploit the opportunity that we have. We believed that this was going to be a good fit and plug a meaningful gap and address an opportunity that we have within our surgical portfolio, and it has exceeded our expectations to date. But we look to do big things in that category this year.", "Unknown Analyst", "Great. Very helpful. And I just wanted to get your thoughts on the pending AAOS statement on the clinical benefit of hyaluronic acid. When are you expecting that letter to come out, and do you think there is any chance that they changed their mind or what the impact of that letter could actually be on Gel-One and just the overall HA market?", "David C. Dvorak", "We aren't overly concerned about the outcome of that. The letters, I recall, went out for comments. And I think the comments were due in the early part of March. And there's speculation that the guidance document, whatever form it takes, may become available sometime, perhaps, next month. But I will tell you that the productivity that we're seeing within the sales force on the Gel-One product -- and if you think about it, the entire trend within the field, where payers are highly interested in early interventions and solutions that might represent either a deferment of the more significant procedure or even addressing that patient's issues to a point where a procedure -- a follow-on procedure, could be avoided. There's a high, high level of interest because it is a very cost effective way to treat patients and care for them. So I don't think, that market is going to go away, and we've received terrific feedback, the users of Gel-One to date. So I believe that we're very well positioned, and I think irrespective of what comes out of the guidance documents, we're going to continue to be able to address a significant clinical need with the Gel-One product.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "It's Steve Beuchaw here for David. A couple of housekeeping questions for Jim first. Number one, looking at the SG&A spend in the quarter, could you help us quantify or somehow dimension how much spend there was tied to the rather significant lineup of launches?", "James T. Crines", "I'm not going to get into providing, very specifically, what we're spending, the exact dollar amounts on the promotion activities that occurred over the course of the quarter. I would just point out that if you look back over the past several quarters, SG&A has been on a very positive trend in terms of having us bring the ratio down through the restructuring and transformation initiatives that we have underway. Those programs are still progressing in line with our long-term plans. We're hitting the targeted milestones that we have outlined with each of those programs. But we are, as we pointed out in the short-term, reinvesting some of those savings in support of these new product launches. And as I also pointed out in my comments, that's going to continue on into the second quarter. It's impacting and will impact on the ratio, again, in the second quarter. But as we progress through the balance of the year, you can expect to see us get back on a kind of positive trend in terms of continuing to bring that ratio down as a percent of sales, relative to prior periods.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "One more housekeeping, did you happen to call out the impact of the med tech tax in dollar or percentage terms in the P&L?", "James T. Crines", "It's not yet reflected in the P&L as we pointed out in the fourth quarter call. The tax, as it gets reported and paid, it gets capitalized, in our case, in inventory initially. It will begin to show up in the P&L in the second half of the year. We've estimated that we would expect to see somewhere in the order of $10 million to $15 million of charges working their way through cost of goods in each of the third and fourth quarters as we work our way through the balance of the year. It did impact our cash flow in the quarter. It's included in the increase that I referenced in my comments and inventory that we saw in the first quarter.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Got it. Very helpful. And then, one for David. Thinking about Europe specifically, you have a competitor that is expressing to investors they quite a bit of conviction in their ability to execute in Europe on share gains and commercial execution. Does your plan for the balance of the year anticipate that you continue to gain share? Can you just speak to the dynamics there and how you expect them to play out specifically in Europe?", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure. We do clearly expect to be continuing to take share in Europe, Steve. This is a business that's performed extremely well for us for a good number of quarters now. And they continue to outperform the market. I think as we saw in, maybe, the second half of last year and it looks like continuing into 2013, some of the developed markets are tough markets to grow in and yet, our team has been capable in delivering results that are consistent with several hundred basis points of above market performance, I believe, within the developed markets and then, executing very confidently on the plans within the emerging markets. And so we absolutely do believe that we are going to be able to continue even if the market is a bit challenged, at least, the subset of them that are considered to be developed.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "So one question just on sort of APAC and Europe, particularly, in what looks like it's quite different there, maybe, in terms of hip and knee [ph] growth. Could you tell us, maybe, about anything that's happening there in particular, any other -- I know it's the opposite side of the planet [ph], but anything that's happening in those regions? Any changes maybe you're making there to help drive growth in those regions? And I have one follow-up.", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure. I think that the general program is a consistent one with the last several quarters, Matt. And again, I think that we're outperforming the market in those developed countries by several hundred basis points, we believe. Obviously, within the quarter, we had a much stronger performance in knees than we did in hips, but we have some programs underway to address that. We have a good set of new product introductions that are going to assist on our hip performance on a global basis, too, and I referenced a few of those in the prepared remarks. So we're going to continue to leverage this team. And I believe we're going to continue to see terrific results. I do think, Matt, that the hip market was 1 point or 2 slower than the knee market in Europe and -- at least, in those developed countries. And so that explains part of the disparity of performance relative to our own results as well.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay. That's very helpful. And maybe sort of along -- on similar lines, I appreciate the color on price mix for hips and knees but also, kind of noticing a little bit of a difference there. I mean, is that -- mix is not usually a big part of the story in Europe, but the difference seems to be predominantly in mix. Could you maybe talk a little bit about seeing a relative difference in, maybe, what you see in the knees and sort of more flattish mix in hips?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes. I think that there's a bit of a difference at a given point in time that I think if you look at where we're doing well and where we have opportunities for improvement within the hip franchise, some of the recent launches in the areas that are most supportive of revisions, and I think that some of the competitors have had opportunities to accelerate the growth of their revision business probably in a way that they didn't initially plan for. But we've got a great pipeline. We're going to be able to exploit what we currently have, and I am excited about the things that are coming in the next handful of quarters, Matt, and I think that, that will improve both our opportunity for unit, and particularly on the premium side of the hip business with revisions. And that, obviously, translates into mix opportunities at the same time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.", "Craig W. Bijou - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "It's actually Craig Bijou on for Larry. Just a quick question on the EPS guidance. It looks like there are a couple -- the gross margin improvement, tax rate improvement. So there's a couple of benefits that you're going to have for 2013 for the full year. And I just wanted to see what -- if there were any takes in terms of possibly raising the guidance or sorry, negative impacts?", "James T. Crines", "Sure, Craig. The most significant negative impact would be the devaluation of the Japanese yen, which we've seen decline in value over the past 6 months by about 20 -- somewhere in the neighborhood of 20% to 30%. We have a large business in Japan that represents about 8% of our total consolidated revenue. So we -- while we are hedged and that's what's leading us to, sort of, lift the guidance for the gross margin ratio for the year, in absolute terms, we do lose some gross margin out of that business. We're able to offset that to some degree with hedges but to the extent we're not fully hedged. There is some loss there. So there -- we've taken that into account, obviously, together with the lower effective tax rate, again, the change in outlook with respect to the hedge gains and reiterating the guidance that we provided for the full year. So all of that is sort of factored into the guidance that we've provided.", "Craig W. Bijou - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then, one follow-up on Persona. I guess, what can you share about the metrics you're tracking in terms of what you deem to be successful adoption? So is it something like surgeon conversion and would you ever share that with us?", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure. I mean, that's one of the key metrics and, no, we're not likely to share it with you, Craig. But we're rolling that -- look, this is a very larger, multi-general -- multi-generational launch and it is formally initiated. So it includes a lot of instrument sets going out and you can see that reflected even on our cash flow statement with the instrument spend within the quarter and the investments that we're making there. So it's the biggest, fastest launch. But you'll recall that last year, we were slow walking this one to be absolutely sure that we had everything right. And I think that the methodical approach that we took in 2012 set us up very well for executing the plan that we have for 2013. So metrics will include, obviously, at -- as a threshold matter of getting the instrument sets out and deploy the allocation of those sets globally to opportunities that are consistent with our strategic priorities as it relates to the launch. And one of the areas that you mentioned, that's obviously very important to us, is to get those instrument sets into the hands of competitive surgeons and pick up competitive units by virtue of the deployment of those instruments. And so that is an area, among several, where there's a lot of intense target qualification and, literally, day-to-day and hour-to-hour attention being given to that element of the Persona launch. And what I would tell you is the interest level is very high, including among competitive surgeons and the feedback that we've received today, the clinical outcomes from these cases, has been nothing short of outstanding. So I'm very optimistic that this is going to be a successful launch and set us up not only to have good quarters as 2013 progresses, but good years ahead within our primary knee franchise.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.", "Kimberly Weeks Gailun - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "It's Kim in for Mike this morning. First question is on Gel-One. You made some comments earlier in the call on Gel-One progressing ahead of expectations for you guys here in the quarter. Can you just talk about why that is, what has been going better with the launch and maybe, some of the progress that you're making with formulary status.", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure. We're making progress with the specialty pharma side and establishing the appropriate hub relationships. And I think that we have a good plan, and we continue to execute on all the infrastructure that needs to be established to fully exploit the opportunity. But in addition to that, I would tell you that I think that the reason that we're so confident that we're going to be able to do at or better than planned, and this is our plan, as opposed to some of the speculation that the analysts have put out as to what 2013 might look like in this category. But we're so optimistic about our performance because fundamentally, I think that the engagement level and the oversight of the sales of the product is high and excellent, respectively. We are doing all the right things, gaining a lot of momentum and engagement with the sales force. We knew that in the first phase of the launch, it was a going to be all about leveraging our existing relationships. And that starts with us ensuring that our sales force, those that possess those relationships, are engaged and making it a priority to ask for this business and to become more familiar with the sale, which is a little bit different sale than what they have grown up doing on the implant side. So all indications are very positive, and it's one of a handful of top, top priority products for us this year because, obviously, it's a big opportunity for top line acceleration as it's a new product category. And so there is no revenue cannibalization. And fortunately, we are in a position where we have several others that fit that same definition.", "Kimberly Weeks Gailun - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Great. And a follow-up, maybe, for Jim on the second quarter guidance. So I think the guide looks like it's coming maybe a hair below the Street on the top line and, obviously, some of that is currency but certainly, below on the bottom line. Can you just remind us, is there any delta in selling days in the second quarter? And maybe it'll be helpful -- the gross margin might be the swing factor there. How should we think about the gross margin, sequentially, from 1Q to 2Q?", "James T. Crines", "Sure. So -- and first of all, on the billing days, as we said coming into the year that I think everybody understands we had 2 few billing days in the first quarter. We got back those 2 days, 1 each in each of the third -- or second and third quarters. I think that what I would focus on, I guess, with respect to the second quarter is the -- just the stage of where we're at with all of the new product launches. David has talked about the fact that there are new launches occurring across nearly across all of our product franchises. And all of those launches require some level of support in terms of promotion activities, training activities whether it's sales force training or surgeon training. So we're clearly going to be fully invested in supporting those launches to take full advantage of the opportunities we feel we have to accelerate our top line growth. And then, the other thing I would just point out, it's probably helpful to go back and look at the SG&A ratios that we report out on a quarterly basis. And I think if you do that, you would see that we typically gain much more leverage in the back half of the year, typically, in the fourth quarter, just as the consequence of the seasonality of our revenues in the way -- and the opportunities that we have to leverage our fixed cost in the fourth quarter relative to the earlier quarters in the year. And I don't know that that's really fully appreciated in the analyst models as I look at them. But it's really no more than that, that kind of leads us to the guidance that we've provided for the second quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "First, a quick clarification on Gel-One. You mentioned Gel-One in -- at the same time that you're talking about knee sales, and I just wanted to clarify, are Gel-One sales now being logged in your knee sales category or are they still in the other? And if you could, perhaps, break out how significant the contribution to that category from Gel-One was?", "James T. Crines", "Derrick, as a matter of fact -- this is Jim. If you look at the sales table in the release, you'd see a footnote at the bottom of the table that does indicate that certain product sales had been reclassified from surgical and other category to knees. And now this is in recognition of the fact that we have a growing portfolio of early intervention devices that are generally used in treating pain or osteoarthritis of the knee joint, including Gel-One; DeNovo, but as well, the DeNovo NT Natural Tissue Graft and our Chondrofix Osteochondral Allograft. And recognize that these products are all sold through our global reconstructive sales channels and are expected to become an increasingly important subcategory within our knee franchise, especially in the way in which they could be co-marketed with our partial knee replacement devices like the patellofemoral joint,  the Zimmer Uni Knee. We have -- to help you with your sales model -- models rather, we will be posting a schedule on the Investor page for zimmer.com website showing the adjusted product category sales by quarter for the prior year. Those adjustments -- in response to your last question, by quarter, are small. The aggregate sales of the products were less than 1% of our consolidated sales in 2012. But again, we anticipate significant growth in this subcategory of early intervention devices going forward.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And then, a quick follow-up on Dornoch. Could you give us a sense for the contribution that Dornoch made to your other category this year as well -- or this quarter as well?", "David C. Dvorak", "It was relatively significant within the surgical line but I would tell you, probably, round numbers, something in the range of half the growth when you take that overall growth rate.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Great. That's very helpful. Turning to Persona, so one of the sort of consistent messages that we've gotten back from AAOS as we sort of surveyed surgeons on their feedback to Persona, there's generally strong enthusiasm. Many surgeons were very interested in using the product, but we did hear quite a few of them say that they weren't sure if their hospital would be willing to pay a premium price for that product. So I was wondering if you could maybe give us some color on how you're approaching those discussions with the hospitals? How you're approaching that pushback and kind of maybe what you're seeing there, that would be helpful.", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure. And what you are describing is not a different dynamic than any other product category or launch that takes place within the industry. And I think we're all pretty familiar with the pricing environment that we're operating in. And I think that across the various competitors, you get pretty consistent messaging as to what that pricing environment looks like. But I would tell you that one of the reasons that we're so enthusiastic about the opportunity that we have with Persona, is that we do believe that we've hit the mark with respect to innovation in a way that is going to resonate with various stakeholders that are going to be involved in the decision process. So we've spoken a lot about why we believe that this is going to prove to be a more personalized solution and improve the fit, feel and function from the patient's perspective. And your question, specifically, as to how you sell through the surgeons and the hospital administrators and other decision-makers in that process includes the fact that we developed instrumentation, an intelligent instrumentation that we believe can not only deliver a terrific result for the patient, but can make economic sense to the hospital administrators, the kitting of the instruments, and it enhanced the opportunity to make the procedure go very smoothly, less instrument sets, shorter OR times and improved terms, lower central sterilization costs with the instrument configuration, preoperative planning systems that will enhance the productivity of the ORs and the quality of the outcomes as well. And then, you have the advanced technologies. Obviously, the patient is going to care a lot about premium technology, like VIVACIT-E, with 90% wear reduction, tests that we're going to be rolling out and publishing. But the surgeons and the hospital administrators are going to -- are going to be able to focus and find a lot of value from elements of this system that include the fact that it's going to be the first fully cement-less construct, featuring Trabecular Metal Technology on the femur, tibia and patella. You can do some math around that in the OR for -- set time for cement and how much that adds to the procedure. And again, on the patient side, that's increased tourniquet [ph] time, et cetera. So we just feel like this has been a huge effort that we've been able to pull together innovations not only on the implants but the instruments, the configuration of those instruments, preoperative planning systems, intraoperative technologies that include the eLIBRA, iASSIST, PSI. And when you integrate all of those elements together, there's a value proposition for patients, surgeons, hospital administrators alike.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I do have a question in Extremities. I listened to you talk about the Total Ankle, as well as the new elbow. Can you please remind us where you are on the shoulder business?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes. We do well on the shoulder business. Again, we've had tens of quarters of double-digit growth with our Trabecular Metal product offering on the shoulder side. So we continue to innovate in that area, but we have a significant share position at this point in time. And frankly, Joanne, at this point with early launches in the ankle and relative market size in elbows, even though we have significant leadership position in elbows, our Extremity business today is all shoulders, effectively.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. And then, on the sales force side, can you give us an idea how you're adjusting those headcount numbers as you enter all of these new product launches?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, I mean, we obviously are expanding the sales force in a manner that's consistent with the focus products. And so in some instances, that means more feet on the street as general sales reps. In other instances, it means enhancing the general reps' capabilities with field specialists. And so it's a combination of the two. And I would tell you that it's probably a combination of those two on a global basis. But most significant emphasis placed on more feet on the street within the United States market because there are -- more of those product opportunities reside, at least initially, here.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Turkaly with JMP Securities.", "David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "And just to push it a little bit on the Persona metrics, but given your size in the knee market today and all the new products you have from instrumentation and kitting and the features you spoke about 3 quarters less than the year. Would it be fair to say that you expect to lead the knee market in the Americas before this year is out, i.e., take share?", "David C. Dvorak", "We're going to have you present to our sales force at our national sales meeting, Dave. That is our goal. We're the global leader in knees. And we've been at it for a good number of years with respect to these various innovation efforts that have matured into the Persona system, as well as all of the related and complementary surgical instruments and intelligent instrument offerings. And so when you pool that together, you take the continuum of care with early interventions, the patellofemoral joint, the Zimmer -- ZUK on the uni side, with excellent clinical results and leveraging off of our terrific legacy of NexGen NK II Systems and advancing into the next generation of solutions with the Persona offering. If we can't get this one right, shame on us. But we will.", "David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "And just as a quick follow-up on Gel-One. Obviously, non-ortho guys use these products. I wonder if you have any evidence of where you stand today that some of your core non -- just your hip and knee franchise guys have utilized the product or if that share is a little stickier to get into the non-ortho docs?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, I think that our initial push, Dave, is within the ortho space because that's where we have the relationships. Now we have phased plans as to how we're going to get after bigger and bigger pieces of this market, but the instant offense for us is clearly on the ortho side. And then, with the establishment of the specialty pharma relationships, the pull-through scripts that flow but again, fundamentally, we're leveraging our relationships with the orthopedic surgeons.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with Leerink Swann.", "Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "Just two quick ones. First on Extremities, I appreciate that most of your Extremities right now is focused on kind of the upper segments within the body, but maybe, just your -- some of your competitors are seeing very strong growth in foot and ankle. I understand that your Total Ankle product is going to probably catapult you more significantly into that area. Do you have any other internal or external plans for some of the kind of other non-Total Ankle Replacement portions of that market that seem to be growing? And where do you think you are on the -- or how quickly do you think that Total Ankle Replacement can begin to have foot and ankle impact?", "David C. Dvorak", "Good question. I mean, it is at this stage, Richard, that we're very interested in taking more advantage of, obviously, a fast growing space. You referenced the Trabecular Metal Total Ankle Replacement System and that really is our entree into that space. But just to answer your general question, yes, we do have both internal and are interested in external development opportunities to expand our offering and make sure that we are working our way promptly towards a comprehensive offering in that anatomical space.", "Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And then, just maybe a quick one on spine. Can you -- you said you had a bunch of new products anticipated. I wasn't sure if that commentary was directed for Asia Pacific, specifically, or the U.S., as well globally. Can you just comment on what some of those new product areas might be. And then, secondly on spine, it looks like your pricing actually improved little bit sequentially. Any changes in the reimbursement landscape or price negotiation conversations?", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure. It did improve, as you can see sequentially, and it was fundamentally an anniversary-ing out of some of the more significant price downs that we experienced in prior periods. And so in our case, a bit of stabilization on price and certainly, want to work towards optimizing the chance of that. Do we make that a trend? But we are a small player within that space, so it's tough for me to give you much value by the way of extrapolating our experience into a broader market environment. I mean, it certainly doesn't feel to us as though it's getting worse relative to what it was. And I do think it's an early sign of stabilization within our business on the price front. With respect to product development, we're very focused on innovating within the core fusion space. And so the products that we have developed and begun to launch are focused in that area, we're doing very well with the Trabecular Metal Interbodies. Obviously, some of what you saw on the U.S. business that I think would have made progress otherwise in the quarter, faced some headwind because of the PEEK inserter that we had to feel the action with respect to -- but as I said, we're well on our way to getting a 510(k) trial and getting that inserter, and as a consequence the Interbody, back into our bag and moving forward with that, I believe that will happen before the year is out on the clearance side. But in the meantime, we're executing better o U.S., and I think that the Spine team has done a good job of developing cost effective solutions for some of those, o U.S. markets. In the core pedicle screw side, those products are getting launched. I think that we're going to see productivity from those launches. And then, back in the U.S., we've launched a couple of products that are important relative to the space, one of which is maybe a bit more niche, but an important one and a nice innovation and then, are just beginning to launch what I think will become meaningful within the year, and that's the Apex System [ph] that is more geared towards deformity and complex spine cases. And that's a subset of the market that is not insignificant that, historically, we didn't have much of an offering to be able to compete effectively within. And so I'm quite confident that we're going to see sequential improvement within our Spine business as this year progresses.", "Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "Great. And if I could, just one last one on my first question on the foot and ankle space. Can you maybe tell me what areas of that market do you think are most important as you kind of look to broaden out your scale? Is it on the distribution side or is there a specific product area that you'd like to have?", "David C. Dvorak", "Well, I think for us, it starts with the products. Obviously, you're familiar with the space and so the call point becomes a bit different, but none of the distribution channel issues are paramount until you've got products to sell. So I believe that the TM Ankle is going to be a difference maker. I think we're going to be able to further leverage TM into that space. And then, obviously, we have much of the capabilities necessary to do anything by the way of plating solutions and innovate within that space because it's very transferable from our other businesses, including our trauma business. So we like it. We're going to grow it. We will compete very effectively within that space going forward. And as we have with other business segments, we're going to be, hopefully, smart and methodical about the pace of investment in various areas and try to avoid the progress being serial across product development and distribution channel expansion, but you have to have the products before the sales force can become a productive investment for you. So I would put it in that order.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "David, just wanted to start with you on Gel-One, and I think we're all trying to feel out here, can this be a $35 million, $70 million, $100 million product line this year? But as I think about the fact that you touched about 25% of the knee guys out there in the U.S., would it allow you -- the formularies -- you're getting on some of the commercial payer formularies, some of the work you're doing in the specialty pharma, getting on those panels, would it be possible for you to touch or -- for 1/3 to, maybe, 1/2 of your knee surgeons to have access to Gel-One this year?", "David C. Dvorak", "This is the first full year of the launch, Jeff, and I have no doubt that this is a going to become a significant product category. We -- first of all, it's a great product and the clinical results and the feedback that we are receiving is extremely positive. So there's some infrastructure to continue to build out on the sales side and some of which, you were just referencing. We're doing exactly what we should be doing in that regard. I think that expectations for this product -- I would tell you, that I look at it and say if you do the math on the subset of the market that we're going to have immediate access to, again, focusing on leveraging our orthopedic surgeon relationships, this can be tens of millions of dollars in 2013, but I think you start working your way up towards something like $50 million, and that's just -- that's a big number to come out of the blocks. And if you look at any of the competitors within the space and the pace of penetration in the first full year, that would be, I believe, far in excess. Now we're going to keep pushing the opportunity, but just to manage your expectations of that, I'd frame it out to you that way.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. We've been saying $30 million to -- $35 million, so I think it sounds like that. Well, it's kind of what where your expectations might be anyway. Jim, just one last question, then, for you. And obviously, your big competitor that reported last night has a slightly different hedging strategy than you do, but they pointed to the low end of their guidance range, just given some of the yen movement and what have you. Could you make any comments at all about the range of your guidance, given some of the foreign currency headwinds you'll be dealing with this year?", "James T. Crines", "No. Very comfortable with the guidance we've provided coming into the year. And so we've taken into account the effects of the yen devaluation in terms of what that will have on our business for the full year. We've -- as I said earlier on the call, going to have some opportunity to offset -- to be clear, we're not fully hedged. The hedge has certainly helped us recover some of the lost top line and the impact that has on margin. But to the extent we're not fully hedged, we have other opportunities mentioned. The fact that we're going to have -- now expecting to have a lower effective tax rate for the full year to offset the impact of the yen devaluation. So very comfortable with the range we provided coming into the year and obviously, we iterated that in the release and on the call here this morning.", "Robert J. Marshall", "Marley, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "All right. And your last question comes from the line of Bill Plovanic with Canaccord.", "William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Two questions, really. One -- and they're both SG&A-related. Just to understand, as you talk about leverage through the year, I would take it that's predicated on a revenue increase and not a spending decrease? And then, the second question is, as you look at the program you're going through in terms of cost reduction, is there a tipping point or a big step-up at any point as you've eliminated some prior SKUs or what have you, to help us drive some further benefits to the operating line?", "James T. Crines", "Let me just start by kind of reiterating what we said coming into the year about the restructuring and transformation initiatives in terms of how they're going to impact on the current year. We expect to generate full year savings out of the actions that are going to be taken this year of about $80 million, $30 million to $40 million of that will be realized within the year. More of that, perhaps, in the second half of the year as we work our way through the year and those actions are taken. So it is the case that there are cost reductions that are occurring as we work our way through the balance of the year. Then that, together with the leverage we're going to be able to gain from an accelerated top line, are what will drive the kind of leverage we're looking to achieve for the full year in SG&A. So it is a combination, really, of realizing that $30 million to $40 million of savings that we talked about coming into the year, in terms of how that's paced out over the course of the year, together with the leverage, as I said, from an accelerated top line as we get into the balance of 2013. So that, again, gets us to that 39.5% to 40% expectation that we have for the full year, Bill.", "William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Okay. But so just for clarity, though, kind of excluding the savings from the previous programs, it's kind of like this bump-up in distribution investments, what have you, it is predicated on that revenue ramp excluding those savings to kind of get to the leverage we're talking about?", "James T. Crines", "Yes, there's no doubt that the revenue ramp is going to provide a meaningful -- lead to a meaningful opportunity to drive leverage in SG&A on the back half of the year.", "Robert J. Marshall", "I would like to thank everyone for joining the call today and for your continued interest and support for Zimmer. We look forward to speaking to you on our second quarter conference call, which is scheduled for 8 a.m. on July 25. With that, I'll turn the call back to you, Marley.", "Operator", "Thank you very much and thank you, again, for participating in today's conference call.

I would like to turn the call over to Bob Marshall, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Marshall, you may begin your call.", "Robert J. Marshall", "Good morning, and welcome to Zimmer's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. I'm here with our CEO, David Dvorak; and our CFO, Jim Crines.", "Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties. Also, the discussions during this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included within the earnings release, which is available on our website at investor.zimmer.com.", "With that, I'll now turn the call over to David Dvorak. David?", "David C. Dvorak", "Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll review our second quarter financial results, providing commentary on the year's progress to date and highlights from our performance. Jim will then provide additional financial details. I'll state all sales in constant currency terms, and I'll discuss all earnings results on an adjusted basis.", "Turning first to global market conditions. In the second quarter, musculoskeletal markets demonstrated stability with modest improvements over the first quarter. This was in line with trends from the previous several quarters, as well as our expectations for the full year. Against this backdrop, Zimmer delivered strong sales results in the second quarter, driven by contributions from our innovative new products across the portfolio, as well as accelerated performances in key geographic regions. This top line performance represents the company's strongest sales growth in several quarters and validates our belief that there are significant opportunities for innovation and growth within the musculoskeletal space.", "We, again, delivered against our financial commitments and returned value to our stockholders in the quarter. For the balance of 2013, we'll continue to drive our top line through the ongoing commercialization of innovative new products. We'll also remain focused on our business transformation programs, which continued to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of our global organization.", "We expect the continued benefits from our expanding portfolio, combined with our commitment to operational excellence and a strategy of disciplined capital deployment, will allow us to capture further value creation opportunities in 2013.", "Consolidated net sales for the quarter were $1.17 billion, an increase of 5.5%. And our earnings per share were $1.43, an increase of 6.7% over the prior-year period.", "In the second quarter, Americas sales grew by 7.6% year-over-year, while Europe, Middle East and Africa increased by 0.5% and the Asia Pacific region grew 6.9%.", "The quarter was highlighted by the achievements of key milestones on the ongoing commercialization of several new offerings, which the company has recently developed or strategically acquired. These products and technologies have strengthened our core reconstructive franchise, as well as our emerging businesses.", "With respect to pricing, we experienced price pressure of negative 1.3% in the second quarter. Price pressure tempered relative to the first quarter due mainly to the anniversary-ing of the biannual price adjustments in Japan and slight moderation of price pressure for large joint reconstruction in the United States.", "Turning now to the results of our product categories. Knee sales for the second quarter increased 4.7%, reflecting positive volume and mix of 6.1% and negative price of 1.4%.", "Our Americas segment reported a sales increase of 5.0%, while Europe, Middle East and Africa grew sales by 0.4% and the Asia Pacific region delivered 9.8% growth compared with the previous year.", "We continue to be excited about the ongoing commercial release of Persona The Personalized Knee System. Persona has revolutionized the standard of care by eliminating the compromises inherent in competitive platforms, offering patients a more natural feel, fit and normal function postoperatively. With Persona, we pushed the boundaries of implant design and engineering, resulting in the highest fidelity and anatomically accurate implants ever developed. These components also leverage Zimmer's proven Trabecular Metal technology and VIVACIT-E, our vitamin E-infused advanced-bearing material. Our next-generation intelligent instruments make Persona more accurate and intuitive for surgeons to implant, and the feedback from our customers continues to be extremely positive for the unmatched flexibility and surgical precision of this system. We look forward to further expanding the market penetration of this truly differentiated need.", "Knee growth in the second quarter also benefited from promising sales of Gel-One, Zimmer's single-injection hyaluronic acid treatment. Gel-One is a key component of our expanding portfolio of early intervention and joint preservation solutions, including DeNovo NT and Chondrofix.", "In the quarter, Zimmer acquired U.S.-based Knee Creations, including products and technologies used in their advanced proprietary early intervention treatment, Subchondroplasty.

Just wanted to start with pricing. You guys noted a slight moderation of pressure in the quarter. Part of that was Japan, but you also referenced the moderation of the large joint market as well. So I'm just wondering, to what extent does that surprise you guys? And would you go so far to suggest any potential change in trend? Or is this more of just like a quarter-to-quarter variation and year-over-year pressure?", "David C. Dvorak", "Well, I think that the biggest contributor -- Dan, as you pointed out, the biannual price cuts anniversary-ing out in Japan. Beyond that, we saw a little bit of price pressure increase in Europe. But again, as you mentioned, a positive change in -- from Q1 to Q2 in the Americas. So it's round numbers, I think, 30 basis points for us in the Americas; and it was about 80 basis points improvement sequentially from Q1 to Q2 in each of knees and hips. As far as extrapolating out and forecasting whether or not that's the beginning of a trend, I think it's too early to do that. I do think that it's fair to characterize pricing as stabilizing. And quarter-over-quarter, we've got to -- tend to be getting, hopefully, what becomes a positive trend in that regard.", "Daniel Sollof - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Great. And then 1 quick follow-up on guidance. You took up the constant currency revenue expectation by about 100 basis points. So you said the general market seems stable. So is that really incremental confidence or more visibility to benefit from new products? Or -- just kind of want some color there.", "David C. Dvorak", "I think that, generally, you can interpret the top line guidance, Dan, as being of view that the market is performing in a manner that's consistent with our expectations going into the year, and we're making the progress that we expect to make on the new products. And it's really the latter that is driving the increase in the top line forecast as we get further and further into the launch of these new products. And these products are going to find traction at different stages just by the nature of the launches across the various product categories. But we're tracking quite well in all respects. And what you see, in a way, of the updated forecast is a reflection of our confidence as to what we're going to be able to do in the second half of the year and going forward.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.", "Craig W. Bijou - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "It's actually Craig on for Larry. First quick question, I wanted to get your thoughts on Europe. It looks like performance ticked down a little, adjusting for selling days compared to Q1?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes. And I think that Europe continues to be a challenging market. I don't believe that it sequentially got worse from Q1 to Q2. I think that our heavy emphasis in particular countries -- and we have significant market share in the developed markets in Europe. By way of example, it's probably, as much as anything, our revenue mix within countries that have shown a significant slowdown over the last several quarters that you see reflected in our performance. So we continue to be very optimistic about what we're going to be able to do, continue to believe that we're outperforming the general market in EMEA. But it's a challenging market, and we have a lot of market share in countries that have seen significant step-downs including a market like Germany.", "Craig W. Bijou - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And 1 quick follow-up. Just on the SpineCraft, NORMED, Knee Creations agreements and acquisitions, I wanted to see if you would provide the expectation for the contribution that it will have for 2013 growth?", "David C. Dvorak", "Well, it's going to contribute -- all of those external development projects, Craig, are going to contribute to 2013 growth. But they're going to contribute to 2013 growth because of what we're going to be able to do with those products and technologies through our distribution channel. I'd like to clarify that the accelerated top line that you see us reporting in Q2 is not by virtue of acquired revenues. It is the case that the external development projects that we've been doing fairly consistently over the last several years contributed positively to that uptick. But I would tell you that the acquired revenue run rate effect on Q2 is probably a bit less than $5 million, so not at all substantial. Now that said, several of those products that we've acquired over time are ramping up as we launch them and execute our sales and marketing strategies. So we're seeing significant contributions, but not by virtue of having acquired the revenue, rather by virtue of acquired -- acquiring an appropriate technology or product line that's a fit for our distribution channel and our overall strategy.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So quickly -- I have a question on operating margins and then a question on knees. First, on operating margins, it looks like your guidance really isn't changing overall from an operating margin perspective, but gross margin is obviously coming down by a little over 1 point, it looks like. So my question on gross margins is, Jim, can you kind of break down the components of the change in a little bit more detail and, more importantly, maybe comment on, as we look forward, do you think your business -- relative to the mix that you expect, can you as a company get gross margins back over 75% as you look out into next year?", "James T. Crines", "Okay. Bob, I'll take a stab at that. As you know, coming out of the first quarter, we were, at the time, thinking gross margin ratio would be coming around 75% to even 75.5% for the full year. That, of course, was predicated on anticipated hedge gains based on the currency assumptions we have for the top line at that point in time and lower unit cost from a combination of higher volumes associated with our new products, as well as efficiencies gained from improvements in our manufacturing processes. And then, of course, offsetting those positive effects on ratio, we also anticipated negative price and the medical device excise tax would impact on the ratio in the second half. We were not, at that time, anticipating the strength in surgical product sales that we realized in the second quarter or the effect that would have on our gross margin ratio. We were also not expecting that excess in obsolete inventory charges would be as high or that the changing mix for geographic revenues would have, again, as much of an impact as we experienced in the quarter. So with taking all of that now into account, we have adjusted our outlook for the ratio for the full year to now be at or slightly above 74%. We, as you pointed out, have also raised our outlook for top line updated guidance for operating expenses, the net effect of which lead us to our bottom line adjusted diluted earnings per share expectation of $5.70 to $5.80 for the full year. Now that as -- between the various sort of things that I've touched on, the product mix, the geographic mix, the inventory charges, I would say the product mix, the inventory charges accounted for most of the, sort of, step-down in the gross margin ratio in the quarter relative to the prior year. Geographic mix had a less of an impact. And as we get into the second half of the year and even next year for that matter, I think we feel, for a lot of reasons, that we can anticipate a bit less pressure on the margin ratio from excess and obsolete inventory charges. We get those in the normal course, but they -- as they have over the first half of the year, they could be more significant as we launch new systems and we begin to cannibalize out the legacy products. So we've had more significant pressure from those charges in the first half of the year than we're either anticipating for the second half of the year, and we still have work to do to to fill up our operating plans for next year than I would expect we'll see going into next year. We also expect more favorable hedge results coinciding with the change in the currency outlook, as well as expect the shift towards higher-margin revenue as we get deeper into the launch of Persona, and our surgical product sales reflect the better balance of revenue as between the capital equipment and single-use disposables. And I think both those trends should continue on into next year. I'm not going to attempt to give guidance on the gross margin ratio for 2014. We'll certainly be prepared to talk about that in more detail after we've gone through our development of our operating plan and provide guidance for 2014 on our fourth quarter call.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "That's very helpful. So it sounds like there's a couple of things that will get better from here, and we'll have to see how the mix plays out as we look to next year. And then, on knees, 2 things maybe for David. I was wondering if you could just comment on the contribution from Gel-One, given that that's now reported in knees. I have assumed that it maybe would be $5 million to $10 million this quarter. And then, also, David, maybe give a sense for just where you think you are with Persona? Any metrics in terms of the rollout? Is it -- any metrics that we can track as to where you think you are right now relative to your original set of expectations?", "David C. Dvorak", "Bob, we're tracking consistent with expectations. With respect to the Gel-One rollout, first of all, it is in the range that you suggested, but probably closer to the lower end of that range than the higher end of the range for the quarter that you framed out. We are doing everything on schedule with respect to the Persona release, and the feedback has been very, very positive. So our instrument deployments is one of the key metrics. We're on plan with respect to the instrument deployment. You can obviously see that in our reinvestment numbers, with respect to the CapEx for the last couple of quarters. I would tell you that the receptivity among competitive surgeons is quite good at this point. But as you would anticipate, notwithstanding the positive reception to the Persona System -- and I would tell you, if anything, I think, at this point, the anecdotal evidence has exceeded our expectations -- or reasonable expectations, as optimistic as we were going into the year. So it's going to be a very, very strong product line for us. And it clearly already is helping to reinvigorate our knee sales, and you see that in the step-up from Q1 to Q2 in our growth rate. But those systems take longer to get full traction. And so in the first half of the general release, which is what Q1 and Q2 of 2013 represent, that still is very early stage. All of the leading indicators that we track, as I said, are positive and I'm quite confident that this system is going to be a big winner for us.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.", "Kimberly Weeks Gailun - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "It's Kim here for Mike. So a couple of questions. I guess, as we think about the constant currency guide here for the rest of the year, Europe is a little softer in the quarter. And you guys touched on some of that, highlighting Germany. I'm just curious how you're thinking about Europe playing out for the rest of the year. And then, in addition, you saw kind of the step-up in the quarter in the fluid waste management business. Is that something you're looking forward to be sustainable in the back half of the year, and how does that play into that kind of 4% to 5%?", "David C. Dvorak", "Great. I'll respond to each of those questions. With respect to Europe, first of all, I think that Europe will continue -- we think that Europe will continue to be a challenging market. But what I would tell you is if you look back at the second half of 2012, we really started to see a step-down in the growth rate and procedure rates within many of the developed markets in Europe, and that's really what I think is affecting the overall growth rate of the EMEA market. So in the very least, there should be some positive effect to the anniversary-ing out of that step-down in procedure rates in some of those developed markets, and we have significant businesses in those markets. And so I think that bodes well for, at least, stability in Europe, if not some potential improvement, even without a more fundamental beginnings of a recovery. And so, that's how we are thinking of the European market at this point in time.", "Kimberly Weeks Gailun - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Great. And then, the second question was just on the waste management side.", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure. And the surgical business, we continue to believe, will be a terrific opportunity for us in the second half of the year. That said, you can see by the growth numbers in the U.S., in particular with the fluid waste management system, that we're at a pretty torrid pace in Q2. And so, 40-plus-percent growth rate in the business category -- or the product category for us in Q2 is one that we'd love to be able to sustain, but that's probably on the high end of what anyone could consider a reasonable expectation. That said, we're going to continue to go after the opportunity that we have there and believe that we're going to continue to grow that category at very attractive rates.", "Kimberly Weeks Gailun - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then, just 1 follow-up on Gel-One is just kind of any anecdotal feedback from how that launch is going for you guys, what you're hearing from surgeon customers just in light of broader industry guidelines and how the surgeons are thinking about prescribing patterns and behavior?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, no negative effects on that development. At this point in time, obviously, for us, it's a smaller product category because it's a recent launch. But we haven't seen any callback on the usage rate. It's probably a question that would be posed, and maybe you'll get a more comprehensive response from someone who's been in the market for an extended period of time relative to us. But we don't see that creating any immediate headwind, and our launch is tracking at or in front of the pace that we contemplated in the plan. I would tell you, we continue to get terrific feedback on the product itself. The lower volume -- the great track record on lack of any kind of pseudo-sepsis response with that product has made it one that our customer base has been very receptive to integrate it into their practice.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "So generally, obviously, pretty impressive step-up in knee growth. Can you talk about -- 1 question on that, and then I have a follow-up for Jim on margins. Just on the knee side, what's -- can you talk about what sort of dialogue you've been having around the premium for the product? That was the question at the rollout, you obviously wanted to be able to get paid for the development and research that's gone into the system. Environment's a little tougher maybe than the last large knee launch that we've seen, and we'd love to hear what the response has been and how you've been able to capture some of that value. And as I mentioned, a follow-up for Jim.", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure, Matt. The response that we've received to date has been very positive. And I would say, if anything, probably on the upside, within the range of our expectations going in as to what we thought we could get to stick from a price standpoint. And the core value proposition there is one that speaks to the broader audiences that we're involved in and selling such a product and technology at this point in time as compared to a decade ago as you referenced to a prior knee system launch. So we're getting a great response from the surgeon community on the personalized implants. These things -- the implant design allows for better fit, feel and function and very anatomically accurate. Terrific feedback on the anatomically designed tibia, the coverage with that tibia and what that leads to as far as performance and rotation. The bone-conserving nature of the implant system is another area. And then, the shape and sizing options to do as precise of a patient matching as is possible, both preoperatively and intraoperatively, have all been value propositions that have resonated with the surgeon base. Also with the surgeons, we've received very good feedback on the instrumentation. So the design of these instruments are catered in a fashion that leads to a nice efficiency opportunity for the hospital, and so it can reduce sterilization cost. And so, that's a message that resonates with that stakeholder in the discussion, and it's meaningful economically for them. And then, the ergonomically designed instruments speak very well to the surgeons and help with the precise implantation of a system. And then, finally, when we're talking about the performance long term of the product and some of the differentiated technologies, we're incorporating our VIVACIT-E Highly Crosslinked bearing surface into the Persona System, and that one's a premium and we have great evidence scientifically to prove why that's a better bearing surface. And so that's led us to successful discussions in that regard. And then, ultimately, a cement-less knee is a coming attraction what Trabecular Metal technology incorporated in. So we're doing really well in these discussions, Matt, and finding a lot of interest among our legacy surgeons, competitive surgeons and finding nice success in the pricing discussion of the system to date.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "That's great. On the margins, Jim, I wanted to -- I know you got into this a little bit already and went through some detail, but I just wanted to clarify. It sounded like the delta in gross margins in the quarter and going forward, we have sort of an OSP-related mix hit. We have a geography-related hit on mix, delta and FX hedging and some E&O [ph] charges. And, first, does that -- are those the basic points for this quarter and going forward? And second, if you could talk maybe -- I don't know if you hit on proportions of what those are and maybe what -- how we should expect the trends to go the rest of the year, if that might be asking too much?", "James T. Crines", "Those are the right elements, Matt. And as I indicated, we are anticipating less pressure from excess on obsolete inventory charges on the back half of the year. As well, we're expecting more favorable hedge results as well as a more favorable shift toward higher-margin products, as we get deeper into the launch of Persona. And the mix of revenue within the surgical business shifts more towards, sort of, a better balance as between the capital sales and disposable sales. As far as the -- what those sort of various pressures, those various components that I spiked out were -- in terms of how they were impacting in the second quarter, I've, without getting too detailed, just indicated that the product mix and inventory charges accounted for the majority of that pressure in the second quarter and geographic mix less -- had a negative impact, but less of an impact than the other 2 components.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "And just -- so to color on the OSP-related, I mean, is this a matter of you've launched the product and you're sort of loading, if you will, accounts with the capital side of the razor side of the razor blade, if you will. And as the blade consumption, kind of, picks up across these accounts, the margins will kind of start to pick back up? Is that the thinking?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, generally, that is the dynamic. I mean, the capital equipment margin is a lower margin than the annuity that flows from the disposables. So as you place those units, your mix of revenues will rebalance over time and the higher margin will become more prominent.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "It's Steve Beuchaw here, stepping in for David. I just had 1 for housekeeping question first and then a couple on the markets. Jim, I wonder if you could give us any sense of whether there was a material impact anywhere of any selling day irregularities year-on-year and, maybe, if you could, any sense for which geographies or product lines where they might have been more impactful?", "James T. Crines", "Okay. So the -- yes, I think we pointed this out on our last call. We did have an extra selling day in the quarter, and we'll have an extra selling day in the third quarter as well, but not across all geographies. So to the extent it was not across all geographies, in our case, it only contributed less than 1 point, somewhere between 0.5 points to 1 point within the quarter.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And then, David, on the U.S. ortho market, one of your competitors not only made comments that are pretty similar to yours, indicating more or less that markets are steady, if not slightly improving on an underlying basis or went so far as to say it doesn't seem like we are seeing in 2013 the summer slowdown in the U.S. that we've seen over the last 2 or 3 years. Would you echo those views about what's going on in U.S. hips and knees?", "David C. Dvorak", "Well, I think, from what we saw in Q2, it's a performance in the market that I think is pretty consistent with general trends over the last several quarters. I mean, there are blips, up or down, from quarter-to-quarter as we've discussed in the past. We saw a bit of a step-up in Q4 of 2012, and then it looked like, at least in the case of knees within the U.S., a bit of a step-down in Q1 of 2013. And then, that looks like it strengthened by 100 basis points from Q1 to Q2. But then, that just lands you back in what has been a pretty consistent range of a couple to 3% growth rate across the last many quarters. And I think that's the right way to think about the market.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "That's very helpful. And then, the last one on Europe, maybe putting a more positive spin on it. But if you follow the macro headlines, the consensus view seems to be that for Europe, broadly speaking, that austerity is probably not, and this is a broad generalization, probably not what that -- the continent wants to be doing with regard to policies around, let's call it, Spain, Portugal, Italy or maybe some of the peripheral countries, so maybe we'll get some relief of austerity. Some of our survey work would suggest that you're already seeing the signs that the things are bottoming out. I mean, in your view, is there a case to be made here that some of these peripheral countries that were early drags on growth in Europe could start to reverse over the next 12 months? And if so, what should we be looking at as the leading indicators?", "David C. Dvorak", "Well, I think that what you pose is quite possible, Steve, but it's -- it really is speculation to say that the macroeconomic conditions are going to trend in one direction or another. And there are people that have backgrounds and spent a lot more time studying and providing those forecasts than us. I would tell you, as it relates to the musculoskeletal market, the reason that I think we believe it's going to show some level of stability. It's just -- you can only push back on those on the procedure demand and defer those cases for so long before there's going to be some political unrest within the population base [ph]. So the aging population is what it is, that hasn't change. Yet the procedure rates started to tick down because there was a pullback in the allocation of resources to do those cases last year. I think, as we get deeper into 2013, there has to be some leveling off of that because those patients don't have other solutions. So just -- the core drivers for these markets don't melt away. They're still there. And at some point, there'll be enough of an active population base seeking knee solutions that have proven results to where -- the market will come back a bit. So especially in these developed markets, it looks like they stepped down pretty significantly as we got to the back half of 2012. I think that we'll see some stabilization in the second half of this year.", "Operator", "Question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.", "Robert Wisniewski - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "It's Rob in for Kristen. I wanted to touch on -- you saw a nice turnaround in Spine this quarter, a nice uptick in growth sequentially. Can you speak to the dynamics there and how much is that a Zimmer phenomenon and how much is that a market?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes. I think that, for us, we've seen sort of stabilization as it pertains to price, and I think a market that hasn't changed dramatically. The big difference maker is we're putting new products out the door, and that's fueling the improvements in our top line performance. And it's been a good number of quarters in the making. But the team there has been very focused, innovating in a relevant way, concentrating on the core fusion market, which is the lion's share of that $8 billion, $9 billion market that exists and delivering solutions that are responsive to what customers are seeking. So we're getting -- are blocking and tackling down and executing and starting to see the positive benefits of that with the right products coming out the door, a nice pipeline of future launches. I would also tell you that I think our commercial execution on the sales side is -- these guys have worked very hard, and we're finding traction and improving, and they're building the tailwind out within that network. So it's just the beginning of what we believe should be a positive trend in our performance, and it's the case across the globe. We had step-up in performances with more of the right products in the bag, o U.S. as well as within the United States, and saw sequential improvement in all 3 geographic segments.", "Robert Wisniewski - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Great. That's helpful. And looking at the U.S. trauma business, growth ticked down there sequentially. There's obviously a number of moving parts given Synthes [ph] and J&J. Can you just speak to the performance of that business and the dynamics in that market?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes. Well, we've had a very strong run for multiple quarters now, and our performance has been on a positive track and all 3 geographic segments continued on a positive track in the o U.S. segments. It's a product portfolio that we've built out over the last handful of years, and we feel like we have a very competitive offering at this point in time, only further short of by virtue of the NORMED acquisition. So there was a market opportunity that was somewhat unique in Q1. We shared in some of that opportunity, obviously. That kind of melted away in Q2, and we had some other Zimmer unique issues that we'll resolve and get back on track in the U.S. in the coming quarters. So it's a market that we think is quite attractive. We've made a lot of progress in building out the product portfolio and bringing emphasis to the sale of those products across all 3 geographic segments. And I think we just have more work to do in the U.S. jurisdiction, and we just want to continue the momentum o U.S. But we're going to be in good shape going forward in trauma.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Bill Plovanic with Canaccord.", "William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Just on the med device tax, could you quantify what the impact was in the quarter for that?", "James T. Crines", "As we pointed out before, we are anticipating somewhere in the order of $10 million to $15 million of charges, hitting cost of sales. I would -- and as we've also pointed out, the way we're accounting for that is as the tax gets paid, it gets capitalized in inventory and then will get released into the P&L if that inventory is sold. So there was virtually no impact in the P&L on the first half of the year. So neither the first or second quarters will -- as that inventory sort of works its way through the system, we'll begin to see some charges in the back half of the year.", "William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Great. I just wanted to clarify that. And then, on the hip business -- I mean, that was a nice turnaround. That business in the U.S. has been up a little past couple of quarters, down a little last quarter and you had a good quarter this quarter. Anything specifically driving that either in the U.S. or Asia-Pac?", "David C. Dvorak", "No. We have a competitive offering on the hip side and, generally, doing a pretty good job in all 3 jurisdictions. I think that we need to pick up the pace and improve in some of the big markets in Europe, but those are the markets that have been hit with the kind of across-the-board slowdowns. And so I'd expect us to be able to continue the overall performance, at least, at market growth rates and, hopefully, as the European market stabilized, to benefit from that because of our geographic mix within hips. But the technologies that we're driving are the right technologies. We're doing really well with the Continuum Cup. We got a broad stem offering. We like the prospects of the Avenir stem and are seeing really nice traction, particularly from surgeons that are interested in the Anterior Supine approach. And we have a nice pipeline coming too. So we're in good shape with respect to hips, as well as opportunities for intelligent instruments in that category.", "William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "And are you concerned at all with the sales force focused on knees and the Persona that you can maintain continued growth in the hip?", "David C. Dvorak", "We'll be able to maintain it. I mean, our core channel is focused on large joints. And so, you're right to be sensitive to it, and we will be sensitive to it. But we're going to look to ensure that we drive balance in those sales. Those are our 2 largest franchises. And so, much of the business is built around knees and hips.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "David, I wondered if we could just look at the dental business for a second. Growth maybe slowed down a couple of hundred basis points sequentially. You came up against a slightly easier comp. Is that just European market more than anything? Is there anything competitive in there? Just any color you could give would be helpful.", "David C. Dvorak", "Well, o U.S. market and not just Europe in that case, Jeff. I think that Japan in particular and what's happened as far as a bit of transformation within the marketplace in Korea has contributed to that as well.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "All right. And the Japanese headwinds have been going on for, what, now 3 or 4 quarters? Are we almost through most of those -- at least, anniversary-ing through those? Is that base of business down to kind of a defensible area here for you and probably the whole market?", "David C. Dvorak", "We keep looking for that. These have been challenging markets and probably markets that we talked about with price pressure and some of the different product categories and geographies in which we operate. I'd tell you, as it relates to dental, there had been some more fundamental transformations going on with deeper penetration by the value providers. And so, that's some of what you see in addition to the procedural pullback. And when you layer that dynamic on top of procedural pullback that's driven by the fundamental macroeconomic conditions, you'll start to be able to reconcile the growth rates across that market.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Understood. And then, just as a follow-up question, on the acquisition front, I just want to understand kind of, with NORMED, with Knee Creations and Dornoch will anniversary after this quarter. But in the quarter itself, maybe -- I think you talked about a $5 million run rate from acquisitions. Is that about what you're expecting the acquisition contribution in the back half of the year as well? I'm just trying to reconcile, kind of, relative to your updated guidance.", "David C. Dvorak", "I'd say it will be in a similar range because I think we get into Q4 before the Dornoch acquisition anniversaries out as opposed to Q3. So -- but you're talking about a couple of million dollar difference, one way or another, dependent upon when you snap up the line and they're looking for the revenues to anniversary out. None of those acquisitions are substantial in the way of acquired revenue run rates. They're all substantial by way of the opportunity and sort of the accretive nature if we execute them well. And to date, we have done just that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Matthew Keeler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "This is Matt in for Bruce. I just wanted to clarify, in response to an earlier question, I think you said Gel-One was closer to $5 million than $10 million. I'm just wondering, inclusive of all the items that were reclassified from surgical and other, is that around $10 million that went into the Americas knees in the second quarter? Or is it a little more? A little less?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes. We're not going to start parsing million dollar sections, Matt, of our -- it's our largest franchise. And so, any of those movements are not substantial in the context of our knee business, which is, round numbers, 40% of our overall business. So not substantial by the way of absolute revenue dollars. And the biggest contributor on year-over-year growth was Gel-One. And as I characterized that in response to the question of -- thinking of it as a range of $5 million to $10 million, I said that's the right range, and just between those 2 numbers, it's closer to the lower end of that range than the upper end of that range in Q2. But we're going to be cautious about getting into quarterly report-outs of single-digit million dollar revenue numbers. I hope you understand.", "Matthew Keeler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Sure, sure. And then, I guess, just on Knee Creations, can you maybe share your thoughts with us on the market opportunity for that product longer term, and when that could start to be a significant revenue generator?", "David C. Dvorak", "This is really an interesting technology and one that we're very excited about. I think that we obviously are looking at unmet clinical needs across our business, and knees is our largest business. And the satisfaction rates within knees, notwithstanding the terrific clinical performance as measured by lack of revision as an endpoint clinical marker, total knee replacements are going to continue to be very much in demand. But we're of a view that there are going to be opportunities to move upstream in the disease state, catch opportunities to provide a terrific patient solution earlier in the disease stage. And in that continuum of care, these early intervention strategies that we're putting together can be very, very meaningful in providing us a great benefit to patients in a cost-effective way. And as you can see, we've been assembling a portfolio of these solutions, including Gel-One, including DeNovo, including Chondrofix. And now, with the pick-up of Knee Creations and the Subchondroplasty technique and technologies and products, we believe it can be a big difference maker because the bone marrow edema pathology is one that we think is underestimated in the effect that it has on patients, and we need to build out the clinical proof points for that to ramp up, and that's likely to take some number of operating periods going forward. But this could be a very, very significant solution that ends up reshaping how some of these patients in earlier disease states are treated. So we're excited about it, and we'll look to make further investment to build out the clinical proof points to be able to pursue the expansion of that solution and offering to surgeons and patients globally.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "In order for gross margins to improve throughout the year, do you need the OSP uptake to slowdown?", "James T. Crines", "So we don't -- no, no, we don't need it to slow down at all, and we'll be more than happy to have it continue at the same pace we saw it at the second quarter. We, as you can understand, Joanne, were more than happy to have the absolute number in terms of gross margin growing at pace with the kind of top line growth we're seeing in the surgical products business. And if that weighs on the ratio, that's okay, to the extent that we're getting significant growth -- absolute growth in gross and -- gross margins and operating profit. It's just the case that -- that's why I pointed out we do expect this -- the mix to change a bit going forward. We were -- there were sort of very significant new customer capital installations that occurred over the course of the second quarter. And over time, as we get these this customer set up and the capital installed, naturally, we're going to be selling more of the higher-margin, single-use disposables relative to the capital.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "And then, the acquisitions you've been making lately have been what we would call the small tuck-in variety. Have you changed -- or could you refresh us on your M&A viewpoint?", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure, Joanne. I think our M&A viewpoint has not changed over time. We have rigorous return metrics that we apply to evaluate in any opportunity. And it just so happens that we've been able to identify and successfully execute on some of the smaller, kind of bolt-on and tuck-in acquisitions with products and technologies that have build out our portfolio and addressed anatomical site scenarios that we felt like we could further strengthen our portfolio and offerings. We would have an appetite, obviously, to do bigger transactions, but we're going to be very disciplined about the evaluation of those opportunities. And to the extent that we can identify a medium-sized or even a larger transaction that satisfies the return metrics that we apply to evaluating those opportunities, then we would put energy towards doing such a transaction. But I think that we would look at -- continue to at least to have a constant cadence of the kinds of deals that we've been doing for the last couple of -- 3 years on the M&A front.", "Operator", "And your final question comes from the line of Jason Wittes with Brean Capital.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "I wanted to ask about your pricing strategy with knees. There's quite a bit of differentiation in terms of, I guess -- I'd say, modularity in terms of whether that be Trabecular Metal or VIVACIT-E cups. But how does that play against a hospital that has capitated pricing? Does that mean that you just end up with more implants at the higher end of the spectrum, or are you able to sort of offset some of that capitation?", "David C. Dvorak", "Well, I mean, it -- we just, as they are, are doing a value analysis in those discussions. And so, there are going to be instances where, by virtue of the volume that's driven and the service requirements and the instrument deployments, which are not inconsequential on this business, all of those are factors that go into what price point we're going to take those kinds of technologies into a particular system or individual facility. But there's obviously a structure and a rationale to how we position our systems and the technologies, and we have the benefit, frankly, of having a broad enough portfolio to where we're able to position our products and systems in a way that they can address about any customers' wants, needs and desires in that regard, Jason.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So in other words, there are some negotiations that still happens, and you're able to sort of come to the table with both an increased service offering plus, it sounds like, some clinical backing to some of the differentiation in your knees. Is that fair to say?", "David C. Dvorak", "That's exactly right. There will continue to be negotiation in those discussions. And I think that the onus is on us, as we've described in the past, increasingly to provide empirical proof of the superiority of any new technology or system that we're launching as well to innovate in a way that is helping those customers address their concerns for delivering excellent patient outcomes in a very cost-effective way. So that is something that is embedded in any R&D project that we scope out to ensure that we're delivering value on multiple fronts.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then, just quickly, in terms of the knee rollout, I assume that your -- there's still more to go in terms of rolling out. I mean, my understanding going through the year was that you'd start to see it this quarter, but it's really next 2 where you'd see a more -- the new knee in the hands of more surgeons. Is that the right way to think about it?", "David C. Dvorak", "It is. And I guess, I'd ask you to -- or encourage you to take a step back even further from that. This type of a system launch is a multi-operating period launch as opposed to just a multi-quarter within an operating period launch. So this is the first full year of the launch, and there will be several years of instrument deployments in the U.S. and o U.S. markets. And then, there are going to be phases of technologies in addition to that system to take place over multiple operating periods too. So it's one of the reasons, frankly, that we're so excited about the receptivity that we saw in the limited release last year in the general release as we broadened this year, is we just feel like we're on a terrific track at this point in time for multiple operating periods to go after competitive business and do great things for patients and take share. And that's what we're out to accomplish within the knee category.", "So I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today and your continued interest and support for Zimmer. We look forward to speaking to you on our third quarter conference call, which is scheduled for 8 a.m. on October 24. And with that, I'll turn the call back to you, Montserrat [ph].", "Operator", "And thank you, again, for participating in today's conference call.

I would like to turn the call over to Bob Marshall, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Marshall, you may begin your call.", "Robert J. Marshall", "Good morning, and welcome to Zimmer's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. I'm here with our CEO, David Dvorak, and our CFO Jim Crines.", "Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.", "Also, the discussions during this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included within the earnings release, which is available on our website at investor.zimmer.com.", "With that, I'll now turn the call over to David Dvorak.", "David C. Dvorak", "Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call for the third quarter of 2013. This morning, I'll review our third quarter financial results, providing commentary on the year's progress to date and highlights from our performance. Jim will then provide additional financial details. I'll state all sales in constant currency terms, and I'll discuss all earnings results on an adjusted basis.", "Zimmer accelerated top line growth in the third quarter with notable contributions across our core franchises. This growth was also driven by our innovative new product offerings, contributions from recently entered new product categories and the focused execution of our global sales teams. Consolidated net sales for the quarter were $1.07 billion, an increase of 6.7%, and our earnings per share were $1.25, an increase of 8.7% over the prior year period. We again delivered margin expansion through disciplined operating expense management and generated leveraged earnings per share, aided by our capital deployment strategy. Also in the quarter, Zimmer made additional investments to enhance all aspects of our quality management system. This focused work will continue into future quarters as part of our quality and operational excellence agenda. Additionally, the company remained committed to continuing to build stockholder value in the future by executing on our established growth initiatives and capital allocation programs. Our performance in the third quarter represents a validation of our ongoing business strategy, which will continue to serve as the company's guiding compass as we get capitalized on future growth opportunities.", "Turning to global market conditions. In the third quarter, musculoskeletal markets demonstrated stability with some improvements over recent quarters in certain geographies. With respect to pricing, we experienced pressure of negative 1.5% in the quarter, consistent with our expectations coming into the year.", "I'd now like to comment on our sales performance in each of our geographic segments. In the third quarter, Americas sales grew by 8.7% year-over-year; while Europe, Middle East and Africa increased by 0.9% and the Asia Pacific region grew 8.0%. In the quarter, the company continued to benefit from strategic investments in broadening our industry-leading product portfolio as well as strengthening our sales channel. These investments demonstrate our ongoing commitment to delivering a compelling value proposition to surgeons, their patients and health care institutions.", "Turning now to the results of our product categories. I'm extremely pleased to report that sales from our market-leading knee business increased in the third quarter by 7.4%, reflecting positive volume and mix of 9.1% and negative price of 1.7%. Our Americas segment reported an impressive sales increase of 9.1%, while Europe, Middle East and Africa grew sales by 1.3% and the Asia Pacific region delivered strong 9.0% growth compared with the previous year.", "In the third quarter, we were very encouraged by steady sales growth for Persona, the personalized knee system. As we continue to roll out this premium offering, we're receiving excellent feedback from both new and legacy clinician customers. Their testimonials powerfully illustrate why we believe the Persona system and its accompanying intelligent instrumentation represent the next generation of advancement in total knee replacement technology. The Persona system gives surgeons a new level of intraoperative precision to personalize the best fit for their patients. These high-fidelity implants, along with intelligent instrumentation designed to support the precision and intraoperative efficiency of the total knee replacement, have earned the enthusiastic endorsement of customers around the world. Ultimately, of course, we designed the Persona system with the needs of patients in mind. Promising early feedback from clinician customers continues to validate the design rationale behind Persona to allow patients to achieve unprecedented postoperative fit, feel and return to normal function. Our outlook therefore remains bullish for the future of this revolutionary knee system. The performance of our knee franchise in the third quarter was also supported by growing sales of Gel-One, Zimmer's single-injection treatment for early knee osteoarthritis and a major component of our exciting and growing early intervention and joint preservation offerings, which also include DeNovo NT, Chondrofix and Subchondroplasty.", "Turning to our hips business. In the third quarter, we achieved sales growth of 2.2%, reflecting positive volume and mix of 4.3% and negative price of 2.1%. Sales increased by 3.7% in the Americas, decreased by 2.1% in Europe, Middle East and Africa, and increased by 5.0% in the Asia Pacific region. A positive shift towards premium solutions in the United States such as our Continuum Acetabular System, VIVACIT-E liners and Biolux [ph] ceramic head offerings help support our increased revenues. In addition, the Avenir and Fitmore Hip Systems each delivered impressive global sales growth in the quarter. These competitively differentiated offerings are just a few of the many examples of how our portfolio closely matches patient anatomy and help surgeons achieve the best outcomes for their patients.", "Our Extremities business delivered strong 15% growth in the third quarter, with all geographic regions reporting what we believe to be above-market performances. Our sales continue to be driven by our highly successful shoulder replacement portfolio, led by the Trabecular Metal Reverse Shoulder. To complement this system in the quarter, we received 510(k) clearance to market the Zimmer Patient Specific Instruments shoulder, further strengthening our position in this rapidly growing segment of the shoulder arthroplasty market. This intelligent instrumentation technology leverages 3D visualization software to generate personalized surgical plans for each patient, utilizing Patient Specific Instruments guide to facilitate positioning of the implant, including precise reaming and screw placement. This innovative application of Zimmer's intelligent instrumentation platform further demonstrates how these cost-effective efficient solutions are enhancing our portfolio of differentiated technologies for the achievement of personalized patient outcomes.", "Dental sales experienced modest growth for the third quarter as the company continues to pursue opportunities in a mixed global market. Solid sales growth of 6.8% in the Americas was offset by continuing market challenges in Europe. We expect continued strong performance from our market-leading regenerative portfolio, premium Trabecular Metal Dental Implants and custom-milled Zfx CAD/CAM Digital Dentistry Solutions. We also look forward to the ongoing introduction of value-based offering designed in the P-I Br\u00e5nemark philosophy for certain international markets. As markets stabilize, we're confident our differentiated portfolio offers both premium and value-based offerings, which position Zimmer Dental for improved growth.", "Zimmer Trauma grew sales by 7.6% in the third quarter, with our Americas segment reporting a sales increase of 1.9%; Europe, Middle East and Africa growing sales by 15.9% and the Asia Pacific region delivering 12.0% growth. In certain key geographies, we benefited from investments into dedicated trauma sales teams to improve performance in top-tier traumatology centers. Product sales in the quarter were driven by steady results from our core plates and screws portfolio as well as another strong quarter for the Zimmer Natural Nail family. Further, the ongoing rollout of the XtraFix External Fixation System continues to gain market acceptance.", "In the quarter, we also garnered 510(k) clearance for the motion lock screw for Periarticular Locking Plate System, which has been designed to promote faster and stronger healing. Zimmer Spine sales decreased by 3.4% in the quarter compared to the prior year. We're generating encouraging growth internationally as we continue to add technologies and products that will increase our ability to compete in the U.S. market. Sales once again were led by our innovative core fusion portfolio, including the TM Ardis and TM-S Interbody Fusion Devices and the inViZia Anterior Cervical Plate System. Additionally, our minimally invasive solutions continue to show promising growth, led by the PathFinder NXT Pedicle Screw System. We're also making progress with our ongoing commercialization of the APEX Spine System for degenerative deformity and complex spinal conditions. Additionally, Zimmer Spine recently signed an exclusive global distribution agreement for the Lateral Locking Cage, a first of its kind minimally invasive lateral interbody cage. This deal marks Zimmer's -- Zimmer Spine's entry into lateral access surgeries, one of the fastest-growing segments of the global spine market.", "In the third quarter, Zimmer's surgical and other category continued to deliver outstanding performance with a 24.7% sales increase over the previous year. Our Americas surgical business delivered exceptional 35.9% growth, in addition to above-market performances internationally. The Transposal fluid waste management system again led our strong performance in the third quarter. Patient care solutions and capital sales for our power tools remain drivers of growth in Europe, while our legacy surgical portfolio continues to deliver solid performance in the Asia Pacific region.", "With that, I'll now ask Jim to provide further details on the third quarter and our updated guidance. Jim?", "James T. Crines", "Thank you, David. I will review our third quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our 2013 sales and earnings guidance. Our total revenues for the third quarter were $1,074,000,000, a 6.7% constant currency increase compared to the third quarter of 2012. Net currency impact for the quarter decreased revenues by 1.9% or $20 million. The negative currency impact for the quarter related principally to our Japanese yen and Australian dollar denominated revenues, partially offset by positive currency translation associated with our euro-based revenues.", "Our adjusted gross profit margin was 73.5% for the quarter. The margin ratio declined 160 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2012. This quarter's adjusted gross margin ratio was slightly improved compared with our second quarter results. In the third quarter, we continued to experience a higher mix of lower-margin product and geographic revenues, as well as manufacturing-related charges. Together with the slight year-over-year decline in price, these headwinds outweighed foreign currency hedge gains and cost savings from our operational excellence initiatives. In the quarter, while we again realized significant growth in sales of the capital component of the Transposal fluid waste management system, we are beginning to see a more balanced contribution coming from the higher-margin single-use disposable components utilized with the capital. We would expect this trend to continue to evolve in coming quarters.", "The company's R&D expense decreased 7.8% or $4 million on a reported basis to 4.6% of net sales when compared to the prior year. As noted in prior quarters, the decrease in R&D expense continues to reflect a natural decline related to the completion of a number of large projects, as well as the dedication of resources to our quality and operational excellence initiatives. Our internal resources working together with outside experts are laying the foundation for enhanced design, development and manufacturing processes. This is a key next step in our drive to achieve a higher level of excellence in these areas. At the same time, Zimmer's pipeline of new and innovative products remains robust, which will help pace growth in future periods.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses were $438 million in the third quarter, and at 40.8% of sales, were 110 basis points below the prior year. In the quarter, savings from our transformation initiatives were partially offset by increased selling, marketing and distribution costs associated with the commercialization of a number of new products, as well as direct sales integration in certain key markets.", "In the quarter, the company reported pretax charges of $46.4 million in special items and $43.8 million in cost of products sold pertaining to global restructuring, quality and operational excellence initiatives, certain litigation and recent acquisitions. Our adjusted results exclude the impact of these charges, which include $39.1 million associated with a broad-based product rationalization program; $33 million related to quality and operational excellence initiatives in manufacturing, logistics and sales; $12 million connected with certain litigation and $6.1 million in integration and other costs. Product rationalization will aid in the achievement of our quality and manufacturing excellence goals, as well as reduce inventory requirements in future periods.", "Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to $301.9 million. At 28.1%, our adjusted operating profit to sales ratio was 10 basis points higher than the prior year third quarter. Net interest expense for the quarter amounted to $13.3 million, which was favorable when compared to the prior year quarter. Adjusted net earnings were $215.6 million for the third quarter, an increase of 6.7% compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8.7% to $1.25 on 172.2 million average outstanding diluted shares. These adjusted earnings per share are inclusive of approximately $0.04 of share-based compensation. At $0.90, reported diluted earnings per share decreased 11.8% from the prior year third quarter reported EPS of $1.02.", "Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.4% and was 50 basis points favorable when compared to prior year. Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.3%, as the majority of restructuring and other special items charges are incurred in higher-taxed jurisdictions.", "During the quarter, we repurchased 0.2 million shares at a total purchase price of $17.5 million. Approximately $536 million of authorization remains under our share repurchase program that runs through December 31, 2014. The company had approximately 170.5 million shares of common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2013, down from 173.5 million as of September 30, 2012. Additionally, 1.6 million stock options were exercised in the quarter, resulting in $108.7 million of cash proceeds. Through the end of the third quarter, 5 million stock options had been exercised in 2013, resulting in $325.4 million of cash proceeds. In contrast, on average, less than 1 million stock options were exercised in each of the last 3 years. As a result, the company now estimates diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the full year to be approximately 171.5 million shares. The higher expected share count resulting from the unusually high volume of option exercises this year causes us to modify our outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share from a range of $5.70 to $5.80 to the low end of that range or approximately $5.70.", "Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $297 million, a decrease of 13.9% from $345.1 million in the third quarter of 2012. The decrease is driven in part by the ongoing build-out of inventory in support of new products, the impact of the medical device excise tax, as well as increased cash outflows associated with certain claims, restructuring actions and quality and operational excellence initiatives. Net inventories were $1,082,000,000 at the end of the third quarter, an increase of $29 million from June 30, 2013.", "Adjusted inventory days on hand finished the quarter at 284 days, flat as compared to the prior quarter. As of the end of the third quarter, net receivables increased $899 million from $875 million in the third quarter of 2012 or 3% over prior year. Our adjusted trade accounts receivable days sales outstanding finished the quarter at 73 days, an increase of 1 day when compared with the prior year.", "Depreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter amounted to $91.9 million. Free cash flow in the third quarter was $206 million, $75.4 million lower than the third quarter of 2012. We define free cash flow as operating cash flow less cash outlays for instruments and property, plant and equipment. The decrease in free cash flow reflects the ongoing investments in our new product inventory, capacity-related investments and the acquisition and deployment of instruments to support the full release of Persona and other new products. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $90.8 million, including $49.8 million for instruments and $36.9 million for property, plant and equipment.", "I'd like to turn now to our guidance for 2013. In our earnings release this morning, we updated our sales guidance, noting that the company expects full year of 2013 revenues to increase approximately 4.5% constant currency when compared to 2012. Previously, we had estimated full year revenues would increase between 4% and 5% constant currency. We now expect foreign currency translation to decrease our reported 2013 revenues between 1.5% and 2% for the full year. Therefore, on a reported basis, our revenues are projected to be between 2.5% and 3% above 2012 results. Previously, we had estimated foreign currency translation would decrease revenues by approximately 2%.", "Our earnings release also indicates that our full year 2013 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance has been modified to approximately $5.70. To arrive at our anticipated reported GAAP earnings per share, you should subtract total charges for inventory step-up and other inventory and manufacturing-related charges, certain claims and special items of $335 million pretax or approximately $1.30 per share on an after-tax basis.", "Our gross margin ratio is now expected to be at or slightly below 74% for the full year. R&D as a percentage of revenue was still expected to be approximately 4.5% for the full year. SG&A guidance as a percentage of revenue remains unchanged at approximately 39.5%. We expect interest expense for the full year to be approximately $56 million.", "Moving down the income statement, we now expect the 2013 full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 25.5%. And as indicated, our average diluted share cap for the year is expected to be approximately 171.5 million shares. Finally, please note that our guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or other unforeseen events.", "David, I'll turn the call back over to you.", "David C. Dvorak", "Thanks, Jim. Zimmer's strong performance in the Americas and Asia Pacific geographies, as well as in several key product categories, contributed to our accelerated top line growth in the third quarter. These results continue to validate the company strategy for growth, quality and operational excellence and disciplined capital management while groundbreaking new offerings, such as Persona, the personalized knee system, continue to build our profile as the world leader in reconstructive orthopedic technologies. Our expansion into early intervention solutions and adjacent product categories is extending our reach across the continuum of musculoskeletal care. We're confident that these critical elements of our value creation framework will help support our continued growth.", "And now, I'd like to ask Toni to begin the Q&A portion of our call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "[indiscernible] seems to be going very well in the United States and how you're approaching that through your current physician base versus new physicians?", "David C. Dvorak", "Joanne, I think that you came in a little bit delayed. Do you mind repeating the question, please?", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Of course. I wanted to talk about your knee sales in the United States, which were much stronger than we had expected. I wanted to understand the Persona launch in the United States, and what percentage of that is coming from current physicians versus new physician trials?", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure. We're excited about the success of that launch. And probably the most exciting thing is that it's still early in the process of such a large system launch. As you know, these things roll out with -- paced by instrument sets. And those deployments take time and it'll be multiple operating periods. And furthermore, there are technologies that will be integrated into that system in a phased approach as part of our multiyear generational product development plan. So there are more great things to come under the Persona umbrella. To date, it's been a balance of a mix of legacy Zimmer clinicians that have come from NexGen use or NK II use, as well as competitive surgeons. I would tell you that the competitive surgeon usage is not insignificant even at this stage in time. If you look at -- we're not going to break out in a detailed way the percentage of units or revenues that are flowing from those different sources. But rest assured that we're tracking that and deploying a very careful and methodical strategy as it relates to that mix. If you look at where we started the year, particularly on the U.S. knee performance side of things to where we progressed in the third quarter, it's pretty apparent that not all of that could possibly, by way of improvement, come from mere mix and premium charge by transitioning legacy Zimmer surgeons over to the Persona system. So there's a healthy portion of that acceleration coming from competitive surgeons.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Terrific. If I can squeeze in a follow-up. Can you just give a brief update on Europe? That seems to be the weaker of the 3 -- or the weakest of the 3 geographies. And how do we fix that?", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure. I mean, we address the macroeconomic conditions, so I'm happy to fix that geography. I think that it continues to be a slow geography particularly in several of the developed markets, and we have a large presence in those markets, market share-wise. So that makes it difficult for us to post the kind of numbers that we had been posting over the last several years. As those developed markets slow down, we continue to do very well in the developing markets. And then our performance within the primary 5 developed markets within Europe is a bit mixed. I would tell you that there are certain of them where we're doing well, others where we have more work to do. And I think that we've got the right plan in place to accelerate our performance. Obviously, within the product categories, we're going to put a lot of energy towards improving our hip performance in the coming quarters. But I think we have the right portfolio, the right leadership and the right strategic plans to make those improvements in the coming quarters.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Plovanic with Canaccord Genuity.", "William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "If I could, the contribution from Gel-One into the U.S. business in the quarter?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes. We're not going to break out that contribution. But relative to the category growth, it's not material.", "William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Okay. And just your thoughts, just a broader view here, just we've seen acquisitions in this space with Stryker buying Mako, and some talk about bicruciate sparing knees. Just kind of your thoughts on that longer term.", "David C. Dvorak", "Well, I think it's a whole category of bringing technologies, both for preoperative and interoperative purposes, to advance the outcome of these procedures is a valid one. And I think if anything, the deals that are getting announced support the strategy that we've been executing over the last half dozen or more years, and that is to develop implant systems that are much more personalized that offer broader options in a clinically relevant way. And part of what will enable the deployment of those systems are these preoperative and intraoperative technologies that can lead to more precise planning beforehand, more precise implantation, alignment soft tissue balancing in the OR, and address the patient satisfaction opportunity that is out there particularly in the knee category. So the major premise is sound now and people can take a different course on that ocean. And the course that we take and then continue to believe in is that something that is technologically advanced but sort of smaller, faster, cheaper is going to be the winning path towards success in that environment. And if you look at our internal and external development efforts over the last many years, they've combined to produce a really nice portfolio of preoperative and interoperative technologies that include portal technologies for digital templating and planning that include the ISS system, that is a guidance system that is used interoperatively; the eLIBRA system for soft tissue balancing; Patient Specific Instruments and all of those systems are integrated into the launch of an advanced total joint opportunity in the context of Persona. And you can see what we're doing with that even in the early stages. So again, I think that the opportunity and the clinical need is out there. Doing that, addressing that need and creating broader portfolio of opportunities, to personalize solutions in the hands of surgeons without dis-intermediating those surgeons, is where we're headed and we're well on our way towards addressing that need. So we're excited about this space. We think that there is room for innovation, and we think it's going to be a difference maker. The key is we're deploying strategies that we're confident are going to be not only clinically relevant and address that need but to do it in a cost-effective way.", "William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "And on the bicruciate sparing, do you -- just general thoughts there.", "David C. Dvorak", "Again, I think that's very consistent with our continuum of care approach. We've assembled again through internal and external development earlier intervention strategies. And we want to be the most comprehensive provider of solutions to the extent that one can. We have a leading product in the Uni category. And the bicruciate concept is really an extension of Uni that is to address any of the 3 compartments of the knee that are diseased and to do it in the most bone-conserving and tissue-sparing way. So the concept is absolutely consistent with our continuum of care and comprehensive approach and philosophy. And you should assume that anything that we believe is going to work from a clinical standpoint, we're either working on internally or looking at externally.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Taylor with Barclays Capital.", "Daniel Sollof - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "It's actually Dan, in for Matt. Just quick first to ask about the general market. I mean, in the past quarters, you've indicated stability. This quarter, you talked about missed stability and then some I guess potential improvement. Just -- can you comment on anything you're seeing in the market that led you to indicate that?", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure. I just -- obviously, the unit growth that we're seeing is an acceleration. And we're -- in the knee category, it's picked up on a global basis or all-in accelerated. But the majority of that acceleration for us at least came out of the U.S. marketplace. And a little bit of that is challenging to disaggregate because we believe that we're taking share by surgeon customers with the Persona launch. But again, the market is healthy within our existing and legacy accounts as well. Hips look like they picked up as well on a global basis or as an all-in number. And that acceleration looks like it was spaced out geographically within and outside the U.S. both.", "Daniel Sollof - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Great, that's helpful. And then just one quick follow-up on the EPS guidance. So the most items that you called out in the release and on the call take us the GAAP number. I mean, the adjusted number comes down a little bit also and not -- I'm just curious, so is that I guess -- [indiscernible] some of that is that the like inventory step-up I guess from the new product rollouts given the strong product cycle, or is there anything else there to put into?", "James T. Crines", "Yes, this is Jim. That's really a function of the updated guidance on the average diluted share count for the full year, raising that share count to 171.5 million shares. That compares with the guidance that we provided very early in the year of about 170 million shares. And as I've looked at most of the analyst models that are out there, it seems to me that, that's where most of them still sit. But outside of that, we continue to drive operating leverage. The guidance, with respect to what's going on above the P&L in terms of top line, obviously, that guidance relative to where we are in the beginning of the year is now at the top end of the range we provided early in the year. We feel very good about the progress. We continue to make the drive operating leverage even in the face of lower gross margin ratio which is, as we've talked about, a function of what's happening with both the geographic and product mix of revenues we're seeing this year. So again, I mean, when you look at a top line growth of 4.8%, we're driving 5.3% growth in operating profit, 6% growth in pretax earnings, 6.7% growth in net earnings. We're just seeing less leverage from the share repurchase program than we had expected to see coming into the year, because we're seeing option exercises that are frankly 5x the average annual number of option exercises we had seen in the preceding 3-year period.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So 2 questions, one on gross margin and one on share count. Just real quickly on share count. I was curious why wouldn't you be more aggressive with your buyback to offset the options?", "James T. Crines", "Well, as we pointed out, Bob, we have taken in $325 million on the exercise to those options. And it is something that certainly we would give -- had given consideration to, we'll continue to give consideration to. We may very well choose to get more aggressive on the share repurchase program as a way to offset the impact obviously those option exercises are having on earnings per share. We haven't done that at this point, but obviously it's still an opportunity that we have going forward.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Do that mean there's potential acquisitions being contemplated? Is that a read-through?", "James T. Crines", "I wouldn't make any assumptions. As I said, we've taken in quite a bit of money from the cash proceeds from those option exercises. And among other things, we'll consider getting more aggressive with the share repurchases. We'll -- as we have and continued to look for other opportunities as well to invest that capital. We've done a number of bolt-on acquisitions over the past couple of years. We're still very actively looking for opportunities to expand the portfolio so long as we can find things at the right price that fit within our focus on musculoskeletal health.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And then on gross margin, this is the second quarter in a row now where you've had to lower the gross margin guidance. And so first of all, from a big-picture perspective, I know there's a lot of moving parts here, and you articulated those last quarter. And the med tech tax going forward is going to be a bigger hit. Sounds like you think you're going to end the year a little bit below 74%. When you take into consideration all the moving parts that will affect gross margin, that are affecting it now and will affect it in the future, is this a line item that you can generate leverage on as we look to 2014, just in light of the, again, the 2 lowerings of guidance here? I'm just curious if you could give us any preliminary thoughts on whether you think from the high 73% whether there's leverage going forward into 2014 as we think about all the puts and takes.", "James T. Crines", "Sure. So on the last call, we had indicated an expectation that for gross margin, the gross margin ratio that will be at or slightly above 74%. That was predicated on a set of assumptions with respect to mix of revenues, the anticipated hedge gains and all the other factors that impact on margin. Our updated guidance now, which is at or slightly below 74%, reflects the updated outlook that we've now provided on currency, which has come down a little bit relative to where we were last quarter, as well as our latest expectations with respect to mix of revenues and other factors. I can tell you that the kind of things that will provide us with the opportunity to get leverage on margin ratio going forward, one thing would be to sustain the performance that we're seeing within our highest-margin portfolio. That's our knee portfolio, particularly as we see the kind of growth we're seeing in developed markets, where we tend to have higher margins, markets like the U.S., Japan, Australia where we're seeing really healthy growth with that knee franchise. We will, in the short term have to, just given the way we're accounting for the medical device excise tax, absorb what will amount to somewhere in the neighborhood of approximately $10 million a quarter in charges. That's not fully reflected in this year's gross margin. That would be fully reflected obviously in next year's gross margin. One of the things I'd like to take into account as we develop our operating plans for 2014. As far as beyond 2014, when we do get that fully reflected in our margin ratio, we absolutely believe there's opportunity to get leverage on the margin line, particularly again with the kind of performance we're seeing within our highest-margin franchise.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. So just to be clear, in 2014, you think there's more tailwinds than headwinds relative to where you're going to end up for 2013 when it comes to gross margin?", "James T. Crines", "I'm just not prepared today to really get into what our expectations are for the margin ratio for 2014. That's something we will address on our next call.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Craig W. Bijou - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "It's actually Craig, on for Larry. First question, at recent investor conferences, you said Dornoch sales were about $20 million in Q2. Just wanted to see -- -- should we assume that sales during this quarter were the same? And then how should we think about Dornoch sales going forward? Is it peaking in Q3 given the mix of capital and disposables? And I guess what's the view -- would it potentially be a drag on growth in 2014?", "James T. Crines", "Well, I don't want to get into too much detail on giving product line revenue guidance. But I will say that the peak was really Q2, not Q3. We saw still obviously a very healthy growth with within that surgical products business in the third quarter. We continue to make very good progress in penetrating new accounts with that product line. We saw a better mix of revenues between capital and the single-use disposables in the third quarter. That's something that, as we said on the call, we expect it's going to continue to evolve. The comps do get a little tougher as we get into the fourth quarter. And we closed that acquisition early in the fourth quarter of last year. And certainly, the comps are going to get tougher as we get into 2014.", "Craig W. Bijou - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just a general follow-up on 2014 growth. Can you talk about any puts and takes on the business and any major product launches?", "David C. Dvorak", "We can't talk about that, Craig. We can talk about that in January when we give you specific guidance on 2014. We're going through, at this point in the year and obviously doing a lot of work on the operating plan to lock that down. And we're extraordinarily excited about the new product pipeline. We rattled through some of the opportunities that we have by category. Obviously, Persona is going to continue to be a big driver for growth and probably the single most significant driver for growth. But that, coupled with our intelligent instrumentation launches will be -- continue to be the theme within the knee category. Joint preservation, earlier intervention, will obviously include continuing to take share with products like Gel-One, our premium products that are already launched on the hip side such as VIVACIT-E, as we described. We're really excited about the Avenir hip stem within that product category as well and the opportunity to get after some of the interior and anterior lateral procedural approaches within hips. We've got a bunch of new products out, Extremities via internal and external acquisitions, including the Trabecular Metal Total Ankle, our NORMED foot and ankle product lines. The same NORMED portfolio on the hand and wrist side is augmenting our trauma offering. And then within spine, both through internal and external development, a whole host of products that are launching, have launched. And then dental, executing on some of the opportunities that we have with the TM dental implant, Zfx Digital Dentistry Solutions. And we just spoke about the fluid waste management on the surgical side, but also expanding the launch of the universal power tools in that portfolio. So a lot of launches that are ongoing, some that will be new to 2014. But I think that you should expect to see a pretty consistent cadence going forward. And what all that rolls up to, let us finish the lockdown on the operating plan and come back to in January, okay?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.", "Kimberly Weeks Gailun - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "It's Kim here for Mike. A couple -- I guess a couple questions for us, just a follow-up on the gross margin side. Just as we look sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter, how -- I guess what's driving -- when you think within your guidance for the flat to slightly down for the year, you have to be looking for still a pretty nice sequential step-up third quarter to fourth quarter. I assume most of that is the FX piece. Could you break out just what the FX impact was on gross margin here in the third quarter, and what you think that looks like in the fourth?", "James T. Crines", "I can give you some idea, Kim. This is Jim. When you look at year-over-year, which is how we typically look at it, the hedge gains that we're running through cost of goods in the quarter relative to hedge losses that we had experienced last year, provide a boost of somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 to 60 basis points in the gross margin ratio, and the fourth quarter gets a little better than that. I would tell you the more significant contributor to our expectations with respect to the fourth quarter is the continuing progress that we're making with the new product launches. And again, these -- we're talking about most significantly Persona and the impact that, that has on our gross margin ratio as we see higher growth of again a high-margin product within a developed -- within our developed markets where we tend to have higher gross margins, as well as the mix with respect to the surgical products continuing to move towards higher-margin disposables versus the lower-margin capital sales, which really dominated the surgical products revenue growth in the second and third quarters.", "Kimberly Weeks Gailun - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, great. So -- I mean, so that comment would probably also suggest that the Persona momentum that you're seeing in the fourth quarter is pretty solid, if you think that kind of increase as a percentage of the mix?", "James T. Crines", "We -- as we talked about with respect to our third quarter results, very pleased, as David said with the progress we're making. And we expect to sustain the momentum as we get into the fourth quarter.", "Kimberly Weeks Gailun - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up to -- on the acquisition front and uses of cash, just curious. As you think about deals and the company's cash position and just kind of internal capacity, how do you think about the capacity of Zimmer to do larger type deals?", "James T. Crines", "We've always said, Kim, and our strategy hasn't changed with respect to M&A. One, we're going to remain focused on musculoskeletal health. Two, we need to take a very disciplined approach in it, looking at any other opportunity, making sure that whatever price we'll have to pay is going to provide us with the opportunity to get to a certain level of return on invested capital within a reasonable time frame. We have -- it is the case that we find more of those opportunities when we look on -- when we look at both smaller sort of bolt-on transactions because of the way that we can leverage the sales channel, the global sales channel infrastructure that we have, putting these products that we acquire into our global sales channels and leveraging the existing relationships we have with orthopedic, generally orthopedic surgery customers. We're not opposed to doing a large deal. We'd consider it but, again, those same disciplines are going to apply.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Just to start out with in terms of your -- the sales acceleration, a very nice sales acceleration that you saw this quarter. I believe you had an extra day in the quarter as well. So could you give us some sense for how much that contributed? And then as we look to next quarter, I know your guidance implies a bit of a deceleration from what we saw this quarter. How much of that is just a selling day versus Dornoch acquisition versus any other drivers for that expected sort of deceleration?", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure, Derrick. I think that on a consolidated basis globally, there was not a full billing day. But when you work through the weighting of it, there was sort of 0.5 billing day all in. And you can calculate that out to be something in the range of 0.5 point of the growth that you saw. So obviously, that doesn't carry into the Q4. I think Jim, Jim outlined one of the categories that obviously we'll anniversary as we get into the fourth quarter with the growth rate that we've been seeing out of the surgical business. And there are some others, but we would expect to continue the overall momentum and progress that we're making within all of these product categories. And would expect in particular to see continued good performance coming out of the 2 main geographies that we saw in the third quarter, that is the Americas and Asia Pacific.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And as a follow-up, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about how the Gel-One launch is going. Last quarter, you kind of had that in the $5 million to $10 million range. I presume from your comments that we're still kind of in that $5 million to $10 million range in sales. But how do we -- at what point does it kind of break out from that range? And can you talk a little bit about where you are in putting the distribution channels in place and just overall adoption in the category?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes. It's a good question, and we are in that range that you described. And within that range, pretty consistent relative to second quarter, but we're making progress in establishing the various elements of the distribution channel. It just needs to be viewed as a multiyear process to establish those channels. Because there's a cadence to that throughout the operating year to get on and get the opportunity for scripts to get written and to get on the preferred list within some of those networks. And so that is going to be a multiyear process for us. I think that the launch is going well relative to our plans and our expectations. And we continue to believe that there's going to be a nice opportunity for us for multiple operating periods going forward to help generate growth.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "It's Steve Beuchaw here, in for Dave. Jim, I wonder if you could take a step back and give us a sense for where we are within the context of the broader operational excellence program, the $400 million savings program? Are we roughly halfway there? Maybe not quite halfway there? And how does the savings trend going forward? I believe it's through '16. Is it ratable or are we accelerating, decelerating from here?", "James T. Crines", "Sure. So we came into the year with an expectation that we would generate about $80 million of incremental savings on top of what we had already achieved in the prior 2 periods. And in the prior 2 periods, we were at about $120 million run rate. So we made good progress with this year's initiatives and do expect to exit the year where we thought we would be, which is somewhere in the neighborhood of just over $200 million of savings towards that $400 million target. It is the case that in this operating period and, again, this is something.", "[Audio Gap]", "We'll look as we work our way through the development of our final operating plan for next year that within the operating period some of those savings may get reinvested in support of new product launches, building out some of the sales -- dedicated sales support for some of these new", "product categories that we're getting into. But we continue to feel very good about the $400 million -- our ability to deliver on the $400 million target that we've set for 2016. As to how that's going to pace out between now and 2016 and how much of that we're going to see in 2014, it'd be in a better position to address that once we have locked down on the 2014 operating plan. And again, we'll be providing that, some of that detailed guidance on our next call.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Got it. And then one for David. David, I wonder if you can help us think about some of the -- I don't want to -- I want to call it concerns, that might be an overstatement, out there around physician reimbursement into 2014. There are some who think that there might be a reduction to the rates that are paid to surgeons for hip and knee surgeries. Could you give us the Zimmer perspective on that possibility? How likely is it? And if it does happen, does it matter?", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure. We are familiar with the reference that you make to what may happen in the physician Medicare payment rule-making. I would tell you that to start with, what is rumored to be contemplated by way of a process in an administrative law context is pretty questionable. I think that the idea of those rule-making processes is to ensure that those administrative agencies follow a level of transparency and if there's an opportunity to be heard to ensure that whatever rules are promulgated are in the interest of the various constituencies that they are intending to serve. So the concept of a rate reduction coming sort of in the 11th hour in a way that has not been fully vetted through that rule-making processes is certainly disturbing, just by way of a process. I think that causes me to have faith that, that would not occur in the manner that's rumored. But no one can have absolute assurance that it wouldn't happen if it were to happen. Again, you're into another layer of speculation as to what the effect would be. I don't think it would be helpful to patients that are in need of these solutions. I don't think it would be helpful to attracting the next generation of surgeons. But whether or not that would have a quantifiable impact on the procedure rate is subject to, as I've stated, several layers of speculation. So I don't really know how to characterize that at this point in time. And I continue to have faith that people are going to follow a process that makes more sense than, under the cover of darkness, promulgating some substantial reduction to the reimbursement rates for the surgeons that perform these procedures.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "So a lot to talk about is -- and maybe drilling into the knee numbers just a little bit and sort of your progress there. I mean, it looks like some of the best growth numbers we've seen in 6 or 7 years, so congratulations on that launch.", "David C. Dvorak", "Thank you.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Taking a look at -- understanding that there's an opportunity that you're seeing materialize on the competitive front. Maybe as we've struggled through the last several years and seem to have the growth rate has dipped pretty significantly and now kind of heading back up, I think along the way we've all sort of guessed that where growth could be here, how far are we into the recovering volumes in total joint reconstruction? Is this something that you feel like sort of we're back and we're stable and this is kind of the market is where the market is? Or I'd love to get your thoughts on what you see for further improvements or what ought to be out there in terms of kind of patients have deferred over the years and so on. And then I have one follow-up for Jim.", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure, Matt. I think the quarter that we saw, at least as it relates to the Americas and Asia Pacific markets, are consistent with the range of opportunity that I think most people have seen, just by sheer math of the aging patient population within those markets and the need for these procedures, probably whatever the dynamics are, whether it's a perspective of stability within the economy or other behavioral drivers to go ahead and get the procedure done. And as we've seen the knee procedure rate has been a little bit more volatile from quarter-to-quarter than maybe hips. And there's some reasons for that, that make good sense as far as the pain characteristics for those patients that will drive that. So I think that what we saw in those markets is in fact consistent with the opportunity and the need from a patient perspective. Whether or not that's going to be sustained in a perfect manner in subsequent quarters is sort of anyone's guess at this point, frankly. And it's just something that we're going to continue to monitor very carefully. I think that there is opportunity to accelerate just by sheer demand and need within the EMEA market going forward.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Great. And then just in terms of understanding that you do an awful lot of your own manufacturing and have for some time. I'd love to get a sense of 2 things maybe. And I don't know if you're willing to share where you are in terms of utilization and/or potentially kind of like run rates and sort of opportunity for just your highest-margin businesses as you produce more implants off of your manufacturing base. And looking out, I guess a follow-up on the restructuring, also kind of relevant to margins and leverage. Jim, if you could characterize what opportunities are out there in terms of inventories and optimizing the way that you're delivering these things to the market.", "James T. Crines", "Sure. I don't know if I can tell you for sure. I'm not going to be able to give you a very detailed response to that question, Matt. As we've said in response to the couple of other questions, we're right now working our way through the operating plan for 2014. And some of what you're probing at, we're certainly going to be examining in great detail as we develop the operating plan for 2014. And we'll be able to provide at a high level at least some guidance in response to questions when we provide 2014 guidance on our next call. The -- certainly, the growth we're seeing in volumes. It's going to provide us with some opportunity to leverage our fixed costs across our manufacturing networks. The -- that in combination with all the work that we have still to do frankly on the operational excellence, as part of the operational excellence initiative that is focused on both our quality systems and our manufacturing processes, will ultimately drive down our -- we believe will ultimately put us in a position to be able to produce in a more reliable fashion, in a more consistent fashion, components that will likely be lower unit costs. But there's still a lot of work to do on that front. It is without a doubt the most complex of all of our innovate and improve initiatives. But we have assembled a very strong team with we feel the right kind of expertise to be working through those changes and look forward to the day when, as I said, we're going to have more streamlined, more efficient, higher-quality processes that are going to lead to, as I said, lower unit costs as well. So not only will we be able to take advantage of the opportunity of higher volumes across the network but we believe more efficient and better quality processes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So I just want to touch on the spine market. Sales were low. I think they are down 3%. There's been some disruptions there from mergers and larger competitors, and a lot of number of other players in the space is seeing a benefit. So can you speak to the dynamics there? And can you compare and contrast that to what you're seeing in trauma?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes. I think that the spine market for us obviously, that's a -- it's a smaller business. And we're in the midst of making a lot of progress with respect to our strategy to build out our core fusion offering. So much of our progress is going to be measured by the launch of those products, the complete -- the full offering, and we're well on our way. I would tell you that between now and the end of next year, most of those fundamental systems are planned to be launched and that bag should become quite full. And so every quarter that goes by, it becomes more of a sales execution matter for us than anything else. I don't think that we saw substantial changes within the marketplace. I don't think that we saw substantial changes in procedure rates for those market dynamics or pricing. So I think it's more of a Zimmer Spine-specific set of opportunities that are dictating our performance within that market. But when you're looking for broader characterizations of the market, it just is more difficult for us to do that in that product category, due to our relative size as compared to large joints, for instance.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Great. And just as a follow-up, can you talk about the distribution agreement you signed for the Lateral Locking Cage, and what do you see is the opportunity there?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes. That's a category that obviously has been one of the fastest growing over the last handful of years, and we haven't competed in that space. And it's really a good example of what we're doing by virtue of the combination of internal and external development to build out that portfolio. So it's an exclusive agreement that we've entered into. So this is a Zimmer-branded product that we're going to be distributing on a global basis. We like this system. There's some differentiated features to the locking plate. And we think that we have some opportunity even for further claim expansion within that product category. But it fits really well with our MIS focus. We have a very nice base of MIS technologies and intellectual property within that space. And this, the LCC, is going to fit right into that area of focus and build out a category that as I said, we had not completed in really whatsoever historically.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Adeyemi Ogunkoya - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Adeyemi, for Bruce. Actually, 2 questions for us. The first is now that we're a little bit closer to implementation, I was wondering if you could kind of share with us any update on your thoughts about how the Affordable Care Act might impact the U.S. knee market next year.", "James T. Crines", "Yes. I don't see that the Affordable Care Act is going to have necessarily a significant impact next year. When you look at the timing for those exchanges to get up and running and folks to gain access to coverage and care that otherwise may not have had that access or at least as directly, that's going to push into the year. And then obviously to the extent that they're seeking some type of assistance and care through the physician network and then ultimately referrals to specialists, just the staging of that is such that it's unlikely to have a significant impact, in our view, in 2014. I think that the broader question is, is it going to have a significant impact even in the intermediate to longer term? And that's subject to arguments as well relative to the average age for these patients. But one can build out a model that draws the conclusion on both sides of that position as to whether or not it's going to be a procedural accelerator. What we do know about the impact of the Affordable Care Act is we're going to, unless it's repealed, pay a significant amount of money in the form of the device tax. And in our case because of the accounting for that, it will impact more significantly in 2014 than '13.", "Adeyemi Ogunkoya - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then as I guess knee performance was strong across the board. But looking at hips, it looks like you were a little bit below the market, U.S. and x U.S. I was wondering if you could kind of comment on where you stand in terms of your U.S. sales force and distribution partnerships, the efforts you made to enhance performance there? And then x U.S., if there's anything you're seeing that may have caused below-market growth?", "David C. Dvorak", "I think that the market -- the performances within the Americas and Asia Pacific region were within a range of market. The slowdown for us in the overall number really comes primarily out of the European market. Again, we have a significant share and position within some of those developed markets that are at slow growth rates or contracting at this point in time due to some of the austerity measures and even the price down pressures within those markets. I do think that those developed markets over time will stabilize primarily because there continues to be patient demand. And I think that, that demand is going to have to get satisfied. So the longer-term view of those markets is one of seeing it stabilize and that's going to help our business. But in the meantime, we need to sharpen our skills and our execution within those markets. So I don't think that there are significant product gaps. I think that we can drive a better performance in all 3 geographic segments, but probably have the most room for improvement within our EMEA business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.", "Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "This is Brandon, on for Glenn. First, can you give us some updated thoughts on the value to Zimmer what the dental and spine business is? Or are these businesses that Zimmer needs get bigger in to be competitive? And just in general, how strategic are they for Zimmer?", "David C. Dvorak", "Those are businesses that, along with a couple of the others that we've put underneath the umbrella of global businesses, are obviously a bit more challenging because of the scale and size of those businesses. One has to resource those businesses to ensure that there is the full complement of leadership team in place, that there is a reinvestment in research and development and medical training and education et cetera and ensuring that there really is a fully developed global distribution footprint. So these are all businesses that we think technologies can be leveraged across from whether it's boney in-growth technologies with Trabecular Metal biologics capabilities. And so they're very central to our musculoskeletal theme in that regard. But at any given point in time, we're going to allocate our resources in accordance with highest opportunity and the best opportunity we have to create value. And so the relative positioning within our overall portfolio is going to be determined by a methodical strategic planning process to ensure that any of those business units is adequately resourced, but not at the same time crowding out our opportunities to create value even in the core franchise of large joints. And that's a balance that we look to strike and rebalance every year as we go through and refresh our strategic plan and then translate those determinations into an operating plan.", "Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then separately, can you kind of talk about how you're thinking about Stryker's purchase of Mako? And what Zimmer -- what can Zimmer do to minimize the competitive impact from this acquisition as Zimmer is the market share leader in knees?", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure. As I spoke to that topic earlier in this call, I again believe that, that kind of a transaction, if anything, validates the major premise that we've been operating under. And that is the right technologies, both preoperatively and interoperatively, can advance the cause towards providing more personalized solutions and putting those solutions and broader portfolio choices in the hands of surgeons. We've been at this for a half-dozen-plus years in earnest through internal and external development, and believe that our technologies that have been assembled, preoperative planning systems; our ISS; our eLIBRA; the PSI, Patient Specific Instrument offerings are very consistent with addressing that clinical need to enhance the feedback data and capability for the surgeons to be very precise in the selection and implantation and alignment and soft tissue balancing. And as we converge these technologies, we think that not only will it lead to a better clinical outcome, it will lead to a more satisfied patient and be very much an enabler to continue down this path of expanding the options for surgeons, so that the implant systems themselves can be broadened in a cost-effective way and still improve into the future the patient outcomes and satisfaction rates. So we like the bets that we placed and the progress that we're making, and believe that we're very well positioned within that space.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Mike Matson with Needham & Company.", "Michael Matson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Sort of fitting me in, I guess just wondering how I should think about the surgical business growth, when you do start to lap the high growth that you've had this year and potentially your competitor comes back on the market in the waste management area. I mean, do you think you can still -- I know you're not giving guidance for next year. But do you think that can still grow in that circumstance?", "David C. Dvorak", "Absolutely. This isn't a 1-year commitment on our part. There's going to be continuity of commitment. And that particular product line is one of several, both again, through internal and external development efforts as we build out our portfolio. And we've done so in past years. We're going to have broader opportunities in coming periods in a category like our -- like the power tools. And we look to both continue to advance in product categories where we already have a presence and add to those. So we're quite confident that we're going to be able to continue to build on that business and see that as being a terrific platform for both growth and value creation in coming periods.", "Michael Matson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then in your spine business with this lateral cage deal, I guess I was wondering where you're at in terms of some of the other instruments and so forth, like retractor and other products to go along with that, to really provide everything that's needed to do a lateral fusion?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, part of our plan -- and that's a good question. It -- we're in a good position, I would tell you, both as it relates to the retractor systems necessary for lateral access as well as the neural monitoring which is, as you know, an important enabler and aspect of that technology. So it's part of a comprehensive strategy within that space, and we'll have all the elements necessary to enter that market and be successful.", "Michael Matson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "All right. And then finally, just it looks like you had some very strong knee growth obviously, but your hip growth looks like it may have been kind of below the market. And so I guess obviously, it's good that Persona is doing so well. But it looks like to me, this could be the classic case of what we've seen with a lot of these orthopedics companies is where you watch a product in one category and it does really well, the sales reps kind of gravitate toward that and another area languishes a little bit. So -- I mean, is that what's happening here, and how are you going to sort of address that issue?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes. We think that we have a terrific portfolio on the hip side. And there is some natural dynamic along the lines that you described that -- we'll send your message out to the sales force to make sure that they're allocating their time in appropriate way. I will tell you that we're very cognizant of that behavioral dynamic, and we'll build plans and have incentive systems to ensure that we're winning in all categories. Because our overarching goal and expectation of ourselves is that we're going to outperform the market in every product category and every geographic segment. So that forms the basis for our discussions and refinement of our plans and no major gaps in our portfolio that wouldn't allow us to improve our performance in the hip category, concurrent with continuing to accelerate in the knee category.", "So with that, I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today and for your continued interest and support for Zimmer. We look forward to speaking to you on our fourth quarter conference call, which is scheduled for 8 a.m. on January 30, 2014. I'll turn the call back to you, Toni.", "Operator", "Okay.

I would like to turn the call over to Bob Marshall, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Marshall, you may begin your call.", "Robert J. Marshall", "Thanks, Toni. Good morning, and welcome to Zimmer's Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. I'm here with the CEO, David Dvorak; and our CFO, Jim Crines. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.", "Also, the discussions during this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations with these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included within the earnings release, which is available on our website at investor.zimmer.com.", "With that, I'll now turn the call over to David.", "David C. Dvorak", "Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call for the fourth quarter of 2013. This morning, I'll review our fourth quarter and full year 2013 financial results, including highlights from our performance. Jim will then provide additional financial details, as well as our 2014 guidance. I'll state all sales in constant currency terms and all earnings results on an adjusted basis.", "Zimmer drove accelerating growth throughout 2013 fueled by the successful commercialization of innovative new solutions across our portfolio from our flagship knee offering, Persona, The Personalized Knee System, to our differentiated Transposal fluid waste management system, which enhances our presence in the OR suite. Zimmer also delivered operating margin expansion through our operational excellence initiatives.", "As part of that effort, the company continued to make progress toward the achievement of excellence on our global quality infrastructure. These process-driven improvements will promote design for manufacturability and become the platform for the leaner, more efficient and effective manufacturing and distribution of our devices. In 2013, we continued to follow a disciplined approach to capital deployment. As part of our external development strategy, we enhanced our industry-leading portfolio with targeted complementary additions. These have increased the competitiveness of our existing business and has supported our entry into adjacent musculoskeletal markets.", "In line with our commitment to returning value to our stockholders, the company paid out more than $850 million in 2013 in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases. Our performance throughout the year was a validation of Zimmer's philosophy of growth through innovation and further bolstered our position as a global leader in health care, exclusively focused and fully diversified within musculoskeletal care. As we look to 2014 and beyond, we're confident that the company is well positioned for continued growth in the evolving global health care landscape through the ongoing development and commercialization of clinically relevant and innovative solutions.", "Consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter were $1.24 billion, an increase of 6.6%; and our earnings per share were $1.66, an increase of 9.9% over the prior year period. Full year sales for 2013 were $4.62 billion, an increase of 4.9% over 2012; and our earnings per share were $5.75, an increase of 8.5%.", "Turning to global market conditions. In the fourth quarter, musculoskeletal markets were healthy in the Americas and Asia Pacific, while stabilizing in Europe, Middle East and Africa. Increased procedural demand, particularly in the United States, contributed to a strong performance in the quarter. With respect to pricing, we experienced price pressure of negative 2.1% in the quarter, consistent with our expectations coming into the year.", "I'd now like to comment on our sales performance in each of our geographic segments. In the fourth quarter, America sales grew by 7.8% year-over-year, while Europe, Middle East and Africa increased sales by 2% and the Asia Pacific region grew 9.8%. Zimmer continued to benefit from focused sales execution, as well as the expanded rollout of surgical instrument sets in support of new product launches and our entry into new market categories.", "Turning now to the sales results of our product categories. Our market-leading knee business increased sales in the fourth quarter by 9.7%, reflecting positive volume and mix of 12.1% and negative price of 2.4%. Our America segment grew sales by an exceptional 10.7%, while Europe, Middle East and Africa increased sales by 7.2% and the Asia Pacific region delivered 10% growth compared with the previous year.", "Throughout 2013, our performance in knees was bolstered by the ongoing commercial release of Persona, The Personalized Knee System, designed to offer patients an unprecedented level of fit, feel and function. This next-generation total knee replacement has redefined the gold standard of care by marrying the unmatched fidelity of Zimmer's anatomical implant components with our suite of intelligent surgical instruments, including the iASSIST surgical guidance system, Patient Specific Instruments and the eLIBRA soft tissue balancing system. Persona also leverages Zimmer's proprietary advances in orthopedic technologies, including Trabecular Metal technology and VIVACIT-E, our advanced Vitamin E infused-bearing material.", "In addition to impressive sales growth in 2013, the resoundingly positive clinical feedback from our customers continues to validate our bullish position for this truly differentiated knee replacement system. As in previous quarters, the accelerated growth of our knee business was further strengthened by our expanding portfolio of early intervention and joint preservation treatments, including Subchondroplasty and Gel-One. These innovations serve the unmet needs of millions of patients and fit within our vision for offering the most personalized and appropriate therapies for every disease state and condition along the continuum of musculoskeletal care.", "Turning to our hip business. In the fourth quarter, we achieved sales growth of 2.9%, reflecting positive volume and mix of 5.3% and negative price of 2.4%. Sales increased by 4.5% in the Americas, decreased by 1% in Europe, Middle East and Africa and increased by 6% in the Asia Pacific region. As in the third quarter, a product mix favoring premium technologies support a solid performance in the Americas, including our proprietary Trabecular Metal technology and the VIVACIT-E, advanced-bearing surface material. We'll continue strengthening our global position in hips by bringing to market the most clinically relevant portfolio of patient match solutions to address the full spectrum of surgical philosophies. By way of example, the Continuum Acetabular Cup has become well respected within the surgeon community for addressing an unprecedented range of anatomy and bone quality.", "We've also seen steady growth of the Avenir hip system, which positions the company to compete in the minimally invasive anterior supine surgeries, one of the fastest-growing subsegments of the hip market. Additionally, a number of products from our broader portfolio continued to enjoy steady growth, such as the M/L Taper and Fitmore Hip Stems. Zimmer's strong clinical legacy and the industry-leading science backing these differentiated technologies support our confidence in the future growth of our hip business.", "Our Extremities business closed out 2013 with a solid 11% increase in sales, with results yet again driven by the sustained performance of our upper extremities portfolio. The Trabecular Metal Reverse Shoulder continues to lead within its category with notable sales growth. We're enthusiastic about the promising future of the Patient Specific Instrument shoulder system to enhance this offering with our advanced 3D visualization and personalized surgical planning software.", "We also look forward to the broader release of the next-cell Total Elbow to further enhance our position in upper extremities. As we build upon our success in Extremities, the company will remain focused on expanding our reach into new anatomical sites. The Trabecular Metal Total Ankle Replacement has enjoyed steadily increasing uptake since its introduction and continues to receive excellent clinical feedback for its unique tissue-sparing surgical approach. Moreover, the acquisition of Germany-based NORMED in the second quarter of 2013 has added new product offerings, as well as design capabilities to strengthen our lower extremity and total ankle portfolio.", "Dental sales increased 1.9% for the fourth quarter, with Zimmer's differentiated portfolio of premium and value-based solutions delivering steady performances as certain dental markets continued to stabilize. On the premium end of our portfolio, we expect to see continued strong performances from our leading regenerative products and Trabecular Metal Dental Implants for which we're preparing the market new offerings in the anesthetic dental zone in 2014. We're also optimistic about the continued expansion of our custom milled Zfx CAD/CAM Digital Dentistry Solutions. Finally, as part of our expanding value proposition for an evolving global dental market, we look forward to the broader release of our P-I branded value-based offerings.", "Turning to our Trauma business. Sales decreased by 1.2% in the fourth quarter. Our results in the Americas and Europe, Middle East and Africa regions were largely offset by a promising 15.2% sales increase in Asia Pacific. We're also encouraged by continuing steady sales for the Zimmer Natural Nail family and the NCB Periprosthetic Plating System. Although our trauma business faced challenges in achieving sales growth comparable to previous quarters, we'll continue to focus our execution and expand our presence in key U.S. markets, as well as in level 1 and 2 trauma centers. Looking forward, our comprehensive trauma portfolio continues to expand with exciting new introductions for the hand and wrist market to increase our global competitiveness.", "Zimmer's Spine sales decreased by 1.9% in the quarter compared to the prior year. Our encouraging performance in certain overseas markets, as well as the ongoing progress from recent product launches, has increased our competitiveness as we prepare to recapture growth opportunities in 2014. Our reinvigorated focus on our core fusion portfolio also continues to garner positive traction, with innovative offerings such as the TM Ardis and TM-S Interbody Fusion devices driving steady sales.", "As part of our ongoing growth strategy in Spine, we'll continue to leverage differentiated technologies to expand and enhance our portfolio. In addition to the ongoing release of the APEX Spine System, which strengthens our ability to address degenerative deformity and complex spinal conditions, we also expect our introduction of the lateral interbody system to contribute a growing share of revenues in 2014. This differentiated offering delivers a unique support mechanism above and below the spinal interbody and marks our entry into one of the fastest-growing subsegments of the spinal market.", "Zimmer's surgical and other category delivered another outstanding quarter, increasing sales by 15.9%, with the Americas growing by 22.8% over the prior year period. Results from our Europe, Middle East and Africa reflected a steady performance. And for another quarter, our legacy portfolio delivered solid growth in the Asia Pacific region. Our results in the surgical and other category continue to be led by impressive sales of our Transposal fluid waste management system. While we'll face challenging year-over-year sales comparisons throughout 2014, we're confident that this differentiated, complete solution for the OR suite has a promising future. We also saw a strong performance from our legacy portfolio, including sales of our bone cement products. As we look at 2014, we expect continued contributions from across our broadened surgical portfolio.", "Now I'd like to turn it over to Jim, who will provide additional financial details as well as our 2014 guidance.", "James T. Crines", "Thank you, David. I will review our fourth quarter performance in more detail, and then provide additional information related to our 2014 sales and earnings guidance. Our total revenues for the fourth quarter were $1,241,000,000, a 6.6% constant currency increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. Net currency impact for the quarter decreased revenues by 1.5% or $17 million. The negative currency impact for the quarter related principally to our Japanese yen and Australian dollar denominated revenues, partially offset by positive currency translation associated with our Euro-based revenues.", "Our adjusted gross profit margin was 73.6% for the quarter. The margin ratio declined 130 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. In the fourth quarter, we recognized approximately 50 basis points of charges related to the medical device tax. Together with higher surgical product sales, inventory obsolescence, manufacturing-related charges of negative price, these factors outweighed foreign currency hedge gains and cost savings from our operational excellence initiatives.", "The company's R&D expense decreased 16.1% or $9 million on a reported basis to 3.7% of net sales when compared to the prior year. The decrease in R&D expense continues to reflect the natural decline related to the completion of a number of large projects, the dedication of resources to our quality and operational excellence initiatives, as well as the effect of natural leverage associated with a higher top line typically experienced in the fourth quarter.", "Zimmer's pipeline of new and innovative products, nonetheless, remains robust, which will help drive growth in future periods. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $477 million in the fourth quarter and at 38.4% of sales or 60 basis points below the prior year. In the quarter and for the full year, a portion of the savings generated from our operational excellence initiatives were invested in higher selling, marketing and distribution costs associated with the commercialization of a number of new products, as well as direct sales integration in certain key markets. While continuing to invest in growth initiatives, the company was able to lower SG&A as a percentage of sales for the full year by 70 basis points.", "In the quarter, the company reported pretax charges of $61.2 million in special items and $12.8 million cost of products sold pertaining to global restructuring, quality and operational excellence initiatives, certain litigation and recent acquisitions. Adjusted fourth quarter 2013 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these charges, which include $40 million related to quality and operational excellence initiatives and manufacturing, logistics and sales, $14.5 million connected with certain outstanding litigation matters and $19.5 million in integration and other costs. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to $389.3 million. At 31.4%, our adjusted operating profit rate to sales ratio was 20 basis points higher than the prior year fourth quarter.", "Net interest expense for the quarter amounted to $12.3 million, which was favorable when compared to the prior year quarter. Adjusted net earnings were $288.6 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 9.5% compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9.9% to $1.66 on a 173.5 million average outstanding diluted shares. These adjusted earnings per share are inclusive of approximately $0.05 of share-based compensation. At $1.36, reported diluted earnings per share increased 54.5% from the prior year fourth quarter reported EPS of $0.88.", "Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.6% and was 210 basis points favorable when compared to prior year due to more favorable mix of earnings from lower tax jurisdictions. Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.3% as the majority of restructuring and other special items charges are incurred in higher tax jurisdictions.", "During the quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares at a total purchase price of $241 million. The authorization under which these shares were purchased expired on December 31, 2013. As was previously disclosed, a new $1 billion authorization was approved last month. The company had approximately 169.8 million shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2013, down from 171.7 million as of December 31, 2012.", "Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $300.2 million, a decrease of 18.4% from $368 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. The decrease is driven primarily by increased cash outflows associated with certain claims, restructuring actions and quality and operational excellence initiatives.", "Net inventories were $1,075,000,000 at the end of the fourth quarter, a decrease of $7 million from September 30, 2013. Adjusted inventory days on hand finished the quarter at 277 days, a decrease of 7 days as compared to the prior quarter.", "As of the end of the fourth quarter, net receivables increased to $937 million from $885 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 or 6% over the prior year. Our adjusted trade accounts receivable days sales outstanding finished the quarter at 65 days, an increase of 1 day when compared with the prior year. Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter amounted to $90.1 million. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was $251 million, $30 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2012. We define free cash flow as operating cash flow less cash outlays for instruments and property, plant and equipment.", "During the full year, the primary drivers for the decrease of free cash flow included the ongoing investments in our new product inventory, capacity-related investments and the acquisition and deployment of instruments to support the full release of Persona and other new products. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $49.6 million, including $26.8 million for instruments and $22.8 million for property, plant and equipment.", "I'd like to turn now to our guidance for 2014. In our earnings release this morning, we announced that the company expects full year 2014 revenues to increase between 3% and 5% in constant currency when compared to 2013. At this time, assuming currency rates remain at year end 2013 levels, we anticipate foreign currency translation will decrease our reported 2014 revenues by an estimated 0.5%. Therefore, on a reported basis, our revenues are projected to be between 2.5% and 4.5% above 2013 results.", "Among our market assumptions for 2014, we believe that full year knee and hip markets will grow in the low- to mid-single digits. We expect global market conditions will remain relatively stable in 2014 when compared to the full year 2013.", "With regard to pricing for 2014, we assume stable but declining price. Beginning in the second quarter, we expect bi-annual Japanese price adjustments to take effect, along with some anticipated but moderately weaker pricing in Europe. In the aggregate, this leads us to expect pricing for 2014 to be between minus 2% and minus 3% compared with 2013.", "Moving down the income statement. Assuming currency rates remain at recent levels, we expect our gross margin ratio to be between 73% and 74% for the full year. This takes into account anticipated gains on foreign currency hedges, principally from the Japanese yen, as well as the full impact of the medical device excise tax. Beginning with the first quarter, we anticipate the tax alone will result in approximately $10 million of charges in cost of sales on a quarterly basis. We expect R&D expense for the year to average approximately 4% to 4.5% of sales. Although we have cycled that to several major product development projects, our pipeline remains robust. Changes we have made to increase the productivity and process efficiency of our R&D function enable us to more effectively focus investments in this area, while still supporting the vitality of our pipeline.", "SG&A is expected to be between 38.5% and 39% of sales for the year as we realize efficiencies from our global operational excellence initiatives and further leverage revenue growth. Among -- assuming variable rates remain at recent levels, we expect interest and other expense of around $50 million in 2014 due mainly to interest rate swaps entered into during the second half of 2013. We anticipate a 2014 full year adjusted effective tax rate of 25.5%, which is slightly above our final full year rate for 2013. We anticipate diluted weighted average shares outstanding for 2014 to be at or near 169 million shares. Therefore, 2014 full year adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be in a range of $6.10 to $6.30.", "With regard to the first quarter of 2014, constant currency revenue growth is anticipated to be in a range of 3% to 5%, while foreign currency translation is expected to reduce our reported revenue growth by an estimated 1%. Therefore, on a reported basis, our first quarter 2014 revenues are projected to grow between 2% and 4%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter 2014 are expected to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.48.", "As indicated in our release, we expect to record pretax charges of approximately $250 million within the 2014 operating period pertaining to global restructuring, quality and operational excellence initiatives and recent acquisitions. Therefore, to arrive at our anticipated reported GAAP earnings per share, you should subtract these charges or approximately $1.10 per share on an after-tax basis. The programs to be completed in 2014 are expected to generate annualized pretax savings of $60 million. Together with savings realized across the various initiatives completed prior to 2014, total run rate savings are projected to reach $290 million by the end of 2014. This reflects significant progress towards the realization of our previously announced target of $400 million in total savings by 2016.", "Turning to cash flow. We anticipate total capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $350 million to $360 million. Instrument capital is expected to be in the range of $200 million to $210 million, as part of our ongoing launch of the Persona knee system, as well as other new product introductions. Traditional PP&E is expected to be approximately $150 million, reflecting the cash outlays necessary to update and modernize our manufacturing capabilities and support new product developments and commercialization activities.", "Our guidance assumes that we will continue to return cash to our stockholders through our share repurchase and dividend programs. Free cash flow in excess of these capital allocation programs is soon to be held in cash and cash equivalents for other investments. Estimated depreciation and amortization expense for the year is in the range of $365 million to $375 million.", "Finally, please note that our guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or other unforeseen events.", "David, I'll turn the call back over to you.", "David C. Dvorak", "Thanks, Jim. In 2013, Zimmer's focused execution around an expanded portfolio accelerated revenue growth in both our core reconstructive franchises and global businesses. With revolutionary new offerings such as Persona, The Personalized Knee System, we continued to set the pace for the musculoskeletal market with clinically relevant solutions designed to serve the needs of surgeons, their patients and health care institutions. As we advance this strategic vision in 2014 and beyond, we'll remain committed to our core business principles of delivering growth through innovation, cultivating quality and operational excellence and serving as disciplined stewards of capital. We're confident that these critical elements of our value creation framework will continue laying the foundation of our future growth.", "And now I'd like to ask Toni to begin the Q&A portion of our call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just looking at -- Dave, as you think about 2014 on the back of what looks like a very much improved major joint market, how are you thinking about volume growth in the major territories for major joints U.S., developed x U.S. and emerging markets?", "David C. Dvorak", "We did see the sequential improvement in procedural demand as 2013 progressed, but I think that we want to be a bit cautious about taking the exit growth rate on procedural demand from Q4 as an extrapolation as to what we're going to see throughout 2014. And so I think you want to think about the demand producing growth numbers that are consistent with all of 2013 as opposed to jumping off of Q4 and carrying that growth trajectory into 2014. Beyond the U.S., and those comments are probably more focused on the U.S., Bruce, I think that we would expect to see some stabilization in the developed markets within Europe. We did see that as 2013 progressed and in particular, in Q4. Now it's different by country within Europe, Middle East and Africa, and it's also different by product category in some jurisdictions within Europe, Middle East and Africa. But as a general trend, we would expect to see stabilization and that was measured against 2013, a bit of improvement in 2014.", "Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And so like -- just to kind of -- if we think of the U.S. with units around 4 to 5 and developed x U.S., 2 to 3, and emerging markets solid double digits, is that appropriate to think about kind of the growth rates in volume?", "David C. Dvorak", "I think that this is directionally correct. I think that the growth rate, obviously, much higher in the emerging markets. I think that the growth rate that you just articulated is going to likely continue to be higher in developed markets in Asia Pacific than developed markets in Europe, Middle East and Africa as well.", "Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Perfect. And just in terms of just qualitatively about -- I know the medtech tax is a big headwind next -- first half of next year. Should we, in aggregate, be expecting like around 50 bps of operating margin? Directionally, how should we be thinking about the progression for the company?", "James T. Crines", "I think that's very fair, Bruce, as we -- as I indicated in my scripted remarks, we're anticipating the tax to result in about $10 million of charges running through cost of goods on a quarterly basis in 2014. We -- if you look at how that compares with 2013, we recognize the modest amount of tax in the fourth quarter, so the headwind will persist, if you will, at least for the first 3 quarters before we get into the fourth quarter of 2014 where we have year-over-year comp work in both years.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So obviously, overall, you guys are growing as fast or faster than most medical device companies at this point. But I wanted to ask you a question specifically about hips because that's an area where you're not quite growing as fast as your peers. And in Europe, despite very easy comps, you had another negative growth performance in the quarter. And so I'm wondering if you can just talk a little bit more about the hip business and the prospects for the hip business and the potential for accelerating growth in 2014.", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure. In -- the points that you make are appropriate. I would tell you that we believe that we have a very, very competitive portfolio at this point on the hip side. Some of what you're seeing in the Europe, Middle East and Africa performance is a matter of our market share position in those developed markets that have slowed down. We have large share in some of those developed markets in Central Europe, for example, and so we're going to be affected disproportionately by those slowdowns. So that's part of it. I think that there's also a lot of energy and excitement globally about the launch of Persona, and so we'll balance that focus a bit better in 2014. But with that, by the way of background, Bob, I would tell you we're very confident that you'll see improved performance within the hip product category in 2014 for the company.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then as a follow-up, I was wondering if I could just ask you about sort of a big picture question, David, as you look at 2014. For the prospects for your balance sheet in terms of use of cash, buyback versus M&A, is it a robust environment from your perspective in terms of M&A opportunities? Or is this likely to be another year where even you're more active with the buyback?", "David C. Dvorak", "Well, I think that you should plan on the buyback program operating now that's consistent with past periods, but we're going to be active as we have in the past on the M&A front. We'll be disciplined about the returns that we would expect through any of those deals. But I think that, if anything, the momentum that we've created with the new product introductions and the top line...", "[Technical difficulty]", "David C. Dvorak", "I'll just pick up and reiterate, Bob, in response to your last question. I was starting to say that you should expect the capital deployment and the disciplines around that to be consistent with past years. We'll be very proactive about examining opportunities on the acquisition front as we have in the past, but we're going to be disciplined about that, and the return metrics will be consistently applied with what we've done in past operating periods. I think, if anything, in response to your question, as far as additional color, I would say that the new product launches and the success and momentum that those are creating within the business, I feel, put us in a great place to examine deals of all sizes in 2014.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Taylor with Barclays Capital.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I guess, my first question was, I wanted to just understand how you're thinking about some of the momentum that you saw in the knee business, I guess, as you look at both the Persona launch and any contributions from Gel-One. How should we think about the additional growth that you could see year-over-year based on the pace of your launch of those products? And then, also, do you have a strong view or any kind of view on how much of the fourth quarter growth could have been due to some seasonality in the U.S.?", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure. I -- the majority of the performance improvement, and obviously, within the knee category in the United States jurisdiction in particular, the performance improvement for the company was substantial over the course of 2013. And we reestablished momentum within that product category. It's a very, very important product category to us for obvious reasons. And what we accomplished in that year was meaningful and will carry momentum into 2014 and beyond. We're extraordinarily excited about the pipeline that we have beyond the initial launch of Persona, both within primary knees and other subsegments. So I expect that momentum to continue, and the success that we believe we're having with competitive surgeons already with the Persona system is part of the basis for that optimism as to what we're going to do in go-forward periods.", "I would tell you that the contributions within the knee category in the Americas, by way of example, when you mentioned Gel-One, it's -- it isn't material relative to the performance improvement that you saw sequentially from Q1 through Q4 in 2013. So you can read that as the vast majority of our success in 2013 within the knee category is very much driven by the launch of the Persona system. I think that, in response to the second part of your question, Matt, that -- as to what we saw by way of demand -- procedural demand in the fourth quarter in the United States, it was clearly a substantial uptick.", "I don't think that one should carry that into their expectations as to what we're going to see throughout 2014. I don't know that one wants to describe that as seasonality either in the sense of it's going to repeat in every fourth quarter hereafter. I think that at least an element of this, and all this is anecdotal as others have discussed that reported out prior to today, but clearly, there's an element of that procedural uptick that is driven by the implementation of health care reform and some of the perceived potential disruption to plans or access to particular surgeons. But that led to -- but I don't think it's very easy for anyone to tease that apart with precision at this point in time. I do believe that part of what one should take away from the uptick and procedural demand is, after the fundamental demographic drivers, there is an aging population out there. These are procedures that have terrific clinical results.", "And relative to the knee, for joint replacement, the procedure is still underutilized and economically very beneficial to society, is measured out, including the most recent publication in the JBJS from August regarding financial results and economic benefits to society of the 600,000-plus knee replacements that were done in the United States in 2009. So that underlying demand is real. And with a little bit of an adjustment to the environment in which people are making those decisions, you can see how the procedural demand can increase in a short period of time. So I think it's just more indicative of from a long-term perspective, this is going to be a very healthy market and a consistently performing market.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just a follow-up quickly on the surgical product segment. So I wanted to understand a little bit better your expectations for the broadening out of some of your instruments as that is opposed to some tough comps with the fluid waste management system this year. How should we expect growth to evolve in OSP and Other this year?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, we're going to be in a good position to continue to grow that business. Obviously, there are some pretty extraordinary comps on a year-over-year basis. Part of what will -- but we'll be in a growth mode to be sure within the Surgical and Other category. Part of what will happen, as we described in the prior call, was that we'll be transitioning a bit from the majority of those incremental sales being capital units being placed to more of the higher-margin consumable aspect of that. And that will help us on the margin front as the quarters progress. But continue to expand that portfolio, more to come in the way of new offerings, enhancements to our competitiveness on the power tool side as the year progresses by a way of example. So we're really bullish on that category and that business performing very, very well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JP Morgan.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Could we just spend a couple of minutes on the P&L? So first item, just can you talk about the strategy around the R&D spend? I don't think we went into the year expecting R&D to be down 9% to 10%. So can you talk a little bit about what's going on there and the reallocation of your spending? And then second, I just want to make sure we've got the gross margin mix right. How much was the FX positive to gross margin this quarter?", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure, Mike. As we described with respect to the R&D spending, there was substantial effort and focus on some of the large product systems that were under development. And so we're expecting that to balance out over time. I would tell you that you ought not to read too much into the Q4 absolute dollar spend. We still are investing, we have a very robust pipeline. I think that you'll see us balancing that out over time. And if anything, in the 2014 time period, an expansion of our investment in research and development. But it's going to be in accordance with our view as to what opportunities that we have in particular points in time. So you'll see it fluctuate back up and you ought not to read anything more significant into it.", "James T. Crines", "And Mike, this is Jim. On the question about hedge gains in the fourth quarter, they contributed about 20 basis points in a favorable way, obviously, through the margin ratio in the fourth quarter. Was there another question on gross margin?", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes, Jim. So as you guide going forward, you're still seeing some favorable FX because of your yen hedges?", "James T. Crines", "Yes. Yes, we are definitely. And the guidance, the 73% to 74% guidance we've given for the full year reflects that, as well as expectations for a more favorable mix of revenues. David touched on that in part with respect to the surgical business, but it's also the case as our -- we restored growth, as David talked about, in the knee franchise that, that will contribute in a positive way. As we see more robust growth in the U.S. market relative to the international markets, that contributes in a positive way. We have incremental manufacturing cost savings out of our operational excellence initiatives that will contribute in 2014. And we're also anticipating lower inventory obsolescence charges relative to the last few years. The last few years we experienced some pretty significant charges largely kind of driven by the launch of these new products and cannibalization of the products that they're displacing. So all of those things are taken into account and help to fully offset the headwinds from both the medical device excise tax as well as negative price.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "That's helpful. And maybe Jim, just spend a minute on all these charges, because there's a lot in this quarter. And obviously, with your guidance for GAAP versus adjusted EPS for '14, you're assuming a number of incremental charges and you put them under these banners such as operational excellence and none of us have any idea what that means. So spend a minute on what are you writing off and what is being backed out as you get to adjusted earnings?", "James T. Crines", "Sure. So it's -- I'd have to go back to the announcement that we made a couple of years back indicating that we were kicking off of a program to, among other things, help us drive about $400 million of operating costs savings over the course of a number of operating periods, which will get us to this $400 million of total savings by 2016. There are a number of different initiatives. We've talked from time to time about the various initiatives that are -- will get us to the point where we've achieved the $400 million in savings.", "As I indicated in my prepared remarks, we're making really good progress on those initiatives. They include quality and manufacturing excellence initiatives, and there's a significant amount of activity and effort. Fees that are incurred both for the consulting partners that we have engaged to help us with those efforts, as well as for the dedicated personnel. And we set it up that way so that we have -- we will have the business units to, say appoint dedicated personnel to the various projects. They have the opportunity to backfill those positions within their businesses and carry on with their sort of strategic and tactical day-to-day activities.", "And we've got the distribution and logistics initiative. I think we talked about this a little bit. Among other things, it resulted in the closure of a facility here in Warsaw that was our finished goods warehouse, which has been relocated to -- closer to Memphis, Tennessee and is driving operational expense savings in freight and distribution. We have a sourcing initiative which, I will tell you at this point, is contributing a fair share of the over $200 million of savings that we've achieved coming out of 2013 on a run-rate basis. So that's probably just touching on a handful, it doesn't cover all of the initiatives -- of the initiatives, and hopefully, gives you some idea of what we have going on and the costs associated, what those costs are for.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "I wanted to start with a follow-up on your comments around sort of this kind of Q4 seasonality that you're seeing. It sounds like you're relatively confident that at least a piece of the market uptick is kind of this pull forward from the implementation of the health care reform. I'm wondering if you're basing those comments on kind of what you're seeing into January. And then, if the kind of deceleration in your Q1 guidance versus the 6.6% constant currency sell-through growth that you saw in Q4, is that all due to kind of that comment around -- and your assumption of lower market growth in hips and knees, or is there something else to that guidance?", "David C. Dvorak", "No, it really is just a perspective rather than a forward read of what's happening in the first month of 2014. It isn't based upon that, it's based upon the view that these -- one quarter performance within the market and the procedural demand ought not to be overemphasized and developing a mindset that, that's a trend going into 2014. So we just believe that the trailing 4 quarters are more representative of what one should expect to see in 2014, and we're applying that to our annual guidance and the forward view and visibility as it relates to some color around what to expect in the first quarter as well. It's really that simple, Derrick.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And that first quarter guidance, is that deceleration then all based on kind of what you just talked about, or is there something maybe beyond the market for hips and knees that's going into that Q1 guidance?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, it's more fundamentally premised on what I just described.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay, great. As a follow-up, I wanted to talk a little about, or focus on your European knee performance this quarter, which had a significant acceleration. Can you just talk a little bit about sort of what drove that pickup this quarter, maybe talk about geographies and put that in context perhaps with the pressure that you've been seeing throughout the year on margins due to sort of unfavorable geographic mix in Europe? How does this acceleration that we're seeing in European knees impact that?", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure. We -- as you mentioned, we had a really nice quarter in European knees. And I think that the sales execution -- and most of that, frankly, is driven by NexGen, which is a system with terrific clinical results that has been out for some time and is a trusted system and going to continue to be a very important part of our portfolio. And the European team in those developed markets, in particular, did a terrific job on the sales execution front. We also benefited from -- sequentially as the year progressed, as I mentioned, some improvement and stabilization in some of the markets. And for us, where we have significant share in those developed markets, if there's a bit of improvement, that creates a nice tailwind as opposed to the headwind that we had been facing in the past. So I think it was a combination of excellent execution by the sales team and a bit of improvement in some of those large, developed markets that helped us produce a very good result within Europe, Middle East and Africa in the fourth quarter.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Great. And does that help your sort of margin mix and can you put that into context with that margin pressure that you've been seeing -- the negative margin pressure that you've been seeing from geographic mix over the last few quarters?", "James T. Crines", "Sure. It does, Derrick. As I indicated in response to an earlier question, the positive momentum that's been restored within that franchise globally is -- will have a -- is and will continue to have a positive impact on gross margin.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "I had one on sort of the macro -- your macro view that you talked a little bit about, David, and sort of the demographics for this, so can you maybe take a step back and -- I mean, where we are in this sort of slow recovery in this market? And then I had one on some of your restructuring initiatives, for Jim. So first on the market, I guess, I'd love to understand if you could sort of sketch out where you think we are in terms of working our way back through, I don't know if you look at it this way, patients who've deferred over the past few years, patients who are waving, patients maybe who -- I think you mentioned there are some -- some of the strength in Q4 came out of this sort of uncertainty in that access to doctors. So do you feel like we're sort of back to a state of equilibrium? Do you feel like there are still a lot of patients out there, sort of the demographics and sustainability in the U.S. market? And it'd be great to get your perspective. And then, as I mentioned, one follow-up.", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure, Matt. I do think it's marching towards a more normalized state. I think that in that process, there are going to be some ups and downs by month and by quarter towards a more normalized state. We never believe that it would be circumstance where even with a better understood macroeconomic environment that there was going to be some bolus that was going to be sustained and pushed, the backlog of patients that had been deferring the election to move forward with these procedures, through all at once. I think that it's going to be a bit more episodic and just a general trend towards normalization. And that's really part of what is informing and what we're expressing this morning about.", "I think you want to look forward to 2014 and think about the global markets. And you can apply this to the U.S. market as well as generally feeling more like 2013 than necessarily like 2014 if it proves to be the case that there is a continued uptick at any point in 2014. And one can modify the view and you might even examine, at some point, a deeper penetration and acceptance of these solutions. But I think that it's going to march towards an equilibrium, a more normalized state. I don't think that it's going to be a bolus push through and then a drop back off, but there'll be some ups and downs along the way. And the underlying demand in each of these procedures will be the constant in all of that.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And then, Jim, you mentioned your sourcing initiative and distribution changes that you made, moving the center out of Warsaw. I think you and I talked a little bit about some additional work that you're doing to reduce your inventory burden and maybe take on some more of the distribution initiatives throughout the U.S. in a broader way. I don't know if you're prepared to talk about that. I'd love to understand what other opportunities there are for you to improve its inventory and distribution in the U.S? And then if I could, you went through a bunch of little bits of the gross margin, but I don't think you gave us the basis point impact to D/O [ph] in the quarter?", "James T. Crines", "Okay. I'll start with the -- where you landed at the end. D/O [ph] charges in the quarter represented a drag on the gross margin of somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 to 70 basis points. And that would have been a bit higher than what we would have seen in the prior year, maybe 10 or 20 basis points higher than what we would have seen in the prior year. And then as for the operational excellence initiative that is really focused on distribution, it's a global initiative, so it does not only apply to the U.S., it does extend outside the U.S. as well. We're going to continue to look at our own sort of processes from -- how we distribute out of our own finished goods, warehouse into the field. And then -- and that's -- most of the work we've completed today is really around the piece of the distribution chain that we have full ownership of.", "The continuing sort of aspects of that particular initiative do involve having us partner more closely with our independent agents in the U.S. and then, also, with our forward-stocking locations that we own outside the U.S. And looking for opportunities to rationalize our footprint, establish better sharing of the inventory across territories. And there's still a lot of work to do on that front, Matt. And we're continuing with that effort and will eventually have an opportunity to reduce the amount of capital that we have tied up in inventory as a consequence. So I think -- not going to see much of that, don't expect to see much of that benefit in 2014. Would expect to begin to see some of that benefit in 2015 and beyond.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "The first question has to do with the Asia Pacific region, in both hips and knees, that continues to be sort of a weak area for you. What does it take to turn that around?", "David C. Dvorak", "It's not the case, Joanne, that hips and knees were anything but a strength for us through, really, 2013 generally and certainly in the fourth quarter. So, are you adjusting for currency when you look at the numbers?", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I may not be looking at it on a fully ex-FX basis. So forgive me on that.", "David C. Dvorak", "That's okay. We provide that, the breakout, on a constant currency basis and we had good performances in both of those large joint categories.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "All right. Well, never mind that one then.", "David C. Dvorak", "All right then.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Next year, in Asia Pacific, how much are you dialing in for a change in reimbursement?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, I gather that when you talk about Asia Pacific, it's Japan's biannual price adjustment in particular that you're referencing?", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Correct.", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, we don't have clarity on that at this point. But I think one should plan to see biannual price reductions that are negative in their nature and in a range of something that's consistent with past adjustments. And that's what we have modeled in at this point in time. So that would be something that would have an effect within that particular country of -- a range of negative mid-single digits as it has an effect on 2014 because it will impact 3 quarters of the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.", "Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "One segment that came in a little bit lower than our expectations was trauma. I'm just wondering if the issues in trauma are a function of the Johnson & Johnson-Synthes merger finally kind of complete, clicking, and I'm wondering if they gained -- would gain momentum. So just maybe some of your high-level thoughts on trauma and how that recovers and starts to grow in 2014.", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure, Glenn. I think that as it relates to the U.S. performance in particular in the fourth quarter, and this is likely to be the case in the first quarter of 2014, too, that we benefited from the disruption that they experienced in the prior period with the recall. And so that has -- anniversarying that growth out and the recapture of that business, which everyone anticipated would be the likely case. They've been able to relaunch those products and so that's part of the GAAP in the performance that you see. I think beyond that, we look at our portfolio right now within the trauma business favorably. We think that we have a very competitive offering and we're doing a nice job of selling trauma in many o U.S. markets. We have work to do to develop the right level of focus to fully exploit the opportunities that we have within that portfolio within the United States. And so you should expect us to achieve better performance as 2014 progresses, but we'll start the year with a bit of a headwind because of that anniversarying of the opportunity that we were able to take advantage of last year.", "Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And then just for Jim, on the share buyback for 2014. How should we model that out that? Does that get spread evenly throughout 2014 or does it come more front-end loaded?", "James T. Crines", "Sure. So as Dave said, first of all, you should model out somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 million of spending on share repurchases over the course of 2014, consistent with what we've done in prior periods. I would tell you as well that we would intend to also buy back any dilution that we experience from option exercises as necessary, so that could potentially put us in excess of that $500 million. And then, I'm not going to comment, give guidance on the specific timing of when we would be in the market, Glenn, so I -- and probably the smartest thing to do would be just what you described.", "Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So just model evenly throughout the year? Okay.", "James T. Crines", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I just wanted to focus on the guidance for a minute. How are you guys thinking about the 2 less selling days that you had in Q1 of 2013? Are there 2 less selling days in Q1 2014? And your EPS guidance implies only 6% to 10% EPS growth and your goal has been 8% to 12%, with sales in the low- to mid-single digits. So my question is, why the conservatism on the 2014 EPS guidance?", "James T. Crines", "Sure. Let me first of all address the billing day question. We do pick up a billing day in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2014, but that's offset by some loss of billing days in certain markets outside the U.S. So in the aggregate, we're anticipating that we pick up about half the day in the first quarter and then get that back in the second quarter. So not as pronounced as what you might have thought in terms of 2 additional billing days. And that's certainly taking into account the guidance that we provided both for the first quarter and the full year. And then with respect to EPS, I would just -- keep in mind that 2014 -- I suppose unlike some other companies who took on the full effect of the medical device excise tax in 2013, we're taking that on in 2014 just reflecting on what we guided with respect to gross margin and the impact of the medical device excise tax. If you would have add that back to what -- the midpoint of what we're guiding to, you'd be adding back something in the order of $0.15 of earnings, and that would get you closer within that -- the midpoint of that range that you referenced. That's really the issue that we have, frankly, with respect to 2014. That's a headwind that's not, at least at this stage, fully reflected in our results.", "Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "That's very helpful. Just one follow-up. You guys have done a great job with these bolt-on acquisitions like Dornoch, which contributed to your growth in 2013. Is there anything in 2014 like that, that you would highlight, such as Subchondroplasty that could augment growth in 2014?", "David C. Dvorak", "It certainly is the case that, that was successful, not the only successful bolt-on acquisition but probably the one that was most pronounced in fiscal year 2013. Those are tough ones to find, tough ones to repeat. I would tell you that in the aggregate, we continue to be excited about the opportunities. And we always have a pipeline of those types of acquisitions that we're working on at any given point in time. So without getting out ahead of ourselves, I wouldn't foresee that there is a single product category that would allow us to repeat what we did in 2013. But I think in the aggregate, you'll see continued strong performance with those bolt-on acquisitions. And we don't end up picking up much by the way of revenue growth by doing those acquisitions. It truly is the case that, that's organic growth post closing of those deals because we're finding new anatomical sites or other market adjacencies within musculoskeletal health. And we find nice traction being able to push those through our existing distribution channel and leveraging existing relationships. So that's a recipe that you'll see continue. I doubt that there will be a repeat of the Dornoch acquisition in 2014. But in the aggregate, you'll see continued success with those.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Dave, I wanted to come back to R&D, but the less focused on the fourth quarter. If you actually look at the guidance for '14, it's going to be the third straight year you're guiding R&D down as a percentage of sales. I wonder, can you give us a greater sense of the type of privatization [ph] happening within the business? And does this trend reflect -- what does this trend reflect, frankly? Does it reflect some sense of product maturity? Does it suggest that you're more likely or need to do more incremental M&A? I'm just trying to put that multiyear trend in context.", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, I would start by just clarifying that the guidance that we articulated gives you -- you talk about it as a percentage of sales, but as an absolute dollar figure we would look to spend anywhere from $10 million to $20 million according to our guidance, above what we spend in 2013. So the absolute spend is going to expand and that's going to flex depending upon what we see by way of opportunity both internally and externally as well. So if there's an opportunity for us to accelerate the development of a particular internal project or getting new an adjacency that we think is consistent with our strategy and can create value, then that number is going to go up. So again, I don't think one should be at all alarmed if you look at -- and I don't believe that it's reflective at all of the opportunity to continue to innovate in a clinically relevant way. We're really excited about the opportunities that we have going forward. So we just are birthing the largest product development launch in the company's history and we want to make sure that we're putting our energies to getting the commercialization efforts on Persona just right and fully taking advantage of that launch. But you're going to see continued products rolling out, getting launched, and our pipeline is going to be very healthy.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Good, Dave. Very clear. And maybe just one follow-up either for you or for Jim. Your pricing pressure was a little incrementally heavy in the fourth quarter, but I wouldn't say materially so, at least in our view. But considering the very strong strength we saw in Persona and some of your public commentary about the ability to launch that product as a premium product, I think we would have expected a little better price mix in the fourth quarter given the strength of Persona. Is there something underlying that may be offsetting that Persona strength? Can you maybe comment on the ability to get premium pricing for Persona?", "David C. Dvorak", "I think you have to remember that when we talk about price, we're calculating now to the best of our ability, on a SKU basis, pure price as opposed to mix. And so the mix and volume we aggregate in discussing our results and then the pure price is what we try to break out for you with a lot of specificity by product category and geographic segment.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "So you're still confident, David, that we're getting mix benefit on Persona?", "David C. Dvorak", "Absolutely.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just as, I guess, a follow-up on the pricing side. It looks like the Americas pricing got a little bit worse this quarter, and I was just wondering if you could maybe just comment on that or whether it's just kind of -- I know it bounces around quarter-to-quarter. But your guidance is down 2% to 3% for the full year, it's also a little incrementally worse, and I understand Japan probably adds in there. But I think you also mentioned Europe. So maybe just walk us through kind of what you're seeing on the price side globally?", "James T. Crines", "Yes, Kristen, this is Jim. First of all, with respect to the Americas, that is the case, that it's incrementally -- that we saw a little more in pure price, as David talked about. So there's some incremental sort of discounting, if you will, of some of the legacy products within our portfolio within the Americas that is being offset by the premium that we're getting on new products that are getting introduced into the U.S. market. And again, that favorable mix benefit is not reflected in the pure price discussion -- disclosures that we're providing. With respect to Europe, in the past, when we were able to offset some of the price pressure we're seeing in some of the developed markets with the forward integration, transactions we had underway in various operating periods. We're far enough down the road with these forward integration transactions, that there's really less opportunity to offset some of that price pressure in some of the developed markets in Europe, but that's where we see some incremental pressure. And then, as you pointed out, we, as everyone knows need to take into account in our guidance for 2014 the fact that there will be a price cut, a reimbursement price cut in Japan that takes effect in April 1. And all of that is what's reflected in that minus 2% to minus 3%.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. So it sounds like all regions, I guess, in your view are likely to see incremental pricing pressure over the next year for all of the reasons you just mentioned?", "James T. Crines", "A modest amount of incremental pressure, that's right.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And would you say -- I know you mentioned the mix benefit and David mentioned it, too. If one were to look at, say, knees or hips, if you look at just the mix versus price, is it net positive or net negative? Though it seems like it would be more net negative given some of the pricing that you broke out earlier in your prepared marks.", "James T. Crines", "I wouldn't assume that. It's probably the case across the market that -- it's probably a net positive across the market. If you consider some cases, particularly with respect to hips, there are more revision procedures being done, which is something else you have to take into account. But it's also the case that the advanced bearing materials within the hip category are gaining traction. I think that's the case. Certainly the case with respect to our results, you see some indication. That's also the case with some of our competitors' results. And then the new knee systems that are getting introduced. At least we -- can't speak to the other companies, but at least in our case, as David said, we're getting a premium that is sticking and adding in a meaningful way to the growth, the volume mix growth that we are reporting, and were reporting in the back half of 2013.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And then, just a follow-up on the one-time charges. How much of those are going to be cash, and is there any way to just piece that? I know you walked through, with Mike's question, just all the different things. But any way to just kind of bucket that $250 million? Since it is a pretty large offer on a pretax basis, how much is the optimization versus anything else that is in there?", "James T. Crines", "I would tell you the majority of it is for the cost, and they are largely cash cost connected with the operational excellence initiatives there as well. And it's somewhere in the neighborhood of about $20 million out of the $250 million connected with integration of the recent bolt-on acquisitions that we've done. Those costs, although they do include a number of things, they can include employee termination benefits, contract termination fees, facility closing costs. They do also include dedicated personnel costs, as I indicated, and consulting fees. They can also include potential impairment charges, accelerated depreciation for assets that are being taken out of service or maybe pending disposition. All of that is -- we do provide all the detail in our periodic filings as a footnote within our financial statement that we lay out every quarter where the costs are being incurred in detail. But with respect to the $250 million of costs in 2014, what we're anticipating are largely cash costs.", "Robert J. Marshall", "Toni, we have time for one additional question.", "Operator", "Okay. Your final question comes from the line of Bill Plovanic with Canaccord Genuity.", "William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "I'm only going to ask one. I mean, Persona is a big product for you, I was wondering if you could categorize for us where are you in the launch stages of that product in terms of new customers, existing customers and then geographically? If you could break that out, that'd be helpful.", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure. I would tell you that this -- it's still early with the launch of Persona. Pick an analogy or metaphor, I think it's the first quarter, not halftime, with that launch. It's going to be phased with additional elements launched over an extended period of time. And then there's going to be a geographic prioritization. So we are primarily focused on the U.S. market at this point in time, selectively outside the U.S. market in 2013 and in 2014. So it's going to be a launch process that lasts for multiple operating periods. And I think you ought to think about that product launch as kind of a 3- to 5-year, as opposed to a 12- to 24-month process, Bill.", "William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "And have you completed the rollout to the U.S. geography and all your existing physicians, or are you still working through that process?", "David C. Dvorak", "It's ongoing. And there's a lot left to do in that regard. We have a lot of opportunity going forward with the Persona system.", "William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "And then have you -- in terms of competitive approaches, I would assume that you've started that and that's part of the contribution from this year. But as we think about that, is that really a 2014, a 2015, where you really start going heavy after competitive accounts or is that a dual track, where it's both the existing and the competitive at the same time?", "David C. Dvorak", "The latter really, Bill, and that was the case in 2013 as well. I would tell you that probably somewhat uniquely with this launch, because of the interest and the appetite among competitive surgeons, there have been more set placements into the hands of competitive surgeons. So it will be dual track and last for multiple operating periods, not just 2013 nor will it just be 2014 in that regard.", "William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "And lastly, for clarification, just on the o U.S., you mentioned selective in '13 and '14, so we should really think that, that becomes a full push in '15 and beyond? Or does that kind of build as we're exiting '14?", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure, Bill. It will build as we move on. But again, there'll be different elements and different compositions that -- and forms that the Persona launch will take and the intelligent instruments that are very importantly incorporated into the launch. So we'll package that up in different ways for different markets, but it will be ongoing for the coming operating periods. And we'll offer more color on that as the launch continues so that you have some perspective on how much runway we have. At this point in time, the answer is, a great deal.", "And so with that, I'd like to just, again thank everyone for joining the call today and for your continued interest and support for Zimmer. We look forward to speaking to you on our first quarter conference call, which is scheduled for 8:00 a.m. on April 24.

I'm here with the CEO, David Dvorak; and our CFO, Jim Crines who discussing this morning\u2019s announcement regarding the combination of Zimmer Biomet. We will also briefly cover Zimmer\u2019s First Quarter 2014 financial results announced separately this morning. We will be using a presentation this morning which is available on our website for download and is also currently available on the SEC's website as exhibit 99.2 to the Form 8-K we filed this morning.", "Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.", "Also, the discussions during this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations with these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included within the earnings release, which is available on our website at investor.zimmer.com.", "With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jim who will provide an overview of our quarter results and guidance before passing call to David to discuss the Biomet transaction. Jim?", "Jim Crines", "", "Thank you Bob. I know you\u2019re all anxious to hear more about the announcement, we issued this morning regarding our definitive agreement with Biomet. I will therefore keep my comments in our first quarter performance brief. Our total revenues for the first quarter were $1.161 billion a 3.2% constant currency increase compared to the first quarter of 2013. Net currency impact for the quarter decreased revenues by 1.2% or $14 million, our adjusted gross profit margin was 74.4% for the quarter, a more favorable mix of products and geographic revenues together with foreign currency hedge gains, cost savings from our operational excellence initiatives and reduced excess and obsolescence charges effectively offset the impact of negative price and increased head wind for the medical device tax in the quarter.", "The company\u2019s R&D expense decreased 11.1% or $6 million on a reported basis to 4.1% of net sales when compared to the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $464 million in the first quarter and at 40% of sales were 50 basis points below the prior year. We continue to make significant progress in realizing savings from our operational excellence programs while continuing to invest in selling, distribution and marketing cost in support of the commercialization of a number of new products.", "In the quarter the company recorded pretax charges of 45.9 million in special items and 7.7 million in cost of product sold pertaining to global restructuring, quality and operational excellence initiatives and recent acquisitions. Adjusted first quarter 2014 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these charges.", "Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to $352 million at 30.3%; our adjusted operating profit to sale ratio was 100 basis points higher than the prior year first quarter. A significant improvement in our adjusted operating margin in the quarter reflects to the progress we have made in restoring growth to certain geographic markets and higher margin product categories within our musculoskeletal portfolio. Net interest expense for the quarter amounted to $12.5 million which was favorable when compared to the prior year quarter. Adjusted net earnings were $258.1 million for the first quarter an increase of 7.2% compared to the prior year, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 6.4% to a $1.50 on a 171.8 million average outstanding diluted shares.", "At a $1.29 reported diluted earnings per share increased 0.8% from the prior year first quarter reported EPS of a $1.28. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.1% and was 70 basis points favorable when compared to prior year due to the recognition of a tax benefit relating to an international reorganization of certain of our subsidiaries. I would like to turn now to guidance for Zimmer as a standalone enterprise for 2014 which in many respects is unchanged from prior guidance but in one fact it has impacted [technical difficulty] change first discussing revenues in other operating measures.", "In earnings release this morning we reiterated that the company expects full year of 2014 revenues to increase between 3% and 5% constant currency when compared to 2013. We continue to expect foreign translation to decrease our reported 2014 revenues by approximately 0.5% for the full year. Therefore on a reported basis our revenues are projected to be between 2.5% and 4.5% above 2013 results. For the second quarter reflecting seasonality consistent with the prior year as well as the loss of a billing day we expect revenues to increase between 2% and 3% both on a constant currency and on a reported basis when compared to the prior year. As a result of the pending transaction announced this morning we have suspended our share repurchase program in order to preserve capital for funding of the acquisition. Consequently we now expect the fully diluted share count to be approximately a 171.5 million shares in the second quarter and approximately a 172 million for the full year.", "This compares with our prior guidance for diluted weighted average shares outstanding for 2014 of approximately 169 million shares. The higher share count has the effect of lowering our expectation for full year adjusted diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.10. The company now expects fully year 2014 adjusted diluted earnings per share to be within a range of $6 to $6.20.", "Prior full year guidance had been in the range of $6.10 to $6.30. As previously indicated to arrive at our anticipated reported GAAP earnings per share and you should subtract total charges for special items of $250 million pretax or approximately $1.10 per share. Taking into account our lower anticipated hedge gains in the near term as well as the higher share count second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.46 to $1.49.", "Finally our guidance does not include the anticipated cost associated with the impacts from the jointly announced pending transaction with Biomet or other unforeseen events. David I will now turn the call back over to you.", "David Dvorak", "Thanks Jim. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us this morning. I\u2019m excited to talk with you about the announcement we issued this morning regarding our definitive agreement with Biomet. This milestone combination creates a leading innovator in the musculoskeletal industry that we believe will deliver significant benefits to patients, providers and all of our healthcare stakeholders. Together we will be better positioned to shape solutions for the evolving healthcare industry. Let me start with an overview of the terms of the transaction which is on slide 5 of the document that Bob referred to. Under the merger agreement Zimmer will acquire Biomet for a combination of $10.35 billion in cash and aggregate number of shares of Zimmer common stock valued at $3 billion.", "Upon completion Biomet shareholders will own approximately 16% of the combined company and will have two representatives on the Board which will be expanded accordingly. The transaction is not contingent upon financing which is fully committed. Finally the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2015 subject to customary approvals. Turning to slide 7, Biomet\u2019s financial and operational profile will bring significant value to Zimmer and is highly consistent with the value creation framework that we used to guide our strategy.", "Many of you on this call have probably heard us discuss our value creation framework and you can see that this combination is consistent with the guiding principles illustration by the three pillars of our strategy, growth, operational excellence and prudent capital allocation.", "This combination is certainly about growth, together the combined company will be more competitive in our knee and hip franchises with a more diverse revenue base to increase scale and faster growing markets in adjacent categories.", "We will also gain meaningful entry into sports medicine and we will have a research and development teams that will power and enhance innovation. Operationally these complimentary businesses are ideal partners; together we will accelerator our opportunity to transform the business model to meet the needs to meet the needs of the evolving healthcare industry. At the same time we expect to achieve approximately $270 million synergies by 2017 with approximately $135 million anticipated in the first year.", "Additionally we expect to source the funding necessary to grow and deliver anticipated double digit accretion to adjusted earnings per share to our stockholders. This transaction is also consistent our disciplined approach to mergers and acquisitions. In the near to medium term we will focus free cash flow on debt repayment and dividends and then suspend share repurchases as Jim mentioned.", "We expect a strong cash flow to enhance the combined company\u2019s future financial flexibility and to allow us to continue to support necessary capital investments as well as maintain a stable dividend of 15% to 20% net income following the closing of the transaction.", "Jim will discuss our anticipated capital structure profile in more detail, however with Biomet we will generate increased cash flows through working capital efficiencies that come with scale which positions us well to pay down the debt overtime so that we can maintain and improve our investment grade credit ratings.", "This next series of slides beginning of slide 8 take a deeper dive into how we expect to be able to shape our musculoskeletal solutions are developed and delivered. Our success will be in our ability to leverage the combined experience and capabilities of both companies. To offer more personalized solutions that benefit patients across the continuum of care.", "Our combined company will be supported by a research and development spend capability of approximately $360 million and will immediately benefit from a combined portfolio of innovative solutions as well as efficiencies gained from combining each companies respective R&D effort. Over the longer term our combined R&D spend will allow us to more rapidly bring to market a broad portfolio of musculoskeletal products, technologies and services. And do so more efficiently than ever before.", "This includes game changing solutions in category such as early intervention and joint preservation, personalized devices, intelligent instrumentation as well as value based offerings for emerging markets. In short this combination allows for the development of clinically relevant solutions for our patients while equally important creating efficiencies for providers and payers. Overall we\u2019re bringing together the best of the best to create new solutions that address stakeholder challenges in the evolving healthcare environment.", "Moving to slide 9, our combined portfolio in innovation capabilities underscore how Zimmer and Biomet will create a leader in the $45 billion musculoskeletal industry. We will have enhanced diversification and strong scalable platforms in faster growing sports medicine, extremities and trauma product categories.", "This together with enhanced scale and other categories will benefit the full spectrum of our key constituents and address current market demands while also growing the market in other category such as knees, hips, surgical spine and dental. Slide 10 underscores the strengths and advantages of our combined workforce. We\u2019re excited that this combination will allow us to bring together the best talent in the industry committed to medical training and education.", "Both companies have strong sales force teams to achieve cross selling opportunities as early as day one. We believe it will be better positioned to deliver business model innovations that benefit providers and patients. With the right mix of solutions together we can provide cost effective ways to reduce complications and readmissions and it will benefit the overall market and result in an increased patient satisfaction.", "We\u2019re further dedicated to maintaining a long term commitment to our combined skilled labor force. Our expertise in manufacturing will remain critical to our ongoing success and bring life to the innovations we develop.", "Of course we expect all of these benefits to enhance value for our stockholders. As we outline on slide 11, the combined company will have solid fundamentals through a more diversified and predictable revenue mix and generate significant cash flow. We expect double digit accretion to adjusted earnings in the first year following closing. In addition return on invested capital from the transaction is expected to exceed cost of capital by the end of year three with enterprise return on invested capital expected to exceed the weighted average cost of capital in year one.", "With that I will turn it over to Jim who will take you through more a detailed on the pro forma financial profile combined portfolio as well as our integration plans.", "Jim Crines", "Thanks David. Slide 13, shows a pro forma business mix by category for the combined company. A pro forma combined revenue footprint on a full year 2013 basis was $7.8 billion with $4.62 billion Company from Zimmer and 3.14 billion from Biomet. Through this combination we will enhance the scale and competitiveness of all of our product franchises with each product category measuring no less than 500 million in size in three of our franchises with over 1 billion plus [ph] of revenue.", "Knees will be the company\u2019s largest category accounting for 37% of the combined businesses pro forma revenue or 2.8 billion on a 2013 basis. The combination of Zimmer and Biomet will create a broad portfolio of solutions and the latest advances in the knee arthroplasty by combining best in class implants and intelligent instrumentation. Our combined hip business will be the company\u2019s second largest category on a revenue basis making up 26% of the overall business or 2 billion in revenue. This transaction gives us a platform for industry leading innovation and new growth in this area as well as a more complete portfolio to address the continuum of care.", "The third largest category of the combined company will be sports medicine, extremities and trauma which together will comprise 15% of the overall business and 1.2 billion of 2013 combined revenue. By combining Biomet\u2019s emerging sports medicine business with Zimmer\u2019s highly differentiated early intervention devices we will be better able to offer competitive and attractive solution to customers. ", "We will also benefit from strengthening our presence in emerging markets and an extended portfolio that covers upper and lower joints which will position us to grow our extremities and trauma business going forward. In the surgical, biologics and other category this combination allows for increased cross selling of surgical and other devices through combined global reconstructing sales channels and together with Biomet we expect to establish critical mass in both spine and dental that will position the company to compete effectively and gain share in these important markets.", "As you can see from slide 14, this combination creates an even compelling opportunity for our stakeholders as the second largest player in the global musculoskeletal industry with the 17% share of overall revenues. We believe this will enhance our competitiveness while leaving room for new growth in this $45 billion industry.", "Slide 16 provides an overview of the operating earning synergies, we expect to realize from this combination. We expect to achieve approximately 270 million of net annual synergies by the third year of post-closing which represents approximately 8% of acquired revenue. In addition we anticipate approximately 135 million of synergies in the first year. This is consistent with precedent medical device acquisition synergies and it's in-line with the synergies we achieved through our acquisition of Centerpulse.", "These operating synergies take into account anticipated effects of the transaction on revenues considering the cross selling opportunities together with potential disruption as the two companies are integrated. We expect revenues to grow in-line with the market in the short term post combination and when the integration is complete we would expect all categories to be growing ahead of their respective markets given the breadth of scale and the global reach of a combined sales channels. Key sources of synergies from the combination include cross selling opportunities, strategic sourcing, advanced manufacturing, simplifying instrument designs, consolidated distribution and logistics, streamline development initiatives and the elimination of redundant corporate costs.", "Now I would like to spend a few minutes addressing our integration approach. We recognized the Zimmer and Biomet have highly recognizable and well respected names and following a closing of the transaction the combined company will conduct business under a consolidated name that will leverage the strength of both brands.", "As David said earlier, this transaction is about achieving scale, innovation, synergies and growth. Slide 17, outlines in detail our key objectives of proposed high level timeline for our integration plans. We will soon establish a joint steering committee that will oversee this process across all aspects of the business as we prepare for day one success and steady state operations. We intend to capture deal value and ensure optimal execution through proactive involvement by both Zimmer and Biomet management [technical difficulty].", "We\u2019re confident in our ability to successfully integrate this transaction and we have a track record of successfully integrating companies both large and small including the major integration with Centerpulse as well as the integrations of multiple other acquisitions.", "While we\u2019re on the topic of integration and before I turn the call back over to David, with the confirmation of this deal we intend to exclude amortization of intangible assets in deferred transaction related financing cost from our adjusted earnings measure post combination. For purposes of measuring the anticipated accretion on the transaction we first added back approximately 90 million of intangible asset, amortization on a pretax basis or approximately $0.40 per diluted share on an after tax basis to Zimmer\u2019s standalone full year adjusted earnings.", "I will now pass the presentation back over to David for some concluding remarks.", "David Dvorak", "Thanks Jim. Before we take your questions I would like to briefly recap the announced merger. We continue to adhere to our core value creation strategy to focus on growth, operational excellence and prudent capital allocation. Biomet is a perfect fit for us and the transaction is directly in-line with the strategy to create significant value and provide attractive growth and profitability over the long term.", "Zimmer and Biomet will create an innovation leader in the $45 billion musculoskeletal industry with a more comprehensive and scalable portfolio of solutions and cross selling opportunities.", "We will have enhanced musculoskeletal diversification and strong scalable platforms in faster growing sports medicine, extremities and trauma product categories. All of this increased scale will provide significant operating efficiencies and will benefit all constituents and address the evolving healthcare environment. Zimmer\u2019s and Biomet\u2019s market growth prospects coupled with strong cash flow will support our ongoing commitments to debt repayment and dividends. ", "Finally all of these actions will be led by experienced management teams from both sides, with an impressive track record of successful execution and integration. We look forward to entering this exciting new chapter of our company\u2019s history and working with the Biomet team to advance our shared goals of driving innovation to benefit stakeholders.", "With that I will now turn the call back over to Toni for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So couple of questions I would love to ask here, first of all I want to make sure we ask the question on FTC in terms of what kind of conversations you\u2019ve had on that front and specifically I would love to know what you think your combined market share in the United States in hips, knees and shoulder you know post-closing of the transaction.", "David Dvorak", "Bob. I would tell you that we had the benefit of experts reviewing that subject matter, obviously. We're very well advised and I think the important thing to keep in mind is that this is a $45 billion industry. We\u2019re quite confident that we will complete the transaction and at this point in time believe that the transaction be consummated in the first quarter of 2015. The market share numbers are publically available; you understand that our market share in general in most markets in knees is in the mid-20s. Biomet\u2019s is double digits to lower teens, and in hips, our market share is closer to 20%, their market share is in similar range and that\u2019s applicable to most geographies but as I said we\u2019re quite confident that we\u2019re going to be able to move through that process and that the transaction at this point in time is contemplated to be closed as of the first quarter of 2015.", "Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And then in terms of two quick follow-ups, one I just wanted to make sure I have the earnings guidance correct. So you\u2019re saying that in the first full year post the close double digit accretion relative to a cash EPS number and I was wondering if you could be a little bit more explicit on the double digits, I mean is that 10% to 15% or is that more, that\u2019s one thing and then the other thing I like to ask about is relates to the guidance is on the synergies and the synergies seem to me to be about 7% of the combined companies operating expenses which seems a little late. I would expect that there might be even more synergies given that you guys are both located in the same town and then financial I was wondering are you contemplating sort of the normal hip and knee disruption that we have seen in previous mergers of maybe a little bit over 1% just would love a comment on those things and then I will drop. Thank you.", "Jim Crines", "Just to be sort of more specific on what we mean by double digit accretion in a range and you\u2019re right that it's on a something more akin to a cash earnings measure is what I indicated in my remarks, post the combination we will be adding back amortization of intangible assets as well as amortization of transaction related to financing fees to arrive at our adjusted earnings measure.", "We are anticipating in the range of 15% to 20% and more specifically accretion in the range of a $1.15 to a $1.25 in the first year. That does and the synergies the 270 million by the third year, 135 million by the first year. That does take into account both the cross selling opportunities that we feel are substantial with respect to the combination and anticipated disruption that will occur as a consequence of integrating the two companies on the top line. We\u2019re not going to be more specific than that. I would just tell you as I indicated in my remarks that post the combination we would expect the top line revenues to be growing in-line with the market and then once we get through the integration we have the opportunity for all of those product categories to be growing ahead of the market. As I said given the enhanced scale and competitiveness of those various product portfolios.", "Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And then on the synergy side just the 7% number?", "Jim Crines", "I would tell you, David talked about, we see significant opportunity to be reinvesting in innovation that will include not just the sort of traditional products innovation that these companies within this industry are better known for but as well it is going to be very focused on taking advantage or the opportunity to invest more money in business model innovation. So I think it's fair to believe that the synergy opportunities are significant but as I said the combination is going to present us with an opportunity to reinvest some of those synergies and that as well is something we have taken into account in the 270 million that we have guided to.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JP Morgan.", "Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan", "As a starting point can you just clarify during what Biomet\u2019s (indiscernible) are assuming that touches about $6 billion. It sound like you\u2019re not assuming their debt with the cash that Biomet will use to pay down their debt. So can you just clarify what balances you will be taking along?", "Jim Crines", "I will tell you -- sorry Mike, somewhere in the neighborhood of net debt of estimated at around $5.5 billion that we would assume in pay down following the combination.", "Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan", "And so that is not that you want to get balance sheet, I just want to make sure this is clear. So the you\u2019re not paying, you\u2019re not assuming that your (indiscernible) Biomet will be used to pay down that debt.", "Jim Crines", "That set will be refinanced. Out of the total value 13.35 billion, as we indicated 3 billion of that will be consideration will be provided in the form of Zimmer shares and the balance in cash. So the 5.5 billion of debt that we\u2019re going to be assuming will effectively get refinanced through the combinations.", "Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan", "So you will be assuming 5.5 billion of debt and walk me through the (indiscernible) of cash comes from?", "Jim Crines", "Sure. So it will come from a combination of senior notes, so it will be through the financing that we will raise which will be comprised of a combination of senior notes somewhere in the neighborhood of around 7.5 million of bond financing and 3 billion in the form of syndicated term loan.", "Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan", "You\u2019re expecting your closed offering to be about 11 billion, is that what you\u2019re suggesting?", "Jim Crines", "That\u2019s correct. So if you take that over 10 billion that I referenced and add the 1 billion of debt that they have already on our balance sheet, total debt is somewhere north of 11 billion for the combined period.", "Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan", "And you\u2019re not assuming you'll be able to use any of your O-US cash limited cash on your balance sheet that majority is outside the U.S. is that correct?", "Jim Crines", "We will be able to access somewhere between 0.5 billion to a 1 billion of offshore cash and that will go towards covering some of the -- towards funding for the combination as well as paying for some of the transaction cost associated with it, the combination.", "Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan", "", "And then last question, just thought process on this. If I look at the first quarter activity, you bought back a lot of stock in the first quarter it looks like it's about $400 million in stock. So it didn\u2019t look like you spent the quarter thinking about acquiring Biomet, it looks like you went along with your normal operating plan and that this came together relatively recently. Can you just talk David about what drove the decision to do this? It sounded like something that management was not inclined to do as recent recently as six months ago, conversations with the Street.", "David Dvorak", "I will tell you this is very consistent with the strategic plans that we have developed over the last several operating periods Mike and the complimentary nature of these businesses allows us to accelerate many of the initiatives that are common to the two entities and so strategically this is a fit that can be seen going back sometime as these things go circumstances arise in a confluence of events that bring us to the point of actually having the capability to combine the entities and those processes once they get going can happen and need to happen in a fairly accelerated fashion. So I think you\u2019re right, over the last several weeks it has been a concentrated effort and the perspective on what we\u2019re going to do consistent with our disciplined capital allocation changed quite recently.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Taylor with Barclays Capital.", "", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital", "", "I just wanted to I guess understand, you talked a little bit about some of the revenue and P&L synergies, just from a high level can you help us understand how this impacts some of the R&D projects and how you will approach selling some of it combined portfolio, are you going to kind portfolio that you\u2019re going to kind of cheery pick some of the best products and shelf some of the other ones or should we generally view the comments about some of the pipeline activities as on track?", "David Dvorak", "We will leverage the capabilities of both organizations. I think there is mutual respect for the innovation, skill sets within both of these organizations and culture as it relates to innovation. So if you think about the combination of these businesses with concentrations in various product categories and the way innovation has been conducted over the course of many years within medical devices is -- there is an element of that innovation that is committed to incremental advancements and those will always continue whether it's in the form of line extensions or the like, what this transaction allows us to do it on a combined basis is continue incremental innovation and yet have a broader portfolio and array of innovative solutions that are going to be game changing, broader in the form of joint preservation and early intervention technologies and advance the cause in preoperative and interoperative technologies that can help change the way these solutions are delivered and the efficiencies with which these solutions are delivered.", "So on a combined basis we\u2019re going to be able to get after rapidly addressing more of the current unmet needs and then as Jim and both referenced in a more comprehensive way partner with other stakeholders in the healthcare industry in a manner that allows them to improve patient care and at the same time do that in a cost effective manner. So we\u2019re going to be able to do all the things that we have done historically on a standalone basis but when combined more of it and on an accelerated basis across a broader span of the innovation opportunity and the scope of addressing the problems and challenges that other stakeholders face in an evolving health care market.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital", "And just on your synergy commentary. I wanted to understand you gave us targets of 135 and 270 and talked about reinvestment, could there be upside to those synergies, are those numbers are really targeting and you would probably reinvest some of that upside if you were tracking ahead of schedule.", "Jim Crines", "Yes I would just tell you that we have a very high degree of confidence in our ability to deliver on the 135 million and the 270 million. I would also acknowledge that we do believe over the long term there are going to be some significant balance sheet related cash flow synergies that are not sort of fully reflected if you will and what we anticipate to be able to achieve in the way of deleveraging over the short term. So to the extend we can execute as well on those opportunities, that\u2019s going to provide some more opportunity for us to pay down the debt perhaps a little more quickly and drive some additional sort of accretion in bottom-line earnings.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs", "I want to just start with David you have made a couple of references to the quote evolving healthcare landscape, could you maybe be a little bit more specific on where exactly you see your markets going and then how this combination makes you more competitive in that marketplace than what you would have been otherwise?", "David Dvorak", "Sure I think the theme to that really is we need to work in closer relationships with providers, surgeon\u2019s integrated healthcare systems whether they are private or national and their orientation across the global. In a matter that allows us together provide better patient outcomes and solutions but at the same time do that cost effectively. This portfolio of existing products, technologies allows us to engage in those discussions and partner in ways that we believe is going to be very comprehensive and deep and to help work together towards addressing any of the challenges that exists whether it is a patient outcome challenge or a cost efficiency challenge. So for instance in the patient paradigm or algorithm to the extent that we can partner with a healthcare institution and ensure that the right intervention strategy and solution is offered to that surgeon in treating the patient irrespective of where they are in the disease state or continuum of care, all the way up through joint replacement or revision that\u2019s a real advantage to the systems, to the extent that we can more intelligently deliver those solutions through preoperative planning systems or assist within our operative technologies to ensure that procedure goes as best as it possibly can and complications are avoided, readmissions are mitigated that\u2019s a real advantage to that system as well as the patients.", "And when we refer to a comprehensive portfolio it isn't merely just the product portfolio on a traditional sense, we\u2019re able to put together integrated services and comprehensive solutions that will enable us to partner with the other stakeholders and later bring those solutions about in a cost effective manner.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs", "And then as you kind of think about that full patient continuum of care that you referenced from early intervention to full joint replacement, is there a piece of that treatment paradigm that you really think you\u2019re missing right now and is that something that Biomet brings to you and is there any way to sort of quantify maybe clinical revenue synergy from being able to capture a greater percentage of the patient for treatment?", "David Dvorak", "I think there are absolutely platform technologies that Biomet possess that are complimentary to the ones that we possess and are continuing to develop. So it's going to be an accelerator when we are able to put those technologies and services and solutions together and I think in other dimension I neglected to state in response to the first part of your question David it's just the fact that we know that the industry that we\u2019re serving is going to consolidate the hospital system et cetera, so they are going to be looking for saving as well by partnering with fewer vendors that can offer a fuller portfolio of solutions and that\u2019s going to be an advantage along with these integrated services. So by way of example I would tell you that an acquisition that we did 7 or so years ago that is ORTHOsoft, that is headquartered in Montreal, they've done a terrific job of advancing preoperative technologies as well as intraoperative technologies and if you think about the deployment of these solutions, an preoperative that helps the hospital, the surgeon, the OR staff as well as this company yet the right implant, instrument set et cetera into the treatment path and then allow in a most efficient way that procedure it takes place in the OR and optimize that patient outcome and minimize the reprocessing costs and central sterilization et cetera which is what that solution base is all about that we have been developing and again Biomet is been developing services that are very complimentary to that, that can create a lot of value for everyone.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs", "Last one, just in that context we hear about cross selling and I think some companies dub it size and scale or bundling. How do you prevent the conversation from being about price and to what extent do you think I guess the scale you\u2019re gaining here and the more consolidated nature of the hip and knee market can arrest some of the pricing decline we have seen accelerate over the past several quarters.", "David Dvorak", "And I think what we\u2019re talking about is putting together integrated solutions that have a value proposition associated with them, so by addressing unmet clinical needs, by minimizing readmissions by helping reduce infection those have incredible value creation opportunities associated with it and innovating in those regards is going to be rewarded in the marketplace.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.", "David Lewis - Morgan Stanley", "Jim, I just want to come back to a comment you made earlier about the accretion and potential disruption. I think you said that your earnings accretion does forecast some assumption for disruption, but I can't remember if it was David or yourself who mentioned that in the intermediate term you expect to grow in-line with market in your core franchises and then faster than the market in the future, which implies that you're not assuming much disruption in the near term. Can you just reconcile the revenue statement with the earnings statement?", "Jim Crines", "Sure. Again I did say with respect to the revenues that in the aggregate and if you\u2019re taking all of the various product categories we would expect in the short term post-combinations that total revenues would be growing in-line with the overall market. And then as we complete the integration our belief very firmly that we\u2019re going to have the opportunity for all of those product categories to be growing above market. So that\u2019s sort of in-line growth expectation for the short term as I said does take into account some anticipated disruption as we work through the integration which will impart be offset by some significant cross selling opportunities that we have as and we have talked about both in our scripted remarks and in responses to some of the questions that has been raised. ", " David Lewis - Morgan Stanley", "Maybe just two quick follow ups. The first interesting thing Jim for me on this transaction is you had about $200 million left on a Zimmer specific restructuring, which you were well on your pace of completing and you're talking about this transaction of having synergies of about $270 million. Can you help us understand what happens to that $200 million, is that number fully maintained? Are there opportunities to roll in Biomet into some of the ongoing activity there and maybe accelerate that $270 million number?", "Jim Crines", "So I think you\u2019re right to assume that $200 million is fully maintained. The initiatives have already been mapped out so that the project teams are assembled, the work plans are in place that they have been and continue to execute and will continue to execute obviously through the closing of this transaction and we have talked about the fact that with respect to what it takes to get from what we have already achieved that of the total $400 million that we\u2019re targeting. The latter half of that much of that is in the manufacturing area, it gets -- take some time for that to work through the P&L and it first shows up in lower inventory cost and then eventually shows up in the P&L.", "So that $200 million if you reference David is fully maintained in with respect to the expectations going forward.", "David Lewis - Morgan Stanley", "Just quick one for David. Just more strategic and I'll jump back in queue. David wrong, right, or indifferent, everyone's going to look to Centerpulse as the referenceable transaction for this deal, and I wonder if you could share with us just if you compare sort of the environment then versus now, the asset you're acquiring then versus now, maybe you could share sort of challenges and maybe some concerns if there are any about why Centerpulse is and is not a good referenceable transaction for this deal. Thank you.", "David Dvorak", "Sure. Well I think it's a referenceable transaction with respect to the experience on integrating companies that if you look at the size of that integration relevant to where Zimmer was as a standalone entity after the spinoff back in 2003, it's relatively comparable. There is a lot of institutional knowledge and experience that resides in Zimmer today that led that transaction including Jim and I were both personally involved and highly involved in the integration, and the thing that I would say is differentiated in this regard is that the Biomet team has a terrific skillset in that regard, and a great success rate.", "So we\u2019re going to partner and the steering committee and leadership to develop integration plan in a very specific way, will be balanced and representative of both organizations and as successful as Centerpulse was I\u2019m very optimistic that this transaction will be, will come together and will take the best of the best in processes and capabilities for both of these organizations and create an even stronger entity on a combined basis. So very optimistic about how we\u2019re going to be able to run this integration.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "Couple follow-ups here. You talked about a bunch of different angles of the transaction, but Jim, I just wanted to understand, you mentioned that there are some potential further sort of cash and working capital oriented synergies with the combined organization. And I just want to understand whether those are included in your initial estimates or if things like distribution synergies or hubbing or field level kind of efficiencies of instruments and working capital are in your estimates or not at this point?", "Jim Crines", "Well some of what you reference would be included in the estimated operating earning synergies, the 270 million but not at this stage reflected Matt in cash flow, it's not fully reflected in cash flow synergies to the extent that we\u2019re going to be able to lower the amount of capital we have tied up in inventory and instrument. So that something that has to be sort of more specifically mapped out as a team has the opportunity over the next many months to get into more detailed integration planning.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "And then again, clarification on your thoughts on some of the dissynergies. We all know that these kinds of transactions can lead to some attrition or loss of business between the two organizations. But when you talk about growing with the market it sounds like if I can read through your comments that we have two businesses that individually we would expect to be growing above market for reasons having to do with product cycles or momentum or whatever, and during this period of integration you're sort of ratcheting that back to with market to be reaccelerated again post integration. Is that a fair way to look at the growth expectations?", "Jim Crines", "That\u2019s exactly the -- precisely the right way to look at it.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "And then finally, there were some different geographic elements of the Centerpulse deal compared to the Biomet deal in terms of complementary nature of the different kinds of organizations out there at the time. But I don't know how much detail you're willing to get into at this point, but I'd love to understand what the different characteristics are of the U.S. distribution footprint. We think of Biomet as being kind of maybe more present in the community setting and Zimmer perhaps more is present in the academic setting traditionally. Love to understand how those two organizations sort of start coming together over time and your thoughts on that would be very helpful.", "David Dvorak", "Yes. I think there is a lot of complimentary aspects of the distribution channel and not just limited to the United States, OUS markets as well Matt and if you look at the product categories that is in fact the case, we haven't focused as much on what this does to us from a scale standpoint and the non-large joint categories but it's a significant difference maker when you look at the faster growing markets of sports medicine, extremities and trauma for instance and then as well we were talking about doubling the size of spine business, doubling the size of the dental business and again there is a very complimentary aspect to some of those business distribution channels for instance. Biomet\u2019s dental business is very strong in certain OUS markets where we are relatively absent.", "So there is going to be a lot more to be able to talk about in that regard as we move forward Matt but we see it as a terrific opportunity as well as big dimensions of cross selling capabilities with the relationships that exist across those various markets and you take a business unit like our surgical business that really isn't fully built out and Biomet\u2019s portfolio and we\u2019re going to be able to cross sell those products successfully into those accounts and relationships. And as Jim referenced earlier some of the earlier intervention and joint preservation technologies that are part of our portfolio are going to be successfully sold into their sports medicine.", "So I think there are going to be wonderful opportunities with a broader portfolio, the leverage of those relationships and capabilities across the globe and across the various product categories. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein", "Starting with the transaction, I was wondering if you could give us any color on whether this might have been any kind of -- any sort of competitive bidding process involved with the deal and if there might be any provisions within the deal to prevent a competitive bidder from stepping in.", "Jim Crines", "We have obviously as the securities fillings -- there will be a full element of disclosure embodied in those documents and the background of the process and I don\u2019t want to speak on behalf of the Biomet organization in that regard Derrick, but you'll gain whatever insights that disclosure will reveal about the background and process here. Suffice to say that transaction agreements provide support from the major sponsors and that disclosure will be very specific as well but we\u2019re very confident in the ability to consummate the transaction.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein", "And as you think about your portfolio and the portfolio that Biomet has, there's obviously a lot of overlap there in your hip and knee categories, but there are obviously some differences here, and I was wondering if you could talk about what aspects perhaps of the Biomet portfolio you're most excited about. Obviously they're coming out with their bicruciate knee. And then longer term, do you envision continuing to basically have two sort of lines of offerings if you will, or is there a longer-term opportunity to maybe streamline your product portfolio as the integration unfolds?", "David Dvorak ", "I think that the comprehensive nature of the portfolio is pretty recognizable if you move up and down the continuum of care Derrick. I think that as we have expressed there are early intervention technologies and joint preservation technologies for example our Gel-One product on the front end of that continuum of care and there are sports medicine products and technologies on the front end of that continuum all the way through comprehensive revision systems and salvage systems. So you can line that up, plot whatever point on that continuum you\u2019re most interested in and you\u2019ve a terrific offering when this come together that I think is going to really be a difference maker for the customers that we\u2019re partnering with.", "So I think that that is an incredible benefit that\u2019s going to be seen as very valuable from the customer\u2019s perspective.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Just a simple question. Have you put contracts in place to hold people into place? And how are you dealing with employees at this stage? Warsaw can be seen as a small community. Thank you.", "David Dvorak", "Sure Joanne. We will be very proactive on that front, there will be programs put in place to address any of the risks that you just referenced. I think that overall as it relates to your second question, Warsaw, this transaction cements Warsaw as at a global basis the musculoskeletal innovation capital of the world and we\u2019re going to be able to accelerate the planning and upon consummation of the deal accelerate the integration efforts to leverage the fact that the value systems are very common, the geography is going to be beneficial. The commitment customers and enhancing the quality of life for patients provide such a common bond and platform to bring these organizations together that we're extraordinarily confident in our ability to address the risks and leverage the opportunities that this combination represents.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Thank you very much and congratulations.", "David Dvorak", "Thank you Joanne. So with that I would just state that we very much look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter conference call which is scheduled for 8 a.m. on July 24. I will turn the call back to you Toni.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference call.

Crines - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Finance", "Analysts", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "William J.

Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Jonathan Demchick - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Operator", "Good morning. I would like to turn the call over to Bob Marshall, Vice President, Investor Relations, and Treasurer. Mr. Marshall, you may begin your call.", "Robert J. Marshall", "Thank you, Regina. Good morning, and welcome to Zimmer's Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. I'm here with our CEO, David Dvorak; and our CFO, Jim Crines.", "Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties. Also, the discussions during this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included within the earnings release, which is available on our website at investor.zimmer.com.", "With that, I'll now turn the call over to David.", "David C. Dvorak", "Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call for the second quarter of 2014. This morning, I'll review our second quarter financial results, providing commentary on the year's progress to date and highlights from our performance. Jim will then provide additional financial details. I'll state all sales in constant currency terms and all earnings results on an adjusted basis.", "In the second quarter, Zimmer recorded solid sales gains across various categories of our differentiated portfolio of musculoskeletal solutions, most notably in key overseas markets. Consolidated net sales for the quarter were $1.18 billion, an increase of 0.9%. And our earnings per share were $1.49, an increase of 4.2% over the prior year period. In the second quarter, Americas sales declined by 2.7% year-over-year, while Europe, Middle East and Africa increased by 4.9%, and the Asia Pacific region grew 6.9%. I'd like to remind you that these results include the consolidated impact of 1 less billing day in the quarter. We sustained healthy traction overseas, inclusive of strong performances in key emerging markets.", "In the second half of the year, we'll heighten our focus on improving U.S. performance by leveraging our comprehensive portfolio of clinically proven solutions, as well as our robust pipeline of new and recently commercialized products. Those familiar with Zimmer's value creation framework will know that we're dedicated to consistently creating and returning value for our stockholders. In keeping with that strategy, Zimmer once again delivered against our financial commitments in the second quarter of 2014, while increasing the quarterly dividend and expanding operating margins relative to the prior year period.", "Our operational excellence programs also continued to drive disciplined expense management as highlighted by the ongoing successes from our strategic sourcing initiatives. And as part of Zimmer's ongoing commitment to quality improvement, we continue to fund enhancements of all aspects of our quality management system. As we've communicated in previous quarters, this focused work will continue as part of our quality and operational excellence agenda.", "Before discussing our results in greater detail, I'd like to first comment on market and pricing conditions. In the second quarter, underlying global market dynamics were stable and generally consistent with sequential seasonality experienced in previous operating periods. Turning to pricing, Zimmer experienced a price decline of 2.8% in the quarter, which was in line with expectations coming into the year. The sequential movement from the first quarter of 2014 was largely attributable to the anticipated biannual Japanese price adjustment.", "Turning now to our business units. Knee sales for the second quarter increased 3.5%, reflecting positive volume and mix of 7.3% and negative price of 3.8%. Our Americas segment reported a sales increase of 0.5%, while Europe, Middle East and Africa grew by an impressive 9.4%. And the Asia Pacific region delivered 5.3% growth compared to the prior year period. Our strong results in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region were supported by new market introductions of Persona, the personalized knee system, which continues to gain commercial traction and competitive conversion at a premium price point across the globe. We've also been extremely pleased with the notable overseas performance of our market-leading, clinically proven NexGen knee replacement system.", "In addition, Zimmer continued to leverage our intelligent instrumentation portfolio in the second quarter, including the iASSIST Personalized Guidance System, Patient Specific Instruments and our digital templating solutions. These advanced offerings are designed to enhance intraoperative precision and efficiency, while delivering ongoing economic and operational benefits to orthopedic service lines. Lastly, our early intervention portfolio continued to achieve sales growth and increase adoption, in line with our expectations. The performance of these products, most notably Gel-One and Subchondroplasty, continue to validate our investments into early stage intervention and joint preservation.", "Zimmer's hip business grew sales by 0.4% in the second quarter, reflecting positive volume and mix of 3.4% and negative price of 3.0%. These results include a 1.9% sales decrease in the Americas; a sales decrease of 0.8% in Europe, Middle East and Africa; and an impressive 7.8% sales increase in the Asia Pacific region. Our strong performance in the Asia Pacific region was led by the M/L Taper Hip Prosthesis with Kinectiv Technology, the Continuum Acetabular System and BIOLOX delta Ceramic heads. We believe that the ongoing contribution of these and other premium constructs will create additional growth opportunities in future periods in part by leveraging differentiated technologies such as the Avenir hip system, VIVACIT-E advanced bearing material and the Synovasure biomarker test for periprosthetic joint infection.", "Zimmer's extremities business recorded growth of 5.2% in the second quarter, led by strong performances in the Asia Pacific and Europe, Middle East and Africa regions with 19.4% and 18.0% sales growth, respectively. Despite facing challenging sales comparisons in the United States, as well as competitive product launches which drove some trialing of other systems, extremities continued to benefit from robust sales of our Trabecular Metal Reverse Shoulder System. Together with this leading upper extremity solution, which now includes a Patient Specific Instruments platform, our recent introductions into new anatomical sites are broadening our offerings in this fast-growing category. These exciting products include our Nexel Total Elbow system, featuring VIVACIT-E and the differentiated Trabecular Metal Total Ankle system.", "Zimmer dental sales decreased by 1.4% in the second quarter. We experienced steady demand across our broad dental implant offerings, including the Trabecular Metal Dental Implant, and solid performances from our leading regenerative product lines. Growth of 4% in the Americas was offset by continued softened demand for premium solutions in Europe, which slowed our overall growth this quarter. However, the ongoing introduction of our P-I-branded, value-based offerings across Southern Europe tempered the impact of this market transition.", "Trauma sales rose 6.4% in the second quarter, with our Americas segment reporting a sales decrease of 3.6%; Europe, Middle East and Africa growing sales by 14.9%; and the Asia Pacific region delivering 17.9% growth. Our impressive results overseas were driven by strong performances across all major market segments, led by the Zimmer Natural Nail family, NCB Periprosthetic Plating System and the XtraFix External Fixation System. As we look to future quarters, we'll remain focused on the commercialization of strategic portfolio additions, including the existing launch of the Zimmer Distal Radius Plating System, a versatile trauma system with comprehensive instrumentation designed to conform to a broad range of patient anatomy.", "Zimmer spine sales decreased by 4.4% from the prior year period. This business continues to expand its diversified portfolio, and in the second quarter, bolstered its core fusion offerings with the 510(k) clearances and commercial launches of the Optio-C interior cervical system and the Virage OCT spinal fixation system, both of which have experienced promising early results. Combined with solid performances in key Asia Pacific and European markets, we believe that Zimmer spine is well positioned for growth in the second half of 2014.", "Turning to our surgical and other category. Zimmer posted a sales decline of 9.9% for the quarter. It's worth noting that after normalizing our results to account for the exceptional performance in the capital sales of our differentiated Transposal fluid waste management system in the prior year, our surgical business continued to post solid results. Sales of both the Transposal system and its higher-margin consumables have remained in line with our execution plan. Our overall results were also bolstered by strong sales of the A.T.S. family of automated tourniquet systems, surgical consumable products and surgical power equipment, highlighted by our Universal Power System surgical instruments. As we look to the rest of the year, we'll continue to leverage this differentiated portfolio for improved growth.", "Before I close, I'd like to now make some comments about our planned combination with Biomet. As we communicated in April, this transaction will enhance our position in the $45 billion musculoskeletal industry. It will also allow us to offer a broader, more comprehensive portfolio of musculoskeletal solutions across the continuum of care, with both cross-selling opportunities and a revenue mix that is more diversified and predictable. In the weeks following our April announcement, we finalized important financing details of this $13.35 billion acquisition and met a number of key integration planning milestones to finish the quarter on track and on schedule with the process of closing this transaction. Having worked closely with the leadership of Biomet over the course of the second quarter, we've gained invaluable exposure to their highly talented and committed business teams. This experience has heightened our confidence in the value we'll be able to create and deliver as a combined entity.", "Concerning the ongoing antitrust review of the proposed merger with Biomet, as we announced earlier this month, we received the second request from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. We're in the process of complying with the request and will continue to work closely with the FTC as it conducts its review of the proposed transaction. With regard to the review in Europe, we've been providing requested information to the European Commission and plan to file the merger notification in the near term. We continue to expect the transaction to be clear and remain confident in our anticipated timeline to complete this combination during the first quarter of 2015.", "With that, I'll now ask Jim to provide further details on the second quarter and our updated guidance. Jim?", "James T. Crines", "Thanks, David. I will review our second quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our updated 2014 sales and earnings guidance.", "Our total revenues for the second quarter were $1,183,000,000, a 0.9% constant currency increase compared to the second quarter of 2013. As David noted in his comments, we had approximately 1 less billing day in the quarter on a consolidated basis. Underlying growth rates would be approximately 1% higher on a consolidated basis and nearly 1.5% higher in the Americas. Net currency impact for the quarter increased revenues by 0.2% or $2 million. The positive currency impact for the quarter related principally to our euro-denominated revenues, partially offset by negative currency translation associated with our Japanese yen and Australian dollar base revenues.", "Our adjusted gross profit margin was 72.6% for the quarter. The margin ratio declined 70 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2013. In the second quarter, we recognized approximately 70 basis points of charges related to the medical device excise tax. Increased pressure from price, coupled with the recognition of negative manufacturing variances associated with our quality and operational excellence programs, were partially offset by ongoing benefits from our cash flow hedging program and reduced year-over-year excess and obsolescence charges.", "The company's R&D expense decreased 12.6% or $7 million to 4.1% of net sales when compared to the prior year. The decrease in R&D expense continues to reflect focused efforts on our quality and operational excellence initiatives and related dedication of resources. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $456 million in the second quarter, and at 38.5% of sales, were 70 basis points below the prior year. The improved ratio reflects the ongoing benefits from our operational excellence programs, including, among other things, strategic sourcing of indirect supplies and services, as well as the establishment of shared services, leveraged across multiple reporting units.", "In the quarter, the company reported pretax charges of $64.7 million in special items; $9.6 million in cost of products sold pertaining to global restructuring, quality and operational excellence initiatives and recent acquisitions; and $10 million of interest and financing costs associated with the pending Biomet transaction. Adjusted second quarter 2014 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these charges, which include $55.4 million related to quality and operational excellence, initiatives to manufacturing logistics and sales; and $28.9 million in integration and other costs. Additionally, in the quarter, we increased our provision for certain claims related to the Durom Acetabular Component by $21.8 million before taxes. This reflects an increase in the total estimated viability for projected worldwide claims related to Durom, offset by anticipated insurance recoveries.", "Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to $355.4 million. At 30%, our adjusted operating profit-to-sales ratio was 50 basis points higher than the prior year second quarter. The continued expansion of operating margin reflects our ongoing financial commitment to our stockholders through disciplined execution of our growth and operational excellence, goals and objectives. Net interest expense for the quarter amounted to $12.9 million, which was favorable when compared to the prior year quarter.", "Adjusted net earnings were $254.7 million for the second quarter, an increase of 4.6% compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 4.2% to $1.49 on a 171 million average outstanding diluted shares. These adjusted earnings per share are inclusive of approximately $0.05 of share-based compensation. At $1.03, reported diluted earnings per share increased 15.7% from the prior year second quarter reported EPS of $0.89.", "Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.8%, which is 60 basis points favorable when compared to prior year due to higher mix of earnings from lower tax jurisdictions. Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.5%, as the majority of restructuring and other special items charges are incurred in higher tax jurisdictions. The company had approximately 168.8 million shares of common stock outstanding as of June 30, 2014, an increase over the 167.8 million as of March 31, 2013.", "Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $254.1 million, an increase of 34% from $189.7 million in the second quarter of 2013. The increase is driven primarily by favorable accounts receivable trends in our Europe, Middle East and Africa operating segments and lower tax payments relative to the same period prior year. Net inventories were $1,147,000,000 at the end of the second quarter, an increase of $21.3 million from March 31, 2014. The increase is due primarily to the support of ongoing global commercialization of new product offerings, as well as the effects of going through a direct sales model in certain Eastern European markets.", "Adjusted inventory days on hand finished the quarter at 304 days, an increase of 20 days as compared to the prior year same quarter. As of the end of the second quarter, net receivables increased to $950 million from $943 million in the second quarter of 2013 or 1% over prior year. Our adjusted traded cash receivable days sales outstanding finished the quarter at 69 days, flat when compared with the prior year. Depreciation and amortization expense for the second quarter amounted to $91.3 million.", "Free cash flow in the second quarter was $159.5 million, $51 million higher than the second quarter of 2013. We define free cash flow as operating cash flow less cash outlays for instruments and property, plant and equipment. The significant increase in free cash flow was driven by increased operating cash flows, while still supporting the ongoing launch of new products through rolling instrument deployments. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $94.6 million, including $62.6 million for instruments and $32 million for property, plant and equipment.", "I'd like to turn now to our guidance for 2014. In our earnings release this morning, we updated the company's expectation for full year 2014 revenues and now forecast revenues to increase between 2% and 3% constant currency when compared to 2013. We continue to expect foreign currency translation to decrease our reported 2014 revenues by approximately 0.5% for the full year. Therefore, on a reported basis, our revenues are projected to be between 1.5% and 2.5% above 2013 results. For the third quarter, we expect revenues to increase between 2% and 2.5% constant currency and between 2.5% and 3% on a reported basis when compared to the prior year. We expect to recognize gains on hedge contracts in the second half and continue to see positive comparisons related to inventory obsolescence charges and manufacturing variances.", "Consequently, our guidance for the gross margin ratio for the year remains unchanged and is expected to be between 73% and 74%. Our guidance for R&D, SG&A and interest expense for the full year remains unchanged. However, as you refine your models for the third and fourth quarters, please consider that seasonally higher ratios typically experienced in the third quarter. We expect our SG&A ratio in the third quarter to be in a range of 40.5% to 41%, while R&D expenses as a percentage of sales is likely to be at or near 4.5% for the quarter.", "Moving down the income statement, the estimated full year tax rate remains at 25.5%. The previously guided fully diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares is now expected to be in a range of 172 million to 173 million shares, due to higher expected employee stock option exercises. Full year 2014 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance has been updated to be within a range of $6 to $6.10, taking into account our updated expectations for full year revenue growth, as well as a slight increase in the fully diluted share count.", "As indicated in our earnings release, to arrive at our anticipated reported GAAP earnings per share, you should subtract total charges for special items and certain claims of $250 million and $70 million of Biomet transaction-related expenses on a pretax basis or approximately $1.35 per share. Taking into account the seasonality associated with the third quarter and other factors, third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be in a range of $1.29 to $1.31. Finally, please note that our guidance does not include any impact from any unforeseen events.", "David, I'll turn the call back over to you.", "David C. Dvorak", "Thanks, Jim. In the second quarter, Zimmer achieved solid sales across a number of product categories and geographic regions that are vital to our growth plan. We're also able to return significant value to our stockholders by successfully executing on the ongoing commercialization of new clinically relevant product offerings, realizing the benefits of our operational excellence agenda and demonstrating prudent stewardship for capital.", "As I mentioned earlier, we're very excited about our planned combination with Biomet. By leveraging the best of both companies, our combined entity will possess an organizational talent advantage that will distinguish us in our industry. Our vision for this combination is to enhance our position as a leading musculoskeletal innovator, identifying new growth opportunities through a number of attractive portfolio additions and shaping future solutions for the evolving healthcare industry.", "And now I'd like to ask Regina to begin the Q&A portion of our call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I just wanted to ask 1 on the deal here. So first of all, can you update us as to whether there's been any change in your views of the net synergies or where they may be coming from with regards to the transaction? And then also, wanted to ask if you could provide any more color on what these subsequent requests have been about and why you're still confident in the timing?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, on the first part, Matt, there hasn't been a change in the view of our net synergies. We're developing the detailed plans, and we're very confident in what we expressed at the point of the initial announcement of the combination. With respect to the regulatory process as well, the analysis that was the basis for our decision to move forward remains very much in line with what we're experiencing. We see this as being an aspect of the process that is absolutely manageable. We're confident that we're going to get the transaction cleared and look to consummate the combination in the first quarter of 2015. So everything on both fronts is tracking very consistent with the analysis that led to the execution and announcement of the deal in the first instance.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And then you called out pricing in your comments certainly in line with the guidance for the year, but towards the higher end. I guess, number one, why did you feel like you needed to explicitly call that out? And are there any other areas of weakness or strength over the next several periods that you would note from a pricing or mix perspective that could change that dynamic?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, I think that the dynamics have been pretty consistent. As we've said, we're very transparent and provide a fair amount of granularity on the pricing every quarter, Matt. And as we said, the sequential decline from about 2.3% to 2.8% in our case was principally driven by the biannual adjustment that was anticipated in Japan that came in within a range of what was expected. So we're right about at the midpoint of what we guided to back in January. Our expectation was for the full year on price, which was a range of minus 2% to minus 3%. And I think that probably in the short term, commercial execution of new product launches and taking advantage of the mix opportunities are the area for us to focus on to offset some of the price pressure. But again, the price pressure has been pretty consistent.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of William Plovanic with Canaccord Genuity.", "William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Just on the acquisition, one thing I'd like to ask is how were you thinking about the peripheral businesses and the disruptions in those channels? As we look at what's going on in knees and hips, you said you'll keep that distribution in place, but how should we think about the peripheral businesses?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, we're going to put plans together that are directed and focused on unique aspects of each of those businesses. It's the case as we've had discussions with people that some of the fear around the distribution channel, I think, is more premised upon what one has seen through combinations outside of the large joints side. And so we need to learn from those lessons, both ones that we'd experienced in the past, as well as ones that others have experienced. I think the historic track record on the large joints side is quite good on combining the distribution channels and retaining the momentum of the businesses. So we're going to look at developing these plans unique for each of those business units, and we'll take a bit different approach as necessary and as is consistent with our longer-term vision as to how we want those channels to be structured to make sure that we're growing at or above market in each product category in each of the geographic segments.", "William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Okay. And then just on the trends in the business in general. We've seen you're the fourth player to report thus far. It seems like Q1 was slow. It was weather and maybe back-end loading due to ACA. As Q2 rolls out, it looks like it's not coming back to the length that we had thought it would. Do you think there's a different type of seasonality in the market today? Do you think the market maybe is slowing a bit? How should we think about this?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, I don't think that the market is slowing. I think that the market is in a range of something that should properly be characterized as stable, certainly across the global markets, that's the case. Within the United States, which has obviously been the area of a lot of focus coming out of the fourth quarter 2013 with the uptick that we saw, I do think that you're going to see some shift in seasonality. We clearly saw that as far as a percentage of revenues for the total year that were generated in Q4. That was a bit of an outlier. And I do think that you're going to see some of that shift be retained in 2014. It's a bit of a question as to how much or whether or not that trend will even continue further, but it was something that we saw in the fourth quarter. As you look at the sequential patterns from Q1 to Q2 in 2014, they're actually pretty consistent with historic trends. So again, on a global basis, this is a stable market. And I think that as we get into the second half, we'll all gain insight as to how much of that seasonality shift is permanent, whether or not that's going to continue as an expanded trend.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So first question is really on the performance in the quarter and then a little bit on the guidance. So I'd love to ask you to comment on a couple things. One, just broadly, why are you lowering the revenue guidance? What's going on in the business that was different than you thought 30 days ago? And also, Jim, if you could comment on why gross margins were weak this quarter relative -- especially relative to Q1. I'm just trying to understand that a little bit better. And then, finally, to get it all in, in one thing, on the selling day issue, not to nitpick, but last quarter, you said you had an extra half day, now it's an extra full day. I just wanted to kind of reconcile that.", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes. On the last of those, I think we said we had an extra half day in the first quarter. What we said in Q2, Bob, was that we had 1 less billing day, okay. So with respect to the guidance, a lot of that is just math relative to where we've been for the first half of the year. We came in with the midpoint of 4%. We're now revising to 2.5%. A lot of that is just the reality of the U.S. performance in Q2 and the consolidated results in Q2 and what it would take to do performance-wise in the second half of the year to push up towards that midpoint of 4%. So we're guiding at 2% to 3%. And if one does the math, there's obviously some sequential improvement in growth rates that is embedded in the potential for that guidance for the second half of the year. But it's another quarter of insight. Some of that is market, but I think we've got some work to do, frankly, in the United States to fully exploit the opportunities that we have with the new product introductions. In the second quarter, we did a better job of exploiting those opportunities outside the United States as is evidenced by, for instance, the strong performance in knees within the Europe, Middle East and Africa geographic segments and the strong performance in hips within the Asia Pacific region. So the portfolio is there, and we're going to redouble our efforts to focus on taking advantage of what the market gives us in the United States in the second half of the year and hope that we generate some positive trends in our performance sequentially into Q3 and Q4. You want to grab the margin question?", "James T. Crines", "Sure. Bob, this is Jim. Just on the gross margin question, we guided coming into the year a gross margin ratio at 73% to 74%. We're still guiding to that same range. So we had good visibility coming into the year as to what the opportunity would be on gross margin and, frankly, still have good visibility to how we're going to achieve that. In the second half, as I indicated, the lower anticipated manufacturing variance is really the principal difference in getting from kind of where we are in the second quarter to where we expect to be in the second half of the year. There's also some differences, some favorability and hedge gains second half relative to the first half. But I would tell you, the more significant contributor to the difference in gross margin ratios between both the first and second quarters, as well as the step-up from second quarter into the second half, have to do with manufacturing variances. And those are largely connected with the operational and quality excellence initiatives that we have underway. Those variances -- negative variances were largely incurred in the second half of last year, that's why we had good visibility as to how they were going to impact on this year. Those are largely amortized off now through the first half of the year. And we have visibility now to the actual variances that were incurred in the first half that will impact on the second half and why we feel confident in the step-up we're anticipating in the second half of the year relative to the second quarter.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And then on the Americas business, is that a little early Biomet disruption, you think? Or is there something else going on?", "David C. Dvorak", "I don't at all believe that. If you look at the announcement date, we announced the transaction and our entering the agreement for the transaction on the 24th of April. And so you essentially had 2 months. And we're just not seeing signs of that, Bob. I think that this is for us to improve our performance relative to the opportunity we have with the product bag and the new product introductions. And so, as I said, big area of focus for us in the second half of the year.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Question. Just a follow-up on the performance in Americas. Is the launch of the Persona knee -- I know there were higher expectations for that or relatively high expectations for that going to the year, and that was going to be a big growth driver. Is that one of the areas that you're looking to improve upon or maybe the one area that isn't quite meeting your expectations versus what you thought about going into the year? And then last -- on the call last quarter, you talked about your expectations that the combined Zimmer-Biomet organization would be able to grow sort of revenues at market post integration, including kind of any sort of revenue dis-synergies. Is that still your view, given kind of your new outlook on your business? Or has that changed also?", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure, Derrick. The launch of Persona continues to be a success story for us. We've got some other categories in some of the legacy knee business that we need to improve our performance upon, but we're tracking in a consistent manner with expectations on the capability to take that system into competitive accounts and not only get trialing but convert business. So the promise of Persona is unchanged relative to the prior conversations and discussions we've had. And as far as the go-forward view as to -- on a combined basis, we absolutely believe that we're going to be able to, in the initial stages, grow the combined business at market. And obviously, as we complete the integration post-closing in the quarters, an operating period or 2 thereafter, we would expect to accelerate above market growth rates within the musculoskeletal industry.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And on the deal, now that you've had a chance to look more deeply kind of into the financial aspects of it, et cetera, are there any tax opportunities that maybe you didn't call out on -- when you announced the deal that might be available? I'm thinking in terms of perhaps intercompany loans or any sort of rationalization or optimization of the manufacturing footprint that might leave any tax opportunities in the integrated business?", "James T. Crines", "Derrick, this is Jim. I think it's fair to assume that we have teams that are very focused and working with outside subject matter experts kind of helping us identify where those opportunities are to either drive a lower effective tax rate for the combined entity going forward and/or just as importantly, determine how we might be able to get access to the cash that's going to be accumulating offshore connected with the businesses overseas and the revenues and profits that are being generated overseas. And so there's a real focus on it, a dedicated effort. Smart people with a lot of expertise that are going to continue to work the issues and determine how we can optimize both the effective tax rate, as well as our -- the opportunity to access the cash flow that's going to be -- or the cash that's going to be accumulating offshore. But beyond that, I'm not -- we're not at a stage where we could provide any more specific guidance.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And if I could just slip one quick one in. Could you give us a sense for the contribution of Gel-One this quarter in the early intervention portfolio? You mentioned it was kind of tracking few expectations. I think a couple quarters ago, we were kind of in that $5 million to $10 million range. And maybe give us a sense for where we are with that launch.", "James T. Crines", "Yes, we continue to pick up share with that product really, frankly, very pleased with the progress that we're making. There's more opportunity in front of us, and that team is focused on taking full advantage of those opportunities to get that product listed on formularies where it's not currently listed on formularies, just as 1 example. I don't want to and we don't want to get into providing brand sales information on these calls. We have hundreds of brands, Derrick. So I know as much as you're interested in for the tracking how that particular one is doing, I'm not going to provide any more specific information than that.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Richard Newitter with Leerink Capital.", "Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "I was just hoping just going back to the lowered top line guidance, David, if you could maybe talk a little bit about how much -- I appreciate maybe you're revising it to see what happened, play out in the second quarter. But how much of the step-down can you attribute specifically to kind of a change in your view of the pricing kind of environment and what you saw in 2Q in the first half versus kind of volumes? Can you maybe parse that out a little bit?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, I wouldn't say that any significant portion of it is based upon a revised view of pricing. Again, if you go back to the January call, we provided some specific visibility to what we're anticipating for the year, and that was a range of negative 2% to negative 3%. We're bang on in the middle of that halfway through the year. So that really doesn't impact our go-forward view. So you pull that out to volume and mix, and both of those are highly related to our commercial execution. And coming out of Q2 here that we're going to focus on, obviously, for improvement in the United States commercial execution.", "Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just kind of adding onto an earlier question that was asked. With respect to kind of the longer-term outlook post the Biomet deal, assuming it goes through on time, as you think it will, the question I have is does the -- perhaps a slightly lowered growth rate for some of your core recon businesses heading into that transaction impact what you think the kind of top line dis-synergy impact could be and how that impacts the potential for the cost synergies to offset that and lead to your net synergy number? Or is all of that fully intact and you feel confident that you can regain through execution whatever, perhaps, you didn't do as well as you wanted to do in 2Q?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, we're confident. We're confident. We've got all the necessary ingredients, talent in the field, the right product offerings, a whole variety of terrific new products and innovative solutions that either are launched or are in the process of being launched. So we're going to be in good shape as we consummate the combination and move forward. And I think that the other side, on the Biomet side, they're doing good work and continuing their strong momentum. So our goal is, obviously, independent of one another, to maintain the momentum so that we hit that start line and -- with good boat's feet. And I think that I'm very confident at this point that we're going to be able to achieve that objective and then take it forward from there.", "Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "And just one last one, on the competitive trialing that you called out in the shoulder arena, can you just describe kind of what you're hearing? And is this -- are they generally coming back to you? Or what's the feedback then? Do you feel confident that that's transient?", "David C. Dvorak", "Well, I think that there are just a lot of new systems and the number of players within that space has broadened in a pretty significant way over the course of the last operating period or 2. So we've enjoyed a nice position historically within that market. And we have some important new innovations, including the PSI offering for upper extremities. We continue to drive nice gains and growth with our Trabecular Metal Reverse Shoulder. And suffice it to say that we have some other things in the pipeline that are going to help us ensure that the trialing doesn't become a permanent conversion in the go-forward quarters, okay.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I wanted to follow up a couple of items. First, I want to follow up Bob's question just on the gross margins. Jim, you talked about the benefit of your hedging program. It showed up a little bit this quarter. It sounds like it'll be there in the back half of the year. Could you quantify what impact that will have in the back half of the year? And then as those hedges roll over, does that become a headwind for 2015? How should we think about that?", "James T. Crines", "I guess if you look at the year-to-year comparisons, Mike, it's a modest improvement year-to-year. But in absolute terms, it's probably somewhere in the range of 40 -- short of 40 basis points in terms of contribution in each of those quarters, in Q3 and Q4. And yes, going into next year, and we know, with the hedging program, what it does is provides protection for an operating period or sometimes a little more than an operating period. And we have that much time to get whatever sort of things we need to get in place, whether it's adjustments in pricing or reductions in standard costs to offset whatever decline we might otherwise see in gross margins as a consequence of currency changes. So it's only a headwind to the extent that we don't offset it with cost savings and/or price changes. And then as I pointed out to Bob, you understand as well, I think everybody understands, the headwind associated with the medical device tax in this year's numbers, which will not have, obviously, going into next year because it'll be fully -- obviously, fully reflected in the margin as we get through the end of this year.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Let me shift gears, and I know you mentioned some of this earlier, but I just want to understand the strategy around distribution, particularly in U.S., the 2 U.S. recon sales force. So it sounds like, David, the plan for now is to try and keep everybody in place for some period of time post-closing. Can you just help us understand, one, the cost of a program like that? I know we've seen it in other companies. So how much will you invest in order to retain distribution for some period of time? And then two, how long do you think that period of time is? Is there a point which, is it year 2 in which we would expect to see greater integration of the U.S. distribution system?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, I think I would tell you that from a starting point, we've made the statements and commitments to retain all of the sales positions for both entities. And that's really important because from our perspective, we're going to have a broader set of solutions and offerings in order to fully leverage the cross-selling opportunities that come with this combination. We're going to need all of that sales talent, and there's a pretty extraordinary level of sales talent in both sides of these organizations. So the design of that distribution channel, all of that work is in process at this point in time, with the leadership teams having been established. And in the coming weeks, months, they're going to continue to make good progress on that front, but it's premised upon retaining the sales positions and fully leveraging all of the products and solutions the combined entity will possess. So that is the fundamental value creator from the company's perspective on a combined basis. It's also the primary value creator from the customers' standpoint, and will align the sales folks' opportunity to do really well economically in accordance with achieving the objective and realizing the full potential.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So I'm sorry, but coming back to the question, do you know what the cost will be of retention? So you're going to put a retention program in place. Do you have at this point an estimate what that cost would be? Is that something that is in the P&L? Or is that something that is outside the P&L, Jim?", "James T. Crines", "Yes, Mike, this is Jim. As we indicated when we made the announcement, we anticipate spending somewhere in the range -- somewhere in the order of $400 million on costs to integrate. So that would -- within it, would be an estimate of what we expect to spend on both retention and integration. And it would be separated out, if you will, excluded to arrive at our cash earnings measure.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.", "Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I just wanted to come back to the assumption for the Biomet deal. So how should we think about the accretion from the Biomet deal in the first year? Is it still the $1.15 to $1.25? And how should we think about the base EPS that's offered for 2015? The midpoint of your EPS guidance for this year is about 5%. So how should we think about kind of the underlying EPS growth for '15? And then I have a follow-up.", "James T. Crines", "No change in the expectations with respect to year 1 accretion, so still in a range of $1.15 to $1.25. As you pointed out, midpoint of our guidance for 2014 EPS on an adjusted basis is $6.05. And we haven't, at this stage, obviously, given guidance for 2015 EPS for Zimmer on a standalone basis. So you'll have to make whatever assumptions you feel sort of appropriate with respect to what kind of growth. We're going to continue to run the business, and we would certainly continue to run the business the way we have been over the past number of years, driving leverage, earnings growth off of the top line opportunity that still view to be somewhere in the range of low to mid-single digits. So that hopefully provides you with at least a little bit of direction on how to think about the expectation that we have for the combined entity for 2015.", "Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "That's very helpful. And I just wanted to come back to pricing. If we take a step back and we look at the pricing trends for you and your competitors in hips and knees over the past few years, it looks like there has been a degradation in pricing from about 2% in 2011, 2.5% in 2012 and '13, and about 3% or so this -- thus far in '14. Is that a fair assessment of the pricing environment? And can you -- Jim, in the past, you've talked about kind of pricing pressure going forward and this kind of reversion to the mean, if you will. Where are we in that process? And what can you tell us to give us confidence that we won't see further degradation, let's say, over the next year or so?", "James T. Crines", "Sure. Well, as we've talked about over the past couple of operating periods, we continue to experience some pressure, particularly at the high end of our price curves. And particularly in the U.S. market, which has traditionally, just in terms of healthcare service providers, has been a somewhat fragmented market. It's becoming a lot less fragmented, obviously, with hospitals consolidating, large integrated networks coming together and doing their purchasing across those entire networks. That will continue, but we have been able to provide very clear guidance on what our expectations are. That guidance really hasn't changed. It's been typically in that range of around minus 2%, minus 3%. We do know, with respect to the consolidated sort of outlook and we'll again provide some guidance when we get to that point with respect to 2015. But at least in 2015, we will again anniversary out of the Japan biennial price cuts. So that'll provide at least a bit of a tailwind as we get into the back half of 2015. It's hard to say sort of exactly when we would expect to see those pricing trends, particularly within the U.S. market, begin to stabilize. But the strategies that we're developing and the tactics that'll be deployed within the U.S. market will certainly be directed at bringing more stability, if you will, particularly as we provide concessions to account at the higher end of the curve.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.", "Jonathan Demchick - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "This is actually Jon Demchick for David. I know it's been covered a bit on the call, but I wanted to try and jive some of the comments about seasonality and then also sales guidance. I mean, it sounded like you guys weren't expecting a change in the seasonal trends, which push sales higher in the back half. But it looks as though when you adjust for the day, growth is expected to be organically stable in the back half relative to the first half. Are there any specific headwinds that you expect in the second half offsetting the increased seasonality that we typically expect? I mean, it sounded like pricing wasn't necessarily the culprit here.", "David C. Dvorak", "No, there aren't. I think that the toughest thing to predict is off of last year's uptick, how much of that seasonality shift that we saw last year will become baked into 2014 and future periods and as a consequence, a permanent seasonality shift as opposed to more of a onetime acceleration in Q4 from 2013.", "Jonathan Demchick - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Very helpful. On the Biomet transaction, just had a couple quick questions. Was there any timing of expectations on complying with the second request? And then also, what was going into the $70 million of additional expenses related to Biomet? I mean, is that just financing? Or is there anything else there?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, everything that we've had by way of experience on the regulatory submission process and ultimately path towards clearance is very consistent with the due diligence that we conducted leading up to the announcement of the transaction. So nothing at all out of line with expectations, and the work streams are moving forward and the teams on both sides are being very responsive to the request. So we, again, would just express confidence that the transaction will be cleared and that from a timing standpoint, the expectation continues to be the first quarter of 2015.", "James T. Crines", "Yes, and just with respect to the $70 million, the majority of that is related to the financing, which covers, at this stage, both the bridge financing, as well as the bank syndication, which is done in the credit facility. As well, there's some significant fees associated with the integration planning process, which is underway, legal fees associated with the application process here in the U.S. and in Europe, as well as some financial advisory fees associated with the process we'll go through to begin to value the entity that we're acquiring. So that covers what's included in the $70 million.", "Operator", "Our final question will come from the line of Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "So one on just the tone and the growth that you saw in the quarter, maybe for David. Appreciate the color on the stability of the market. You mentioned you have -- I thought you said you had some work to do in the U.S. to kind of exploit the Persona launch maybe more effectively. If the market's improving sequentially here in Q2, what is it you think that created the challenge in the U.S.? And what kind of things can you do to sort of reinvigorate the growth behind that launch here in the second half? And then I have a follow-up.", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, I think that what I was expressing is that the Persona launch continues on track, Matt, and consistent with our expectations. I, in response to one of the prior questions, was referencing the fact that the legacy business needs to be strengthened and our support for that business. So some of that is probably, naturally, a high level of focus and energy on the Persona launch executing well on that front and needing to ensure that at the same time, we're taking advantage of the opportunities that we have in other product categories, as well as providing a high level of attention and focus on the legacy business, including the NexGen business, importantly within the knee category. So it's blocking and tackling on the commercial execution side that is going to lead to the improvement that we look to drive in the second half of the fiscal year. And I don't think that there's anything related to the deal announcement of significance, and I don't think that there's any big unknown in relation to that. So I think we know what we need to do.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "So we look at these big knee system launches like Persona, it's like a 3-year, maybe a 4-year product cycle to fully kind of roll it out and execute it, and this is year 2. And just from what you're saying, it sounds like there's nothing in particular that's different about what you needed to do this year than last year. Is that fair? Is this just continued execution?", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, I think that, that's right. And I think that if you look at our performance sequentially last year, it improved as the year progressed. I think that in the rhythm of the operating period, there's a little bit of a bolus of activity on the front end of the year to get the compensation plans and instrument set deployments launched that are part of the operating plan year. We've done that. We would expect to get those turns up and to start retrieve some of the benefits from those first quarter and second quarter activities and hopefully get on a track that looks a lot like the sequential improvement that we saw in the second half of 2013 within the United States. I mean, there's no doubt that we continue to track fine relative to the market, above market performance on a global basis in the knee category and likely a bit above market performance in the United States as well.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "And then the follow-up on the deal, the Biomet deal. I just wanted to push you a little bit on, I know that you are confident in the messaging that you're sending down to distribution. But I guess I know that this did not factor into your comments on guidance, the change in guidance. But should we not expect some distraction? Should we not expect some -- given that these are, in many cases, third-party distribution, so help me understand a little bit about how we should be thinking about the pace of the business or -- heading into that acquisition.", "David C. Dvorak", "Yes, I think there are always going to be dynamics that relate to the alignment in management across the different aspects of the business, Matt. And whether it's a distraction because of a big launch in a large joint category on one side or the other, or some other dynamic taking place, whether it's an internal organizational matter or something more significant like this combination. But look, winners are going to react as winners do. They're going to step up and perform in those circumstances, and we're going to see that prevail. We're going to see people that believe in the promise of this combination and the capability not only to cross-sell upon the day of closing, but the broader promise of being able to innovate in a truly differentiated way because of what this combination brings and want to be part of that. And I am absolutely confident that at the rep level and the territory leader level, we're going to put together a team of talent that is going to be unmatched in the industry. And whether or not there's some bump and grind along the way to getting there, one would expect that there would be some of that, but that's our responsibility to manage it. And again, the closer I get to the talent, I know our group and learn more about the Biomet group, I'm absolutely convinced that the capability resides within that channel. And we're going to act in a manner that's consistent with the articulation of the promise of this combination and the manner to bring that out. So we're very confident, Matt, that we're going to land in a good place.", "So with that, I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today and for your continued interest and support. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter conference call, which is scheduled for 8 a.m. on October 23.

Mr. Marshall, you may begin your call.", "Bob Marshall", "Thank you, Julie and good morning and welcome to Zimmer's Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. I'm here with our CEO, David Dvorak and our CFO, Jim Crines.", "Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties. Also, the discussions during this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call for the fourth quarter of 2014. This morning, I'll review our fourth quarter financial results, providing commentary on 2014 and highlights from our performance. Jim will then provide additional financial details. I'll state all sales in constant currency terms and all earnings results on an adjusted basis.", "In the fourth quarter and throughout 2014 Zimmer delivered solid sales growth across several key product categories as well as in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region and the Asia Pacific region. ", "Consolidated net sales for the quarter were $1.22 billion, an increase of 2.4% and our earnings per share were $1.71, an increase of 3% over the prior year period. Full year sales for 2014 were $4.67 billion, an increase of 2.4% over 2013 and our earnings per share were $6.06, an increase of 5.4%.", "Turning to each of our geographic regions, in the fourth quarter our Europe, Middle East and Africa business increased sales by 6.9% over the prior year and our Asia Pacific business delivered impressive 8.4% growth. Our sales decreased by 1.6% in the Americas on challenging comparisons in the prior year period, both largely to the exceptional market growth rate experienced in U.S. procedural volumes in 2013 attributable to factors related to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.", "Before reviewing the performances of each of our product categories, I\u2019d like to first comment on market conditions. We saw global musculoskeletal markets demonstrates stability in the fourth quarter despite soft and macro economic conditions in certain geographies supporting our confidence for 2015 and beyond. While increased procedural demand in the fourth quarter of 2013 resulted in challenging sales comparisons in the Americas, we believe that the steady performance of this market over the last two years signals a stable demand for musculoskeletal solution including premium technologies.", "With respect to pricing, we experienced price pressure of negative 2.4% both in the quarter and for the full year consistent with our expectations. Against this backdrop, Zimmer\u2019s market leading knee business increased sales by 2.5% in the fourth quarter, an overall steady performance reflecting positive volume and mix of 5.6% and negative price of 3.1%.", "The Europe, Middle East and Africa region delivered 6.1% growth, the Asia Pacific region increased sales by 6.2% and America sales were flat against prior year growth of 10.7%. Throughout the fourth quarter, focussed execution expanded the ongoing growth of our knee business in key overseas geographies while supporting the stable domestic performance.

Sales increased by 3.7% and the Europe, Middle East and Africa region increased by 6.2% in the Asia Pacific region and decreased by 4% in the Americas. As in previous quarters our performance was led by growing sales for premiums solutions such as the Continuum Acetabular System, BIOLOX delta heads and product offerings leveraging Vivacit-E, our advanced Vitamin E infused bearing material.", "In 2014, our hip business also made important progress with respect to innovations that we believe offer compelling value to the evolving healthcare market. By way of example, in 2014 Vivacit-E hip liners completed more than 90 million cycles of laboratory ware testing without oxidation or strength reduction making Vivacit-E the only hip replacement technology laboratory tested to mimic the number of walking steps and long term in Vivo environment a patient will typically experience during their life time following hip replacement.", "Results such as these have supported Vivacit-E commercial growth as well as its acceptance in the clinical and payer communities reinforcing our confidence in this platform technology.

The negative currency impact for the quarter related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against many international currencies which I will address in more detail in my guidance comments.", "Our adjusted gross profit margin was 74.4% for the quarter, an 80 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2013. During the fourth quarter, we anniversary through charges related to the medical device excise tax. Together with lower inventory obsolescence and gains from our currency hedges, these improvements were modestly offset by manufacturing variances and negative price ", "The company's R&D expense was flat when compared to the prior year. Zimmer remains committed to producing a pipeline of new and innovative products that will meet the needs of stakeholders and the evolving healthcare environment and help drive growth in future operating periods.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses were $459 million in the fourth quarter and at 37.5% of sales, were 90 basis points below the prior year. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 39% for the full year an improvement of 70 basis points.

The first quarter will reflect up to five additional billing days for those units which has the effect of adding an estimated 3% to our consolidated revenues for the quarter.", "Therefore on a constant currency basis with the additional billing days, we expect first quarter revenues to grow between 4.5% and 5.5%. On a reported basis taking into account the effective foreign currency translation, our revenues are projected to be between 1.5% and 0.5% below the prior year.", "I\u2019d like to make the few additional remarks regarding the significant currency headwind we are facing as a result of recent move in currency rate in relation to the U.S. dollar. As we described in detail in our periodic filings we managed currency risk with derivative financial instruments, which has the effect of reducing potential volatility and the dollar value of cash flows.", "Over time our hedging program which has been in place and just spin off in 2001 has been refined and enhanced to include cost averaging, extended durations and emerging market currencies.", "And from a management perspective has been effective in reducing short term volatility and cash flows. While our program is effective in reducing volatility and cash flow, anticipated teams on hedge contract will release the earnings over the course of 2015 will also offset in part the impact of recent currency moves on earnings.", "As a consequence management expect to maintain necessary ongoing strategic investments of product development in sales and marketing. The anticipated reduction of volatility in the short term that would otherwise has impacted our expectations for 2015 will give us time to folks in other operating leverage that will drive sustained, long term growth in top and bottom line.", "Returning to guidance specific to the first quarter, we expect pricing to be minus 2% and minus 3% when compared with the first quarter of 2014. As you move down the income statement assuming currency remain at recent levels, we expect our gross margin ratio to be between 73.5% and 74%.", "This takes into account anticipated gains on foreign currency hedges principally from the Euro and Japanese Yen. We expect R&D expense for the quarter to be approximately 4% to 4.5% of sales, SG&A is expected to between 38.5% and 39% of sales for the quarter as we continue realize efficiencies from our global operational excellence initiatives to further level revenue growth assuming variable rates remained at recent level.", "We expect interest and other expense of around $14 million, similar to the net expense realized to our each quarter of 2014. We anticipated an adjusted effective tax rate to be between 26% and 26.5%, which is above our final full year rate for 2014.", "The increase is mainly attributable to the anticipated change in the mix of our global earnings and profit. We would anticipate that diluted weighted average share outstanding for the first quarter to be between 173 million and 173.5 million shares.", "You will note that our share repurchase program remains on hold pending the Biomet merger. In preparation for our pending merger with Biomet we are moving to an adjusted cash earnings per metric.", "We will add back amortization to our existing adjusted EPS in the first quarter of 2015. We expect amortization during this first quarter to be $24 million or approximately $0.10 per share after tax.", "Therefore 2015 first quarter adjusted diluted earnings share are projected to be in the range of $1.58 to $1.60. As indicated in our release we expected to report pre-tax charges of approximately $107 million within the first quarter of 2015 operating period pertaining to amortization, global restructuring, quality and operational excellence initiatives, interest and other expenses related to the Biomet transaction and other recent acquisitions.", "Therefore to arrive at our anticipated reported GAAP earnings per share you should subtract these charges of approximately $0.46 per share on an after tax basis.", "I would now like to provide an updated accretion and adjusted cash earnings per share in the first 12 months following the close of the Biomet merger. First of all, we remained confident in our previously disclosed net operating earnings synergy target of $270 million by year three.", "With the $135 million achieved within the first 12 months, we would expect that the chasing of these targeted net synergies to favor the back half of the first 12 months due to a structured transition planning that avoiding our necessary disruption.", "In addition after taking into account the effect of recent currency rate movements on the anticipated acquired earnings of Biomet as well as the favorable impact of now lower expected interest rates and acquisition related debt, we expect the accretion from the Biomet pending merger transactions have contribute $1.05 to $1.15 in the first full year following the close of the transaction. The previous range was from $1.15 to $1.25. We will provide more detailed guidance for the combined company after the closing of the merger with Biomet.", "Finally please note that our guidance does not include any impact from other potential business development transactions from unforeseen.", "David, I'll turn the call back over to you.", "David Dvorak", "Thanks, Jim. Throughout 2014 Zimmer delivered on our commitment to drive growth through the focused commercial execution of a comprehensive and innovative portfolio of solutions for the evolving healthcare market.", "Our broad-based approach to product design and business innovation has positioned Zimmer to act on a transformational opportunity to enhanced our global scale by combining with Biomet.", "By bringing together two highly complementary companies in the muscular scale of space we\u2019ll accelerate our shared vision of leading the industry by delivering exceptional value to healthcare providers, their patients and to our stockholders.", "And now, I\u2019d like Julie to begin the Q&A portion of our call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Mike Weinstein. Please go ahead.", "Mike Weinstein", "Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you for taking the questions. I want to just try and dig into the FX commentary Jim just a little bit, the part where you talked about the net impact of FX were Biomet not hedged versus the reduced borrowing cost is very clear, I understand the $0.10 swing there but the commentary on Zimmer pre-Biomet was a bit confusing.", "So can you maybe just talk a bit about the impact of FX on Zimmer pre-Biomet in 2015 as we think about our models? And then in the context of that answer, can you talk a little about the FX hedging program because I'm aware that you had these long dated hedges. I just want to get a better sense of when they roll off and what impact that has not only on 2015 but on 2016? Thanks.", "David Dvorak", "Sure. Maybe to frame it out a little more clearly, Mike. On a standalone basis for the full year, we\u2019ll be expecting for Zimmer to somewhere in the range say $6.20 to $6.30 and adjusted earnings per share, that\u2019s using our prior metric; you would add another $0.40 to that for the adjustments to get to the cash earnings major.", "And then if you add the $1.05 to $1.15 of accretion that we\u2019ve provided yet assuming the transaction that close at beginning of the year, we\u2019d be looking at for the combined enterprise at a range of 755 to 775, and as indicated that takes into account the headwind associated with currency not only on the acquired earnings of Biomet but also on Zimmer standalone earnings.", "And just to be specific about that headwind. With respect to the acquired earnings of Biomet its about $0.30 of headwind, but that\u2019s going to be offset by about $0.20 of savings in interest on the acquisition related debt.", "With respect to Zimmer standalone earnings, yes, may there\u2019s about $0.20 of headwind and that\u2019s net of hedge gains that will be release earnings in 2015. And then as far as the hedging programs goes, as I indicated in my comment we with the refinements we made in that program over time, those hedges extend that as far as 24 months or more.", "As we described in the past the focus of that program is to hedge cash flows associated with intercompany transaction which turns as proxy but not necessarily a perfect proxy for the operating earnings connected with international operating unit. And the other thing to understand is we never fully hedge so the $0.20 that I reference with respect to the Zimmer standalone earnings as I said is net of hedge gains and if not for the hedging program would be frankly a multiple of that number.", "Mike Weinstein", "Jim that\u2019s incredibly helpful. I really appreciated. So only just follow-up there, so the Zimmer standalone you said 6.20 to 6.30 and that\u2019s before-- that\u2019s on GAAP basis the cash would be 6.60 to 6.70 on a standalone and then the $1.05 to $1.15 that\u2019s first 12 months and obviously did you like some close yet. Do you want the street to have that full $1.05 to $1.15 that\u2019s got to the $7.55 to $7.75 in the 2015 modelling assuming the closing ledger this quarter right on January 1?", "Jim Crines", "That\u2019s an excellent point Mike. As I said, you know, providing this \u2013 the guidance that I provided assumes that closing at the first of the year and that\u2019s obviously not the case and for modelling purpose people need to be careful about what they including calendar 2015, because just as you pointed out, the accretion guidance is for the first 12 months following the closing of the transaction and again as I indicated in my remarks the other thing have to be thoughtful of it the fact that that accretion is going to favor the back half of the first 12 months following the close of the transaction just given the time that it takes to take the actions that are necessary to drive those synergies.", "Mike Weinstein", "Okay. So just to make sure the contacts \u2013 the way to look at it is more prorated and obviously back half loaded for the $1.15 to $1.25 still unacceptable that $1.05 to $1.15 \u2013 don\u2019t expect the full $1.05 to $1.15 obviously to flow through in 2015 that maybe the last three quarters of 2015 and the first quarter 2016 lane?", "Jim Crines", "That\u2019s right.", "Mike Weinstein", "Okay. Perfect. Thanks. I'll drop and let others jump in.", "Operator", "Thank you the next question comes from [Indiscernible] from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Jon Demchick", "Good morning. This is actually John \u2013 for David. ", "David Dvorak", "Hi, John.", "Jon Demchick", "I had a quick follow-up on some of the information that you gave, Mike\u2019s question. The main thing was really just trying to figure out what interest rate you guys are assuming that the new Biomet debt will be able re-finance that?", "Jim Crines", "Yes. You could assume at this point and obviously we haven\u2019t gone to market yet but we will certainly before the closing of the transaction, somewhere in the range of 3.5 of 3.75 on the acquisition debt.", "Jon Demchick", "Okay, very helpful. And further I guess the real question. In December there is some news about the European Commission and needing to divest you know one Knee, one Elbow brand in Europe and then one total knee brand across two specific European countries. I was wondering if you could provide any additional detail to the size and allocation of these products and if not if you can discuss how these divestitures related to your expectations and what you think that means to you heading into FTC approvals in the U.S.?", "David Dvorak", "Sure John as we stated previously the discussions with the regulators are tracking quite consistently with the anti-trust analysis that we performed prior to entering into the merger agreement. As you point out, last month relative to the European Commission we disclosed the proposed remedy package that includes the three pieces that you just referenced and we continue to work with the European Commission to finalize the remaining details for remedy package. We also continue to make progress as it relates to the U.S. and Japan although we are not in a position to provide any specifics on that we would do so as appropriate moving forward and all of this work leads us to reiterating what we said upfront that we still continue to expect to be in a position to close the merger before the end of the first quarter here.", "Jon Demchick", "Thank you very much.", "David Dvorak", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Bob Hopkins", "Well thanks can you hear me, okay.", "David Dvorak", "We can, Bob, good morning.", "Bob Hopkins", "Great, good morning. So just a follow up on Mike\u2019s question and your very helpful commentary about the $7.55 to $7.75 and as you just discussed there is a difference between closing and the beginning at the end of the quarter, you know we calculate that the difference is roughly $0.25 to $0.30 so you would subtract about $0.30 from that $7.55 to $7.75 range. I just want to check with you if that is math that you agree with?", "Jim Crines", "Yes you know Bob they are colors that added color we\u2019ll obviously be able to provide after the transaction closes in terms of what the expectations are so. Particularly with respect to the synergies which you know as we point out you know but still as we indicated back in April we are expecting $135 million in EBIT synergies in the first 12 months following the close, but again, you know those are going to be somewhat back-end loaded in those first 12 months, which you are doing is not unreasonable but again, just be mindful of the fact that as I said that synergies are going to be back-end loaded.", "Bob Hopkins", "Right. So we missed one, you know one quarter of the synergy level or perhaps it\u2019s a little bit more than the $0.30. Okay just trying to try \u2013 to a good number for the combined entity for 2015 relative to the information that you are providing. So two of the really quick things, one, Jim can you just give as far as theQ1 guidance is concerned that $1.58 to $1.60 what is the like-for-like number in the year ago period and then I also wanted to get your views on the U.S. hip number of minus 4% in the quarter that was sort of the one particular weak spot and just wanted to see if you could highlight what you think went on there in a little more detail?", "Jim Crines", "So I said I think first quarter adjusted EPS you know in the prior year was $1.50 and you would add that roughly that had $0.10 to that you can say that the cash you know earnings measure so that the year-to-year comparison you are looking at to hit the similar sort of expectations for bottom line adjusted cash EPS and keep in mind that you know that includes about $0.05 of headwind related to currency ,there is another say couple of pennies of headwind related to the tax rate which will be higher in 2015 relative to2014.", "I will say with respect to the tax rate that there will be opportunities to reduce that overtime, but it requires changes in sourcing that to take time and then finally \u2013 given the fact that we put our share repurchase program on hold there is obviously no leverage you know on those bottom line expectations associated with any share ahead [ph] very little or no leverage associated with share repurchases.", "David Dvorak", "Bob as it relates to the U.S. performance in the hip category that is an area that we look to improve upon moving forward obviously remember that that\u2019s of of a difficult comparison we were in mid single digit growth in the U.S. or there are about in 2013 fourth quarter, so a lot of that sluggishness is driven by the math of the prior year terms. That said, you know we are obviously pushing more focus naturally with the Persona launch on the knee side and we need to energize the sales force and create more focus on the hip side, the product portfolio is very competitive as evidenced by the stronger performance of U.S. within that category. So the opportunity is clearly there.", "Bob Hopkins", "Great. Thanks for the help", "David Dvorak", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] the next question comes from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Matt Taylor", "Hi, thanks for taking the questions, can you hear okay.", "David Dvorak", "We can, good morning.", "Matt Taylor", "Good morning, thanks. Great. So I just wanted to ask a question about your synergy targets. So you mentioned that you are confident in the 270 number and gave the 135 for the first 12 months. I guess if there is one area that people maybe concerned about is commercial disruptions. So the question is kind of a two part, but really around A; what you think on the commercial side and can you give us any update on your integration planning and how your expectations around commercial outcomes and revenue growth are evolving here as you move towards close? And then two, if we saw upside to the 270, where do you think that could come from?", "David Dvorak", "Maybe I\u2019ll take the first part and Jim can respond to the second Matt. I \u2013 this has been a multiple month process for us and the tough news about that is it\u2019s long time to have one of these combination spending, the good news side of it is the capability to plan forward has been extraordinarily and both teams on the Biomet and the Zimmer side have done a terrific job of engaging in those planning processes in a manner that I think puts us in an excellent position to move into the execution phase upon closing.", "And the commercial teams are no exception at all to that we have very detailed plans by territory we made some of the statements upfront because of the nature of the opportunity that we have for cross selling and pulling the product offerings together that we were going to retain every sales position and we stand by that commitment and I would tell you if anything as we get into the detailed planning and the cross selling opportunities get fully characterised, I think those opportunities are every bit as big as what we initially thought and both the revenue the synergies that naturally are going to be part of the integration and the revenue synergy side by virtue of the media [ph] cross sell opportunities are factored into our synergy number that we provided, so that 135 after year one and 270 by year three number is a net number and obviously we continue to be very comfortable that revenue synergy opportunities offsetting some are all the revenue the synergies and then the straight expense synergy element to that nets out to those numbers that we\u2019ve been talking about.", "And the detailed plans exist is well in the same manner for the operational synergy elements of it, so maybe Jim you could comment on other opportunities beyond\u2026", "Jim Crines", "Matt, I would tell you that there will be opportunities beyond the $270 million and we\u2019re getting good visibility to that through the planning process that\u2019s underway. And you know they come in any number of areas including first of all the cross selling opportunities that we\u2019ll have. I think they can very easily be more significant that you know we are planning for at this point.", "So it\u2019s a question of getting the sales channels trained, getting instrument investments in place, getting the surge in training program up in running that will support those opportunities. There will be, there may not be in the first three years, but we are putting longer term plans in place that would tell you with respect to manufacturing, there will be opportunities to drive some significant savings in manufacturing cost overtime as we sort of rationalise the manufacturing plant network and look to source product from the most optimal notes within that network.", "And then the you know the other major sort of source of opportunity will be just getting the right structure in place and you know as you know we\u2019ve had experience in working through a very discipline and some layers you know processed in the past that was very instrumental you know when we kicked off were going to improve programs and getting Zimmer on a standalone basis on the right track in just terms of having the right organization in place with the right spend in some layers drive speed at decision making and efficiency. So we are excited about the opportunities ahead", "Matt Taylor", "Thanks. Thanks a lot for the details.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead", "Larry Biegelsen", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just two questions from me. First, we know you are focussed on paying down debt as quickly as possible. How should we think about the paydown in terms of years and you know related to that how are you going to use the $3 billion of U.S. cash \u2013 gaining to access to that have a favourable impact on accretion in the \u2013 and I had one follow up.", "Jim Crines", "Larry, this is Jim. First of all the bank, syndicated bank facility that we have in place has a term structure to it. And it requires that first end of that we paid down in each of the first three years I think 15 in the fourth year and the balance in the fifth year. So that\u2019s $3 billion of the total acquisition financing. So we at the very least you know will be paying $300 million down in the first year and potentially more. The \u2013 I would tell you when we had talked about that publicly that among other activities you know we\u2019ve been involved in planning in -- planning process that would enable us to get access to the cash being generated at offshore. I believe there is an opportunity to kind of get access to several billion dollars over the next say, five or more years and that will provide the opportunity to perhaps get a share repurchase program reinstated to otherwise might have been able to and you know we\u2019ll provide the management team with an opportunity to head potentially to drive higher accretion.", "David Dvorak", "I would tell you that just in terms of how you may be thinking about long term growth in adjusted EPS, that the longer term plan that the management team is putting together with the flip side of combined company, you know we are targeted at the very least growing bottom line earnings in a range of say 10%.", "Larry Biegelsen", "That\u2019s very helpful. And second for me you gave underlying Zimmer EPS guidance for 2015 before the impact earlier, should we think about the Q1 sales guidance of 1.5% to 2.5% as represented of the full year 2015, is that kind of what\u2019s implied in the EPS guidance you gave us earlier and I\u2019ll drop next.", "David Dvorak", "Well again you know that additional color will be provided after the close of the transaction but it\u2019s fair to say that there\u2019s an expectation that the revenues for the combined entities on a proforma basis, we\u2019ve got to take whatever rent [ph] are required out of the base year but on a proforma basis the expectation would be there will be about a growth sales lets say in at least low single digit.", "Larry Biegelsen", "Thanks for taking the questions.", "David Dvorak", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Bill Plovanic from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.", "Bill Plovanic", "Hi great, thanks, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Really if I could I just like to focus on Asia Pac in Japan. I mean you put up a very solid quarter over there and I\u2019m curious how much of the Asia Pac was driven by Japan and then you know obviously when your competitors saw some challenges, how sticky do you think that business will be?", "David Dvorak", "Well we\u2019ve been performing well for a good number of quarters in the Asia Pacific geographic segment and Japan is obviously our largest business within that segment. But I would tell you that the growth is very broad based and we\u2019ve done well in other important markets including Australia we\u2019ve done very well in important emerging markets, importantly China in that regard which is a very big business for us over there and a very strategic business as well.", "So it is broad based and I think as a consequence of that geographic diversity within the region we feel very comfortable that this is a segment that\u2019s going to continue to perform well for us, so if what you are getting at is how much of that is driven by Japan and is that one time I would tell you that I don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s any element of that within Japan that isn\u2019t sustainable for us with the team that we have in place and I don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s an element of Japan driving the regions performance that would cause the regions positive performance to not be sustainable either. We are in a good place within that market and I felt just strongly about Europe, Middle East and Africa\u2019s performance.", "Bill Plovanic", "And then for Jim just on the guidance the 620 to 630, you mentioned you had a 20%, $0.20 FX headwind for Zimmer in 2015. Does that 620, to 630 include that headwind?", "Jim Crines", "It does. Yes that\u2019s right.", "Bill Plovanic", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Jim Crines", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Joanne Wuensch ", "Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I want to circle back a little bit to what we may think about full year revenue growth to look like on a constant currency basis. Biomet management on their previous their last call briefly mentioned some early the synergies and I think when I speak with investors that topic comes up very frequently recognizing that longer term there obviously are many synergies to be had.", "David Dvorak", "Well just in general our expectations as we said in the beginning Joanne is that on a combined basis to grow after market in the range that Jim provided a couple of questions ago is consistent with that. Right now, I think it\u2019s the case for Jim on a standalone basis where we are obviously performing very strong outside the U.S. and there are categories where we are making the right kinds of improvements within the United States, other categories such as hips where we have more work to do.", "So you know it could be the case that there are some puts and takes to our performance relative to market growth rates once we consummate the transaction and are performing on a combined basis, but we would still expect the combined company in the initial years to perform at market and we believe that we have opportunities where sales for specialization and the innovation pipeline across all opportunities as we progress through the early stages of the execution, integration and get sort of towards the back part of that three year phased integration approach to be able to accelerate to above market rate growth.", "I guess maybe if \u2013 can causes [ph] me to want to just highlight one other point which is there\u2019s a lot of focus about the product category mix and we feel strongly about the strength in the musculoskeletal diversification that comes with this combination. If you look at the non large joint segments, round numbers it will step down as a percentage of the combined company revenues from what Zimmer has on a standalone basis, its 70% to on a combined basis about 60% from large joints or hips and knees.", "And then we were going to have excellent scale opportunities to be leveraged in other product categories including some of the faster growing areas such as sports medicine, extremities and trauma. So that\u2019s a big opportunity as well to shift the mix by product category to faster growing areas and that\u2019s going to help our topline growth rate. We are very optimistic about our build to realize that potential.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Thank you. That fits in perfectly with my second question which is you really did great in spine and dental during the quarter. And selling your products are helping there, but I\u2019m trying to understand since it\u2019s such a change in the previous quarter trajectory, if there was stocking in there or if we just sort of think of this as the start of a new product cycle for those segments?", "David Dvorak", "Yes, I think that \u2013 true Joanne I think it\u2019s a \u2013 it is a bit of a mix of when you describe as it pertains to dental because some of that business is a bit lumpier with stocking distributor orders, but it also is driven by new product introductions. We have a strong regenerative portfolio that we continue to build out and strengthen them, we are completing the Trabecular Metal Dental Implant offering and that\u2019s a premium technology that\u2019s going to help us continue to take share in that market we believe we have the launching in earnest really of the value based implant which is a segment that we\u2019ve had less presence in and a very important segment of that within dental and then we continue to make good progress on our digital dentistry offerings and so we have a lot of product launches and innovations that are hitting the right places within that market. And so I think that our progress there is bright and the future is bright.", "When you look at the spine performance, we probably had ten or a dozen important product launches in 2014, so that\u2019s the culmination of several years of hard work by that team. We\u2019re rounding out our portfolio, we\u2019ve got a lot of traction in that regard and I would tell you the pipeline in that respect is very full as well, so it\u2019s a game changer for us in the sense of the distribution channel can focus exclusively on Zimmer products as opposed to wrapping other company products as we round up that portfolio and I just think if that\u2019s going to create momentum to sustain a nice top line growth opportunity for us and continue to be able to reinvest and maintain that momentum going forward. So, again we are really optimistic about our opportunities in that $9 billion market and it will end up post closing doubling the size of that business combined with the Biomet spine business, so that\u2019s going to create more opportunity.", "Joanne Wuensch ", "Thank you.", "David Dvorak", "You\u2019re welcome", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Please go ahead.", "Mike Matson", "Thanks. I just wanted to ask a question that\u2019s actually sort of not related to the merger with Biomet. So you know just based on some of the discussions I\u2019ve had with people in the industry, channel checks, etcetera it sounds like the Persona Knee and I guess just the newer knees in general are seeing some pushback from hospitals because it sounds like what I\u2019m hearing is that both you guys in J&J have tried to get pricing a little bit of a pricing premium and that\u2019s made it difficult to drive the penetration of those new knees. So I\u2019m just wondering if you know do you think things have changed for the industry in terms of new product launches to the point where it is much harder to drive those and command a little bit of a premium?", "David Dvorak", "There\u2019s no doubt over the last you know five, ten years the capability to realize benefit from mix has become more challenging. That said, I would tell you that market checks are not consistent with the experience that we\u2019ve had with the Persona launch. Either in the penetration of that product or ability to realize a premium for it and to hold that premium, so we\u2019ve been successful in pricing that the way we think it should be priced, there are variance of the Persona system it is a big system that includes cemented, non cemented and we are working towards other elements in the small type phase launch of the Persona system but we\u2019re continuing to be optimistic and quite confident about our ability to execute the premium prices for the element of the technology that we think were in it.", "Mike Matson", "But I guess I just like to challenge out a little because you know looking at the growth rate in knees I mean there hasn\u2019t been much of a differential between the growth that you guys have been putting up and you need a business and change it as well, in fact in some cases we\u2019ve seen better growth in hips from those companies despite having a newer product on the knee side.", "David Dvorak", "Well if you look at the performance that we were generating going back pre Persona launch there\u2019s several 100 basis points of transition over and we clearly have been growing at above market rates with their needs for several quarters now since the launch really took hold, so you know that\u2019s a big business for us. We are about a quarter of the market in knees currently and so it takes a lot to move that needle but Persona has moved that needle so we are quite satisfied with the product itself and the execution on the commercial side.", "Mike Matson", "Okay, thanks. And then just you know the growth rates have slowed I guess for both you and Biomet and so I was wondering if you and do you believe that there has been any disruption ahead of the deal you had spent sort of a long time coming and that\u2019s probably created some uncertainty among employees and sales people.", "David Dvorak", "Well naturally I mean there\u2019s a long tendency period but I think if you look at the company\u2019s overall performance Zimmer\u2019s that is you see a stable performance I think that in markets where you are reliant upon an independent distributor network that uncertainty could lead to a pause on certain actions in investment in particular but I would tell you we\u2019ve been tracking the attrition rates very carefully and have not seen a spike up in that so I think that we are entering the closing period for planning and moving towards consummating the deal and then to the execution of the integration in a very good position to create moment momentum right out of the blocks.", "Mike Matson", "All right. Thank you.", "David Dvorak", "Welcome.", "Bob Marshall", "Julia, we have time for one additional question.", "Operator", "Thank you. The last question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Glenn Novarro", "Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Two broader questions on the overall U.S. knee and hip market and I apologize if you've already addressed this. I've been jumping around conference calls this morning. If I look at the U.S. market in the fourth quarter, Biomet, J&J, Stryker, you guys all came in a little light. I understand it's a tough comp, but I'm wondering if you have any other thoughts or commentary as to why maybe 4Q did come in a little light across the board, at least relative to Street expectations. Is there any chance -- because 3Q came in better -- is there any chance maybe we pull forward some cases in 3Q? So commentary there. And then, in your prepared remarks, you said your outlook for knees and hips for 2015 was up, but can you -- is that U.S? Is that worldwide? Is that units? And then any guidance on pricing for 2015? Thanks", "David Dvorak", "The knee and hip markets on a global basis have performed in a very consistent manner over the last couple of years. If you look at its probably closer to 3% growth rate in 2013 and that was positively impacted most importantly by the uptick in the U.S. hip and knee business market within the fourth quarter of 2013.", "The growth rate for knees and hips on a global basis in 2014 looks like it is close to that same number, maybe 2.5% as opposed to 3 the close to that same number and I think that you\u2019re just going to see stability around that kind of a number on a global basis. The real difference maker in the quarter itself, the fourth quarter of 2014 that is \u2013 is infact the U.S. business where you know those markets look like they were growing not just at low single digits but upper single digits in the prior year comparison that is the fourth quarter of 2013.", "For Zimmer\u2019s business we grew hips mid-single digits and we grew knees low double digits in that quarter and so you just run through the map on that front, Glenn it really does produce a market comp that is much of the explanation for why the market looks a little bit choppy maybe going from Q3 to Q4, but I think overall you want to focus on kind of a two year trend along the lines of what I was describing at the beginning of the reply.", "Glenn Novarro", "Okay. And then the guide or your assumptions for 2015, again, you gave it to me, gave it to us on the call I just want a little more clarification, knee and hip growth is going to be up according to commentary is that U.S. worldwide and what was the pricing assumption for 2015?", "David Dvorak", "Glenn, I think that the overall musculoskeletal market is probably what we were intending to reference with something that approaches mid-single digits because you have some faster growing subsets right within the musculoskeletal market. I think that the growth rate for knees and hips I would estimate along the lines of what I was just describing you know kind of a net 3 percentish range.", "And then as it relates to price we guided for the first quarter in a very consistent manner with going into 2014 expecting minus 2% to minus 3%. We ended the year at minus 2.4% so we don\u2019t see that climate changing in any material way in the first quarter and you could extrapolate that as a view as to what we would expect to see in 2015 at this point.", "Glenn Novarro", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "David Dvorak", "You\u2019re welcome.", "David Dvorak", "So with that I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining the call today and for your continued interest and support for Zimmer. We look forward to speaking to you on our first quarter conference call which is scheduled for 08:00 am on April 30. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to you Julie.", "Operator", "Thank you again for participating in today's conference call.

Bijou - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Operator", "Good morning, I would like to turn the call over to Bob Marshall, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Marshall you may begin your call.", "Robert J. Marshall", "Thank you Julie. Good morning and welcome to Zimmer\u2019s Q1 2015 earnings conference call. I'm here with our CEO David Dvorak and our CFO Jim Crines. As a reminder our earnings release and related financial information is available on our investor relations website at investor.zimmer.com. A replay of this call will also be made available on our website.", "Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties. Also, the discussions during this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures.

The results in the company\u2019s earnings release this morning reflect constant currency growth rate including the extra billing days in the first quarter of 2015 that resulted from the change in our interim quarter end closing convention for the majority of our international reporting unit from March 25 to March 31 that\u2019s referenced on our previous earnings call.", "With that, I'll now turn the call over to David Dvorak. David.", "David C. Dvorak", "Thank you, Bob and good morning, everyone. Before I review our first quarter financial results I would like to take a few moments to share our vision for the future of Zimmer Biomet. I\u2019ll then discuss our first quarter performance and Jim will provide further financial details. As Bob has just noted I\u2019ll state all sales variances on a constant currency day-rate basis and all earnings results on an adjusted basis.", "During the first quarter we were pleased to announce that the European Commission and the Japan Fair Trade Commission granted clearance of Zimmer\u2019s planned combination with Biomet. We now expect to close the transaction during the month of May as we work towards clearance from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.", "If we've communicated previously the rationale behind this merger has always been about enhanced scale and the opportunity to accelerate the pace of innovation across our musculoskeletal portfolio. We think that in the wake of this historic combination we\u2019ll be well positioned to capitalize on future growth opportunities.", "Zimmer Biomet\u2019s comprehensive and diversified portfolio of musculoskeletal conditions will offer more scalable and predictable revenues as well as immediate cross selling opportunities. Our enhanced scale and broadened product portfolio will also enable us to enter exciting new products categories such as sports medicine as well as continuing to expand our participation in key emerging markets around the globe.", "There are also a number of financial and operational synergies connected with this transaction that are highly consistent with Zimmer\u2019s longstanding value creation framework. Moreover, we're confident in the organization\u2019s ability to execute effectively on a combined basis following the closure of the deal creating and returning value to our stockholders over the long-term.", "Against the backdrop of these transformational changes, we remain a company fuelled by innovation and driven by our passion to restore mobility, alleviate pain and improve quality of life for patients around the world. Our combined research and development teams will leverage our enhanced resources to efficiently and cost effectively bring the new generation of musculoskeletal technologies and broad clinical solutions to market.", "Turning now to our performance. In the first quarter, Zimmer continued to produce steady sales growth in several geographies and product categories while meeting our financial commitment and delivering expanded operating margin leverage. Consolidated net sales for the first quarter were $1.13 billion, an increase of 1.7% and our earnings per share were $1.58 a decrease of 1.3% from the prior year period.", "Our sales increased by 1.3% in the Americas, by 2.1% in Europe, Middle East and Africa region, and our Asia Pacific business delivered 2.6% growth over the prior year period. In the first quarter, we saw global musculoskeletal markets continue to demonstrate stability consistent with trends in the previous two years. Zimmer experienced a price decline of 2.2% in the quarter which was consistent with our expectations coming into the year.", "Turning to our product categories, first quarter sales for our leading knee business increased by solid 3.9% reflecting positive volume and mix of 6.7% and negative price of 2.8%. Our Americas segment reported a sales increase of 4.3% while the Asia-Pacific region delivered 4.1% growth and our Europe, Middle East and Africa business grew by 2.8% over the prior year period.", "The quarter was marked by steady gains for Persona, the personalized knee system, which we continue to successfully position in concert with our advanced intelligent instrument offerings including iASSIST, the personalized guidance system, patient specific instruments, and the eLIBRA soft tissue balancing system. We\u2019ll continue to broaden and differentiate our knee portfolio including our growing line of early intervention solutions along with a continuum of care such as our Gel-One cross link Hyaluronate treatment and our expanded Zimmer knee creation Subchondroplasty offering.", "It is also important to note that this year marks the 20th anniversary of our leading next gen knee replacement system with more than 5 million implantations completed to-date. Patients around the world continue to benefit from the safe joint flexion and restored natural kinematics that the next gen system offers. Just as next gen marked a major step forward for total knee replacement two decades ago, we intend to continue setting the pace for innovation in the years ahead.", "Turing to Zimmer\u2019s hip business, sales decreased by 0.6% in the quarter reflecting positive volume and mix of 2.1% and negative price of 2.7%. These results include a sales increase of 1.3% in Asia-Pacific, 1.4% increase in Europe, Middle East and Africa, and 3.2% decrease in the Americas. As we focus our U.S. execution in the quarters ahead, we expect that premium constructs will continue to drive penetration and deliver improved growth.", "These offerings include the Continuum Acetabular system which leverages platform Zimmer technologies such as Trabecular Metal material and our Vivacit-E vitamin E-infused bearing material, which recently completed 100 million cycles of wear testing and continues to demonstrate ultralow wear properties. And notably, since receiving regulatory clearance in several European markets last November, the Synovasure diagnostic test for periprosthetic joint infection has already delivered promising early sales results.", "In extremities, Zimmer recorded growth of 3.1% in the first quarter. Our sales for this business continue to be driven by the performance of our Trabecular Metal reverse shoulder, which now features our platform Vivacit-E advanced bearing material. We also continued our growth into anatomical adjacencies with premium solutions. The Trabecular Metal total ankle system continues to perform well and the Nexel Total Elbow is attracting a growing number of surgeons seeking the clinical advantages of Vivacit-E.", "Zimmer dental sales decreased by 5.7% in the first quarter. A stable performance in the U.S. was offset by challenging sales comparisons in the Asia Pacific region owing to stocking patterns of our distributor network in Japan and accelerated growth of the China market in the prior year period. However we continue to gain traction with our value based offerings designed in the PI Branemark philosophy in key European markets.", "Looking forward we will continue to focus our execution behind building sales of our market leading dental regenitive portfolio as well as our premium Trabecular Metal dental implants, Zimmer Trauma grew sales by 3.4% in the first quarter, we continue to achieve steady sales results from our differentiated trauma portfolio including sales of the Zimmer Natural Nail family and the Zimmer NCB Periprosthetic Locking Plating System.", "Trauma is a particularly exciting opportunity concerning our pending combination with Biomet, as we seek to leverage our enhanced resources to accelerate the development of proprietary innovation that are clinically and economically relevant for the global trauma market.", "Zimmer Spine delivered solid 5.4% growth over the prior year period building on the success commercialization of a dozen new solutions in 2014 including the Virage OCT Spinal Fixation System, Optio-C Anterior Cervical System and our expanded line of Puros Demineralized Bone Matrix grafting solutions. These innovative new offerings are driving growth and enhancing the diversification and competitiveness of our signed portfolio as we execute on our broadened portfolio we will continue to advance proven strategies and sustain our focus on promising market adjacencies such as minimally invasive surgeries.", "Zimmer Surgical and other sales were flat in the first quarter and included a solid performance by our surgical power tools in the Asia Pacific region and bone cement products in certain European markets. We also achieve steady growth in our wounded solutions particularly in the United States.", "As we move forward and away from challenging sales comparisons in the prior operating periods we will continue to grow our presence in the operating room suite through the expansion of these and other clinically relevant solutions that meet the needs of our surgical customers.", "With that I will now ask Jim to provide further details on the first quarter and our updated guidance. Jim?", "James T. Crines", "Thank you, David. This morning I will review our first quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our standalone earnings guidance as well as anticipated accretion and synergies connected with the pending merger with Biomet.", "Total revenues for the first quarter were $1.13 billion an increase of 1.7% on a constant currency day rate basis when compared to the first quarter of 2014, net currency impact for the quarter decreased revenues by 6.8% or $80 million, our adjusted growth profit margin was 75.8% for the quarter favorable to prior year by 90 basis points after adjusting for non-cash amortization expense. Foreign currency hedge gains together with favorable mix of products in geographic revenues and cost savings from our operational excellence initiatives were offset in part by higher excess in obsolescence charges and the impact of negative price.", "The company\u2019s R&D expense increased 2.2% or $1 million on a quarter basis to 4.3% of net sales when compared to the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $425 million in the first quarter and 37.5% of sales with 80 basis points below the prior year quarter after adjusting for non-cash amortization expense. The company continues to make strides in driving efficiencies throughout its operating units in administrative as well as commercial functions. In the quarter, the company recorded pre-tax charges of $87 million in special items and $3.9 million and cost of products sold pertaining to global restructuring, quality and operational excellence initiatives, and recent acquisition.", "The company also recorded $20.4 million in non-cash amortization charges during the quarter, adjusted first quarter 2015 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these charges. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to $386.2 million at 34% our adjusted operating profit to sales ratio is 150 basis points higher than the prior year first quarter after adjusting for non-cash amortization expense.", "This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement reflecting the ongoing progress we\u2019ve made with our operational excellence programs as well as a positive impact of hedge gains and mixed benefits associated with the number of new products introductions across our broad portfolio of musculoskeletal solutions.", "Adjusted net interest expense for the quarter amounted to $12 million, which was flat when compared to the prior year quarter. This excludes $28 million of acquisition related finance charges, adjusted net earnings worth $272.8 million for the first quarter, a decrease of 0.6% when compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 1.3% to a dollar and $1.58 on 172.9 million average outstanding diluted shares.", "Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.6% and was 200 basis points higher when compared to prior year, due principally to the impact of foreign currency translation on foreign source earning as well as the exclusion of non-cash expenses in adjusted earnings. Our reported effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.7% at $1.2 reported diluted earnings per share decreased 20.9% for the prior year first quarter repeated EPS of $1.29.", "Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $92 million, a decrease of 52% from $188.8 million in the first quarter of 2014. The decrease was driven primarily by the settlement of a pre-issuance hedge associated with our recently completed senior notes offering. Those inventories were $1.2 billion at the end of the first quarter, an increase of $48 billion from December 31, 2014. As I have noted on previous calls, the increase is due primarily to the support of ongoing commercialization of new product offerings as well as the affects of placing more inventory into distributor hospital consignments.", "Adjusted inventory days on hand finished the quarter at 389 days as compared to 334 days at the prior year quarter end. As of the end of the first quarter, net receivables increased $869.8 million from $939.1 million in the first quarter of 2014 or 7% lower than in the prior year. Our adjusted trade accounts receivable days sales outstanding finished the quarter at 64 days, one day improved when compared with the prior year.", "Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter amounted to $89 million. Free cash flow in the first quarter was a net outflow of $9.3 million; $113.3 million lower than the first quarter of 2014. We define free cash flow as operating cash flow less cash outlays for instruments and property, plant, and equipment.", "The decrease in free cash flow was driven by lower operating cash flows as I\u2019ve just noted as well as our continuous investment in support of the ongoing large of new products through increased instrument deployments as we expand commercialization of newer products globally. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $96.8 million, including $62.4 million for instruments and $34.4 million from property, plant, and equipment.", "I would now like to make a fuel remarks regarding guidance. As indicated in our release, we anticipate closing the pending Biomet transaction in the month of May. Upon closing, we will provide additional details regarding our expected full-year performance inclusive of Zimmer standalone and in combination with Biomet for the balance of the year. As such, I will provide a few updates to the numbers I have previously communicated.", "Before returning to the financial guidance specifically, I want to reiterate the company\u2019s perspective on the market and general pricing dynamics. We continue to view the global knee and hip markets, the growing in low single digits for the full year, market growth drivers including the ageing of the global population, positive outcomes associated with joint replacements and other musculoskeletal procedures, and increasing utilization in emerging markets resulting in consistent trends in procedure demand in our view. We also continue to forecast a relatively stable global pricing environment with expectations of price for Zimmer to be down between 2% and 3% as compared to the prior year.", "Turning back to guidance, as indicated in our release we now project full-year 2015 adjusted diluted earnings per share for Zimmer on a standalone basis to be in the range of $6.30 to $^.40. We expect foreign currency translation will decrease our reported revenues for the full-year year by 6.5% to 7%, because our hedging program only offsets the impact of currency used on earnings, our updated guidance reflects further strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies since our last earnings call.", "Lower anticipated earnings and profits from our international units has to further effect of changing the anticipated mix of those earnings and profits in favor of higher tax domestic operating unit, we therefore now anticipate the adjusted effective tax rate for Zimmer on a standalone basis to be approximately 27% for the full-year. A similar rate is expected for the combined enterprise post closing this compares with previous guidance of 26% to 26.5%.", "Turning to synergies and accretion associated with a pending Biomet merger as indicated in our release, we now expect accretion of $0.95 to $1.05 and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the first 12 months following the close of the transaction. This change is related to increased foreign exchange headwind associated with the acquired revenue of Biomet. Additionally, assuming the transaction close in May, we would anticipate approximately one-third of the accretion to be realized in calendar year 2015.", "After extensive integration planning which has been ongoing since the announcement of the pending merger with Biomet, we now expect net annual operating synergies to reach $350 million by year three post close. This compares with prior guidance of $270 million, with this in mind and assuming the pending merger transaction is closed no later than the end of May, we would expect revenues to grow organically between 1.5% and 2.5% over pro forma 2014 revenues or between $6.17 billion and $6.2 billion.", "This revenue number includes our expectations for divestiture remedy; we anticipate the diluted weighted average shares outstanding for 2015 to be between 193.5 million and 194 million shares including the shares issued to consummate the Biomet transaction. Together with the anticipated synergies, we would expect calendar year 2015 adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $6.60 to $6.80.", "For 2016 modeling purposes there are certain timing issues to consider. Only a modest amount of the $135 million in year one post, post synergies are reflected in the calendar year 2015 earnings guidance. That is due to the lag in capturing projected cost synergies in contrast to the immediate negative effect to the anticipated remedies. Those remedies generally take the form of product line divestitures which will result in an immediate loss of revenue and associated operating earnings.", "As we indicated in our last call synergies realization will be more heavily weighted to the back half of first 12 months post closing and accelerate into subsequent operating periods. As a result this anticipated phasing as well as the announced increase of projected synergies we expect the growth rate and adjusted diluted earnings per share beyond calendar year 2015 to also accelerate.", "As an example, 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share should grow at mid teens or higher rate compared to 2015 guidance of 650 to 680. Lastly for 2016, you should be using a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately $209 million. Finally, please not that other than Biomet our guidance does not include any impact from potential business developmental activities or other unforeseen events.", "David, I'll now turn the call over to your.", "David C. Dvorak", "Thanks Jim. Zimmer made good progress in the first quarter of 2015 which would not have been possible without the dedication of our team members around the globe. In addition to achieving steady global revenues and driving ongoing commercial releases, we've been fully committed to integration anticipation of our pending combination with Biomet.", "Our new company will be forged in the principles and best practices that have made both Zimmer and Biomet leaders in the musculoskeletal healthcare. On that basis we look forward to continuing to serve the global healthcare community with innovative solutions and compelling value.", "And now I would like to ask Julie to begin the Q&A portion of our call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] if you can please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. The first question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America, please go ahead.", "Robert A. Hopkins", "Great, thank you. Can you hear me okay?", "David C. Dvorak", "We can Bob. Good morning.", "Robert A. Hopkins", "Great. Good morning. So, the first question I want was is just on the actual Biomet deal. It seems like the FTC is taking longer than you initially thought. I was wondering if you could give a sense as to why and is the reason that they want to wait until their remedies are actually executed?", "David C. Dvorak", "Well, there are differing requirements in different jurisdictions. It is the case that for instance, in Japan you can come to an agreement as to what the divestiture needs to look like and then subsequent to the closing of the primary transaction execute on that, whereas it\u2019s a more concurrent requirement with the closing in jurisdictions like Europe and the United States. But to back up a little bit on the status, Bob, in general, we\u2019re very pleased to have received the clearances from both the European Commission and Japan FTC. As you know that we\u2019re focused on the US FTC, but I would add that we\u2019re encouraged by the substantial progress we\u2019re making to complete the final steps there as well and it is our expectation that we\u2019re going to get the transaction closed in May. ", "And maybe just add a little bit more color to that. In the scheme of the overall transaction, this category is coming up very consistent with what we anticipated in our diligence work pre-execution of the deal and I think we\u2019re going to land in a very good place and it just took a little bit longer than we thought.", "Robert A. Hopkins", "But the main reason, just to be clear, for it taking a little bit longer than you thought is the process around remedies, is that a fair statement?", "David C. Dvorak", "That\u2019s correct.", "Robert A. Hopkins", "And then as a follow-up, on the guidance, two quick things. One, just doing some quick math here. It looks like what you\u2019re comfortable with for calendar 2016 is something below $8 a share. So, one, is that correct? And also Jim, could you just highlight the different buckets of what\u2019s changed in the guidance since you last communicated to us at the end of the Q4 call in terms of either specifics on FX or synergy or financing costs, you talked about tax rate. Just wondering what changed and if my math is right that you\u2019re kind of comfortable for now a little bit below $8 for 2016?", "David C. Dvorak", "So, I guess, first of all, yes, we\u2019re comfortable with something below $8, but 2016 obviously based on the mid-teens or higher, sort of, growth rate expectation. Understanding, Bob, that there is a lot of work to do between now and 2016 in developing operating plans which is what we would typically be doing before providing a more detailed guidance, which will come, eventually.", "And then with respect to what has changed is really two things, I guess, well, maybe three, the timing. So, the realization of the synergy is, obviously, the basing of the actions that have to occur to capture those synergies doesn\u2019t happen until obviously we close the transaction. To the extent that there\u2019s been a slight delay in our expectations with respect to when the transaction would close, the opportunity we have to capture those synergies just gets deferred. Secondly, the headwind associated with foreign currency translation is the other most - really the most significant change and that\u2019s reflected both in the update that we\u2019ve provided on the standalone guidance as well as the $0.10 take-down and the accretion expectations for the first 12 months post closing.", "The one other change you I think mentioned as well is the fact that we are anticipating relative to our original modeling a somewhat higher effective tax rate and that really is a result of both the effect of foreign currency translation is having on the foreign earning, post Zimmer and Biomet as well as on the fact that the interest cost associated with the deal financing significantly below what we had originally anticipated. So if you go back to the original deal model we would have had a more significant tax shelter in the U.S. associated with the deal financing and those - that really covers the three things that I said that are impacting on the change in the outlook.", "Robert A. Hopkins", "I just one more and I will let others jump in here, but could you give us - what was the FX hit on the combined company in Q4 versus the FX hit now because the guidance before was including some other things like you said for Biomet it was $0.30 offset by $0.20 of savings from interest and then Zimmer was $0.20 net of hedging. Can you just give us a sense as to how much currency is a headwind now versus the beginning of the year?", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure, well on a standalone basis it is another $0.05 or so a quarter obviously with take down of $0.20 and that is a combination of the FX as well as the pressure we are seeing with respect to the effect of tax rate and on Biomet it is a little more than the $0.10 take down because there is an offset in the form of some interest savings relative to what our expectations were prior to launching the senior notes.", "Robert A. Hopkins", "Very good. I will get back in queue. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Matthew C. Taylor", "Hi thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask you guys about the closing here, you are saying May now instead of April. Can you just talk about the last steps for closing in the U.S. and what is your guidance imply when you\u2019re talking about the lower growth for the year in terms of U.S. divestiture? Can you talk about what it looks like versus Europe or Japan?", "David C. Dvorak", "There really isn\u2019t too much more to add Matt to the status of the clearances, it\u2019s U.S. focused at this point in time and we do anticipate receiving FTC clearance in the United States and being able to bring the transaction to close in the month of May.", "James T. Crines", "Yes, and with respect to the divestitures when we quote the 1.5% to 2% constant currency growth expectation for the top line that is over pro forma 2014 revenues so where that is really an apples and apples comparison we stripped out the anticipated divested revenues out of 2014, and then where the divestiture, the divested revenues hasn\u2019t impacted obviously on the accretion expectations and nothing has changed with respect to the impact that those divested - product lines divestitures are going to have in relation to accretion. What has changed as I said is the foreign currency headwind that we\u2019ve now factored into the updated guidance on accretion.", "Matthew C. Taylor", "And maybe just taking a step back if you think about the guidance that you\u2019ve provided along for the transaction conceptually I guess number one, are you seeing any disruption with the combination around the corner and do you still expect that you can grow in line with the market and faster than the market after the merger closes?", "David C. Dvorak", "We absolutely do Matt being that we characterize the progression from the point of close integration beyond this guidance is consistent with that in line with market in the initial stages accelerating above market is we get deeper into executing these plans, so no changes whatsoever it come of our integration plan, I would tell you that the intermediate to longer term I think there would be opportunity is even greater to create value by virtue of this combination and that should be reflected in the intermediate to long term on the top line?", "Matthew C. Taylor", "Great, thank you very much.", "David C. Dvorak", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you the next question comes from Mike Weinstein from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Michael Weinstein", "Hi good morning guys, just want to start with the quarter Jim can you just outline for us the impact of difference in selling days outside the U.S. think you had couple more days this quarter than you had the year ago?", "James T. Crines", "That is very Mike so that accounts for about 2.5 points of growth on the top line and that is why the all the growth rate that we quoted in our comments had been adjusted to strip out the effects of the extra billing days to help you have an opportunity to go back through the transcript will get the day rate growth both consolidated and by product category.", "Michael Weinstein", "Okay. That\u2019s very helpful thanks Jim. So, let me just circle back now on the 2015 implied guidance, you know, Bob asked the question. Are you basically endorsing something below $8, but maybe just to be a little bit clearer that because the mid teens are better growth could apply anything from $7.50 all the way up to $8? Do you want to be any tighter relative to that band just to street expectations or corporately release that?", "James T. Crines", "Well, you know, at this stage, again, to the extent that we haven\u2019t done, you know, the bottom up operating plans for 2016, it\u2019s right to think about a wider range perhaps then to put a finer point to it. You know, something in the order of 15% to 20%, but I think you\u2019ll get beyond that. The range gets to be a bit too wide.", "Michael Weinstein", "Yes, understood. Let me just ask the last question, maybe then just on the comment you made about pro forma revenue growth and I think what you said was 1.5%, 2% revenue growth, and correct me if I am wrong, pro forma once the deal is closed. That\u2019s what included the impact to divestiture. So, are you saying that the divestiture is way down to 1.5% to 2% or that\u2019s adjusted for the divestitures?", "James T. Crines", "Adjusted. So, it\u2019s1.5% to 2.0% and we\u2019ve taken out\u2026", "Michael Weinstein", "Apart.", "James T. Crines", "Yes, we\u2019ve taken out what we anticipate will be the divestiture revenues out of the base.", "Michael Weinstein", "So, you\u2026", "James T. Crines", "Yes.", "Michael Weinstein", "So, that basically would imply pro forma growth pretty consistent with what the company is doing right now?", "James T. Crines", "That\u2019s correct and understand, you know, with the deal is now anticipated to close in May. I mentioned that there is a lag capturing cost synergies. There\u2019s also a lag in capturing the cross selling opportunities. Those will wrap up over time and that\u2019s reflected in that top line expectation for calendar year 2015.", "Michael Weinstein", "Okay and one last question I\u2019ll sneak in. So, are you at a point where you can give us a little bit more in terms of what you\u2019re doing with the sales organization to maybe tie up some of the better reps and distributors post close?", "James T. Crines", "We have very well-developed plans, but wouldn\u2019t want to start articulating anything, you know, specific in advance of the closing and the execution of those plans, Mike. I think in that area though, it\u2019s probably worth noting that our stability within the sales force is quite good on a global basis. We\u2019re not seeing accelerated attrition rates and I think we are going to enter the period to execute this plan in a very good position.", "Michael Weinstein", "Great. Thank you guys.", "David C. Dvorak", "Appreciate it.", "James T. Crines", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Glenn J. Novarro", "Hi! Good morning guys. One of the things you did this morning is you raised your net annual sales synergy guidance from $270 million to $350 million and in the guidance there is an assumption for sales dis-synergies near-term plus costs savings. So, can you walk us through what\u2019s changed, are the dis-synergies a little bit greater and the cost saving is a little bit greater, serving as an offset. Just a little bit more clarity there.", "David C. Dvorak", "Yeah, Glenn I think that we haven\u2019t provided a breakout. You\u2019re right to reference that synergy number as a net number, but just to give you a directional response. It is more related to opportunity on the expense synergy side than any change in assumption on revenue dis-synergy.", "Glenn J. Novarro", "Okay, and what are you saying from a cost savings point of view today that gives you more confidence that it would come in greater?", "David C. Dvorak", "Well, we obviously had the ability over the last many months to get access to a lot more information and bring teams together and do a lot more detailed planning and it\u2019s really with that information and the process that we\u2019ve been executing to on the development of these plans that clarify the opportunity and we feel very, very confident in the opportunity, the plans that have been developed, and in our capability to execute and realize those savings.", "Glenn J. Novarro", "Okay, and then just one quick on the end market. Your hip number relative to our expectations came in a little bit light, but so did some of the competition as well and I know from year-to-year, some years knees do better than hips and so forth. Do you have a feel for why maybe hips have come in a little bit lighter to start off the year and then as a follow up, do you have a view on robotics coming out of AAOS, you heard more than robotics, you heard Smith & Nephew and J&J doing some partnering. Just your view on robotics going forward as well?", "James T. Crines", "I think that the worldwide hip market does look like it has stepped down a bit from what it came in at for the entire year 2014; I wouldn\u2019t over read that one quarter data point. However, it felt to us though more of that was driven in the United States we had a little bit of a step down market growth rate wise as well noted in Asia Pacific but I don\u2019t see any major trend that is driving that that would be indicative what one should anticipate for the balance of the year and would still try to take more towards an expectation of 2015 is going to look a lot like 2014 and 2013 overall with respect to robotics again we very much believe in innovating our way that improves the quality of care and outcomes and at the same time does so in economically responsible in responsive way to various stakeholders within the system for several years now.", "We have been developing technologies that we believe are smaller, cheaper, faster to bring about better clinical solutions and reproducible solutions in a cost efficient way and continue to believe that those platform technologies including our high assist and patient specific instruments in soft tissue balancing systems pre operative planning systems and then as I mentioned these inter-operative technologies are going to be able to serve customers and patients very well in that regard. So we think that the need is there, our solution and strategy within that space is a bit different approach and we are very confident that we are on a great track to deliver value to those stakeholders.", "We don\u2019t think that going backwards in procedure time for example for changing the work flow in a fundamental way is going to lead to better patient outcomes and in fact those patients outcomes could be said in reverse relative to current capabilities and that is one area that one is going to have to be mindful of but it\u2019s an exciting area for innovation in general and we like our platform technologies and the strategies that we have in place and we are executing to.", "Glenn J. Novarro", "Okay, thank you.", "David C. Dvorak", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Rich Newitter from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.", "Richard S. Newitter", "Hi thanks for taking the question. I just was wondering just going back to the timing of the deal, I know that you feel confident in the deal closing in the May but I\u2019m just curious how should we or how can you help us get comfortable that the deal close in May is in fact the right time when previously it was April and then before that you were very confident that it was 1Q, 2015 just maybe help us get a better feeling that May is in fact probably the last potential push out or is that even a fair conclusion to draw?", "David C. Dvorak", "We are confident in closing in the month of May and I guess that the fact these split would emphasize with you is that we have regulatory filings across the globe as it relates and you\u2019re trying to estimate the specific timing for close with a lot of variables in that equation originally we are now down to the point where we have one jurisdiction and you should assume that we are pretty knowledgeable about what is outstanding within that jurisdiction and what our path forward the optionality to address any issues that are open within United States and so it\u2019s a shorter list, we\u2019re very knowledgeable and well positioned to address what needs to get addressed and on that basis are expressing a high degree of confidence that we\u2019re going to get it done in May.", "Richard S. Newitter", "Got it. And then just one follow-up, I was on another call earlier, so if someone asked this, I apologize but just we\u2019ve also have heard from some competitors that are attempting to move down a more value implant route there has been talk of value implants. can you provide your thoughts on how the market may or may not accept this type of offering and what is Zimmer and Biomet\u2019s competitive response should it actually begin to take off? Thanks.", "James T. Crines", "Well I think that the positioning of technologies and the solutions, one needs to make sure that we are innovating in a way and delivering value to a system that is going to increasingly become cost conscious and has for the last many years. The data points that I think are worth emphasizing is the stability of the pricing environment, it\u2019s a pretty narrow bandwidth in our experience over the last not just quarter or two but couple of years, by way of price experience, we\u2019re continuing to maintain price and retrieve mix opportunities for our premium technologies and all those price points.", "And the last point that I think is worth emphasizing is that competition is healthy if we can prove out value for the premium technologies then those prices won\u2019t be held but that\u2019s a fair challenge that should be placed on anyone that\u2019s operating within these marketplaces.", "It\u2019s going to be the case, however, that if one of these so called value implant providers cause harmful effects to patient outcomes that with the movement away from fee for service in jurisdictions like the United States and the cost of re-admissions or complications in those cases being internalized relative to the provider they are going to care deeply about making sure that they get a right for the patient as they should. So if someone is out to save a little bit of money in exchange for not delivering the right kind of patient outcome, the economic system is going to penalize that provider in a material way in a much more significant manner than it has historically.", "So we like the clinical results, the quality systems, the attention to detail in the design, manufacture, and commercialization of these solutions living this world and are highly confident that we understand what the stakeholders and customers expectations are and how to partner even more deeply with those providers to bring about a great patient outcome in a cost effective way in the future. And if anything are even more excited about our opportunity and confident in our capability to contribute to that to that equation by virtue of the Biomet combination.", "Richard S. Newitter", "Thank you.", "David C. Dvorak", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes is from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Please, go ahead.", "David H. Roman", "Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I want to switch back to the business a little bit and ask a couple of product line questions. And specifically, I was hoping you could just give us a little bit of an update on the trauma business given what has been some fluctuation in the growth rate in the past couple of quarters that looked to have stabilized, but maybe help us understand the opportunities there going forward. And then secondly, spine, I think you are now going on three pretty solid quarters particularly in the United State. Could you may be just help us understand what are the drivers underpinning that turnaround and can we see that growth continues as the comparisons get harder in the back half of this year?", "James T. Crines", "Sure. With respect to trauma we stepped backwards a little bit initially over the last few quarters and our U.S. performance maintained pretty solid performance in the OUS markets and there sort of a simple answer to the progress that we\u2019ve made, we\u2019ve invested in our product portfolio an innovation the Zimmer Natural Nail line is an example of that, the NCB periprosthetic plating system is another good example of that. Our XtraFix system showing up that capability on the external fixation has lead us to a much more competitive portfolio more recently just a radius platting system getting launched and we\u2019ve really rounded out our portfolio and put our commercial teams in a better position to compete.", "And the other half of that is sales force specialization and focus and I think that we\u2019ve advanced more rapidly in the OUS markets, in the U.S. markets. But I think we\u2019re beginning to catch up in the U.S. markets. When you look at the platform that we\u2019ve created on the Zimmer side and add to that which is a substantial ad what Biomet possesses by way of product portfolio, all the does is enhance our capability to win and take share within the trauma space post closing the deal. It also enhances our capability to build out sales forces that are specialized within the trauma marketplace wherever that makes sense to do so geographically across the globe.", "So, it\u2019s one of the areas among several sports, medicine, extremities, trauma, surgical, where this combination and the scale are going to greatly enhance our growth opportunities and I\u2019m very confident that were you going to see is those businesses collectively picking up our overall top line performance as we get deeper into the integration and executing the cross-sell opportunities and the build out of the commercial team.", "Spine is a similar story. You know, it was all about investing and innovation. We had about 12 launches in 2014. There is a lot of a runway with those launches in the pipeline and the Zimmer side is rich. The person were picking up through the Biomet combination are very, very complimentary to the Zimmer portfolio. So, day one, we\u2019re going to end up with a very competitive offering on the core fusion side and some really terrific innovations within the pipeline, and again, a stronger than ever sales Force team on a global basis.", "So, I would expect us to continue to perform very well. You know, obviously, have more visibility to the Zimmer spine business at this point in time, but I\u2019m highly confident in our ability to sustain those attractive growth rates or if anything accelerate on the Zimmer side going forward for our spine business.", "David H. Roman", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful and maybe just as a follow-up on the P&L, Jim. I know in your prepared remarks you talked about some of the drivers of gross margin. Can you maybe just go into a little bit more detail just on how much of that is hedging, where it\u2019s hedging gains versus performance in the underlying business and then presumably foreign currency rates hold where they are, that has benefit becomes a headwind as you analyze that. So, the underlying gross margin of the business probably being a little bit lower, than that [7.5%, 8%] [ph] the year quoting for this quarter?", "James T. Crines", "Okay, well so let me start with the foreign currency hedge gains that were recognized in the quarter. We recognized, David, $28 million in cash flow hedge gains in the quarter compared to approximately $5 million in the prior year quarter. You know that\u2019s a detail that we provide in our periodic disclosures. You\u2019ll be able to track, you know, what\u2019s getting recognized and what we expect to recognize over the next 12 months.", "That difference year-over-year, by itself about two points of improvement in the ratio, but that is offset by approximately 130 basis points related to higher access and obsolescence charges in the quarter compared to the prior year quarter. The higher charges you know, charges were driven by ongoing commercialization in new products as well as the effect of placing more inventories into distributor and hospital consignments and a product recall as well in the quarter that higher-level of charges in the quarter is expected to moderate going forward.", "David H. Roman", "Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.", "James T. Crines", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Bill Plovanic from Canaccord. Please go ahead.", "William J. Plovanic", "Great. Thanks. Good morning. Can you hear me okay?", "James T. Crines", "We can Bill, good morning.", "William J. Plovanic", "Good morning. So, actually just a point of clarification if I could. As you discuss divestitures, you\u2019ve already divested the European assets and then as you look at what you know what you have two divest in Japan and then, you know, there\u2019s a range for which you were you looking at in the US. I was just wondering if you could provide nominally the combined Biomet/Zimmer, you know, what was that on a nominal basis whether an exact or a range, it\u2019s just to help us for modeling. Then, secondly, when you talked about closure in many you know, should we think late May or June 1 or May 1. How should we think about that in the model?", "James T. Crines", "Sure. Well, first of all, I don\u2019t want to at this stage because, you know, we haven\u2019t closed the transaction or completed the divestitures even in Europe. Although, we have, obviously, signed definitive agreements, we have still yet to close. You know, that\u2019s a detail, Bill, that were just going to hold off providing until the transaction closes but one we understand that will need to be provided once it does close and then your other\u2026", "William J. Plovanic", "Just for the closing day, should we - you\u2019re talking about May. When in May should we\u2026", "James T. Crines", "Yeah. Well, I\u2019ll just share with you the basis for some of the internal modeling that we\u2019ve done and further guidance, you know, that we\u2019ve provided, just a bit naked a little simpler for us; maybe for you as well the end of May.", "William J. Plovanic", "Okay. Great. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.", "David R. Lewis", "Good morning. I thought I\u2019d come back to the 16 synergies for a second. So, you have a couple of dynamics. You\u2019re obviously raising long-term synergy numbers around 20%, but the 16 number obviously is falling below a lot of the consensus expectations and you talked about a few issues FX, tax, and timing, but tax and FX seem largely accounted for. So, the biggest factor seems to be timing and I\u2019m trying to figure out is this deal close timing or the realization of synergy timing because it feels like the latter, but could you give us a lot more detail on that second piece if it truly is the realization of synergy timing because it doesn\u2019t seem like a four to six week delay in the deal would move the number in 2016 that dramatically. So it must be on the backend, but it\u2019s hard to understand exactly what that is and if you could give us more detail that would be great, and a quick follow-up.", "James T. Crines", "I should tell you, David, that it is deal close timing. You know, as you know, we\u2019ve reiterated our expectations for synergies in the first 12 months following the closing of the transaction at $135 million. So, that\u2019s not changed and then we\u2019ve actually increased, as you said, the guidance for total synergies by years three to $350 million from $270 million.", "Now, it is the case that, that additional $80 million will come later, not in the first 12 months obviously, but it will come in years two and three following the closing of the transaction. In reference to an earlier question, I talked about the three things that have really changed relative to the earlier expectations.", "Europe, one is timing, one is the currency head win, the tax rate is the other thing that has changed. I will say and this is a reason we\u2019ve provided detail in our scripted comments that when we look at some of the analyst models that are out there that it does seem as if in many cases the average share count is getting understated for 2016. I think that\u2019s something to look at.", "Again, we\u2019ve provided on this call very specific guidance on what we\u2019re expecting to see in the average share account remembering that we\u2019ve put the share repurchase program on hold. We\u2019re going to be issuing another 32 million shares to consummate the transaction and then beyond that we\u2019re going to continue to see an increase, you know, until such time that we put the share repurchase program back in place and in average shares associated with the employee equity incentive program.", "David R. Lewis", "Okay and then maybe just - may be a quick question on \u201815 guidance for a second. I know there was currency tailwinds and some other obsolescence and the inventory headwinds, but it does seem like there was 70 bips of underlying margin improvement and that particular margin for me, Jim, in the first quarter; dinner, why would that not help to offset some of the incremental Fx and tax pressures in \u201815? It looks like that would have, you know, maybe offset at least half the $0.10 or $0.15 incremental \u201815 headwind.", "James T. Crines", "Well, again, it\u2019s the $80 million of currency headwind in the quarter and that\u2019s high margin revenue. So, while the hedging program is effective and, at least, partially offsetting the effect of that, it just doesn\u2019t fully offset it, and some of this, as well, has to do with where, you know, what\u2019s happening. Where there is very significant currency headwinds, for example, is in some of the emerging markets and in those markets while we do hedge, we don\u2019t hedge to the same level because the cost of hedging is so expensive with respect to those currencies.", "David R. Lewis", "Okay but should the underlying margin performance, you know, if there was underlying improvement in the first quarter, should we expect that improvement to sustain itself throughout the remainder of the year or not?", "James T. Crines", "Yes. Now, we\u2019ll continue to see that through the remainder of that is reflected in the updated guidance that we provided.", "David R. Lewis", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "James T. Crines", "Sure.", "David C. Dvorak", "Julie, we have time for one additional question.", "Operator", "Okay. Thank you. The last question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.", "Craig W. Bijou", "Hi guys. It\u2019s actually Craig on for Larry. Thanks for squeezing us in.", "David C. Dvorak", "Sure.", "Craig W. Bijou", "I just wanted to quickly ask about EPS growth beyond 2016, I know you provided guidance of mid-teens or higher in 2016 and then just wanted to know for the combined company what should we expect from EPS growth?", "James T. Crines", "I'll just reference the longer term, what we have talked about in the past and continue to focus to put together our longer term strategic plans and that is to drive in the range of 8% to 10%growth in adjusted earnings per share over the long-term. Obviously with the combination and now the updated guidance that we provided on synergies in the near-term that growth rate is going to be higher but long-term as I said you know we've put together our five year plans, strategic plans, the management team is going t0o be focusing on what it need to do to drive that earnings growth in a range of 8% to 10%.", "Craig W. Bijou", "Okay thanks and then just as a follow-up the tax rate, you mentioned the tax rate increasing in 2016 and just want to see where that goes in 2017 and beyond. Can you get back down to what your original thoughts were on the combined tax rate?", "James T. Crines", "That\u2019s a very good question, there are a couple of things that we - there is a lot of tax planning that is already underway with respect to the combined - the anticipated closing of the transaction. And I will tell you that that has been more focused on what the combined enterprise can do to get access to the cash that\u2019s going to be accumulating offshore and there are some things that we will be able to do that will enable us to access quite a bit of cash that\u2019s going to be accumulating offshore something in the range of $3 billion to $4 billion overtime.", "And that obviously is going to provide the management team with some opportunity to do some things that could potentially drive leverage on the bottom-line including getting ahead of share repurchase program back in play at some point accelerating the debt repayments during the leverage ratio inline with something that is more inline with what you would expect to see for an investment grade credit.", "And then we will be pivoting to once the deal is closed some tax planning initiative that will focus on what the enterprise can do to drive down the effective tax rate overtime. We know that that\u2019s going to involve among other things moving manufacturing source in some cases sourcing more of the demand that\u2019s offshore from our offshore manufacturing facilities and do believe that that\u2019s going to provide opportunity to bring that effective tax rate down.", "Craig W. Bijou", "Is that something that\u2019s going to happen immediately after close? Can you start seeing the benefit?", "James T. Crines", "Well the planning will certainly happen immediately, but the steps that it will take to actually realize the benefit will take more time, because particularly when you are talking about changing sourcing within our own network, we certainly have control of that but that takes time, those manufacturing transfers take time and then it take time to show up in the P&L to the extent that that inventory - the tax benefit will be recognized as inventory that\u2019s getting sourced from new locations is getting so.", "James T. Crines", "Okay. Thanks for taking the questions.", "David C. Dvorak", "I would like to thank everyone for joining the call today and for your continued interest and support for Zimmer. We look forward to speaking to you on our second quarter conference call, which is scheduled for 8:00 AM on July 30, 2015. With that, I'll turn the call back to you, Julie.", "Operator", "Thank you again for participating in today's conference call.

I would like to turn the call over to Bob Marshall, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Marshall, you may begin your call.", "Bob Marshall", "Thank you, Ben. Good morning, and welcome to Zimmer Biomet's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference call. I'm here with our CEO, David Dvorak; our CFO, Dan Florin; and Jim Crines, Retiring Executive Vice President and CFO. This morning we'll be discussing the recently announced closure of our combination with Biomet. We will also briefly cover Zimmer's second quarter 2015 financial results.", "Additionally, the company has posted a slide presentation highlighting reported changes and selected combined historical financials on our Investor Relations website.", "Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements, due to variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.", "Also, the discussion on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, are included within the earnings release, or found on our website at investor.zimmerbiomet.com.", "With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jim.", "Jim Crines", "Thank you, Bob. I will make some brief remarks on second quarter results, and then turn the call over to David and Dan.", "With respect to our sales commentary for the Zimmer legacy product categories, I will provide quarter over prior year quarter changes, absent acquired Biomet revenue and adjusted to reflect fewer selling days for certain international markets in the current year quarter. Pro forma comparisons to the prior year quarter can be found on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website.", "Turning now to our results. Zimmer experienced a price decline of 2% in the quarter, which is consistent with our expectations coming into the year. Total revenues for the second quarter were $1.168 billion, a 5.7% constant currency increase, compared to the second quarter of 2014.", "Net currency impact for the quarter decreased revenues by 7% or $83 million. Acquired revenue from the Biomet transaction contributed 5% or $60 million in the quarter. Therefore Zimmer standalone sales increased 0.7% or 1.2% on a like-billing day basis in the quarter.", "During the quarter, excluding acquired revenue and on a billing day adjusted basis, the company grew Knees at 2.7%; Hips and Extremities each decreased 0.6%; Dental revenues grew 0.7%; Trauma as well as Surgical and other sales were flat; and Spine sales increased 5%.", "Geographic sales also absent acquired Biomet revenue and on a billing day adjusted basis were as follows. Americas, plus 0.5%; Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 1% and Asia-Pacific increased 3.7%.", "Our adjusted gross profit margin was 76.4% for the quarter. A favorable geographic segment mix of revenues, together with foreign currency hedge gains and favorable year-over-year comparisons with regard to manufacturing variances, were partially offset by the impact of negative price.", "The company's R&D expense compared to the prior year increased 7.1% or $3.4 million on a reported basis to 4.4% of net sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $445.1 million in the second quarter, and at 38.1% of sales were 120 basis points above the prior year.", "During the quarter, the company reported certain non-recurring pre-tax expenses, including $465 million of charges relating to the Biomet merger and $90 million of special items and certain claims.", "Additionally, pre-tax amortization expense in the quarter was $34.9 million. Adjusted second quarter 2015 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these charges. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to $395.3 million. At 33.8%, our adjusted operating profit-to-sales ratio was 160 basis points higher than the prior year second quarter. This marks the eighth quarter in a row with operating margin improvement.", "Adjusted net interest expense for the quarter amounted to $18.7 million, which was unfavorable when compared to the prior year quarter due to the inclusion of acquisition-related debt and adjusted earnings, following the Biomet merger. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.9% and was 20 basis points favorable, when compared to prior year.", "Adjusted net earnings were $278.7 million for the second quarter, an increase of 2.8% compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 0.6% to $1.59 on a 175.6 million average outstanding diluted shares.", "The company recorded a loss per share of $0.91 on a GAAP or reported-basis for the quarter. The loss is due principally to expenses incurred during the quarter in connection with the Biomet merger. This compares to the prior year second quarter reported EPS of $1.03.", "Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $186.8 million, a decrease of 26.5% from $254.1 million in the second quarter of 2014. Cash outflows in the second quarter related to the merger transaction amounted to $108 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for the second quarter amounted to $99.6 million.", "Free cash flow in the second quarter was $114.8 million; $44.7 million lower than the second quarter of 2014. We define free cash flow as operating cash flow less cash outlays for instruments and property, plant and equipments. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $72 million, including $41.6 million for instruments and $30.4 million for property, plant and equipment.", "As expected, as of June 30, our gross debt was $12.05 billion or 4.1x our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA and our net leverage ratio including cash on hand and short-term investments was 3.5x adjusted trailing 12-month EBITDA.", "As this is my final investor call, I just want to say that it has been a pleasure to work with all of you, and be part of the dedicated and highly talented team of people here at the company for the last 15 years. As I step out of this role, I look forward with excitement at the value creation opportunities this new team will be pursuing with the same tenacity that drove past accomplishments at both companies.", "David, I'll now turn the call over to you.", "David Dvorak", "Well, thanks for your many contributions to the company over the years, Jim. This morning, I'll focus my comments on some of the key value creation opportunities presented by our landmark combination with Biomet.", "In short, the synergies inherent in this merger will accelerate the execution of our primary commercial and innovation growth strategies, while at the same time enabling the company to generate extremely attractive financial results.", "By virtue of possessing a significantly broadened and truly comprehensive portfolio of innovative musculoskeletal solutions, Zimmer Biomet is in an excellent position to accelerate top line growth over the course of our global integration, principally through a host of cross selling opportunities between our two legacy portfolios. Our integration teams have already achieved key milestones in support of these commercial opportunities, including the implementation of critical sales infrastructure and the completion of initial product trainings, which have supported our ability to begin deploying specialized commercial teams in key product categories and geographies.", "We expect to substantially complete our commercial integration by the end of this year, including the appointment of just over 2,000 specialized sales representatives concentrating in non-large joint sales opportunities, a number that we aim to further expand significantly throughout this decade.", "Our vision is to build the most highly specialized and effective musculoskeletal commercial team in the industry. Consistent with that goal, we selected sales leaders with proven track records and designed compensation plans that reward growth. We expect to begin realizing the benefits of our integrated sales channel, as well as these commercial opportunities in the form of sequentially accelerating revenue growth, as we exit 2015 and progress through 2016.", "As a leader in the nearly $50 billion musculoskeletal industry, Zimmer Biomet's portfolio of solutions offers unparalleled anatomical coverage, as well as reach across the full continuum of care from minimally-invasive and biologic joint preservation technologies, to partial, total, revision and salvage arthroplasty systems.", "I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to highlight a number of the complementary portfolio offerings that our sales organization will be aggressively leveraging. Our market-leading Knee business continues to be led by Persona, the personalized knee system, and our clinically trusted Vanguard and NexGen knee systems. In addition, our impressive knee lineup includes the Vanguard Select and Vanguard 360 revision system.", "Finally, our portfolio is further differentiated by our bicruciate preserving arthroplasty options, including the clinically-proven Oxford Partial Knee, and our new Vanguard XP Total Knee System.", "In Hips, our offerings address the full-range of patient anatomy and surgical philosophies. Our Taperloc Complete Microplasty stem and Avenir Hip System for example, meet the rising demand for minimally invasive techniques that incorporate the anterior supine surgical approach.", "Our portfolio is also complemented by the Arcos Femoral Revision System, and our multi-bearing premium cup options featuring the G7 and Continuum Acetabular Systems.", "Within our newly formed SET product category, we see our Sports Medicine business as a particularly attractive source of quick wins across our sales channel. Joining our early intervention Gel-One and Subchondroplasty treatments, the JuggerKnot Soft Anchor System marks our expansion into this fast growing market.", "We're bullish on the union of our complementary extremities portfolios, highlighted by the cross-selling opportunities represented by the comprehensive Total Shoulder System, which commands a wide clinical audience in a rapidly growing market and the Nexel Total Elbow.", "Our growth prospects in the Foot and Ankle category are also extremely promising, including the Trabecular Metal Total Ankle, the Phoenix Ankle Arthrodesis Nail system, and the A.L.P.S. Total Foot Plating System. Backed by a broad portfolio of solutions, we'll bring heightened focus to this attractive market.", "For our focused trauma sales teams, immediate opportunities include the ePAK Single-Use Delivery System, featuring the DVR Crosslock Distal Radius Plate, as well as the Cable-Ready Cable Grip System.", "Our Surgical business also stands to benefit from the enhanced focus and sales force specialization we're leveraging to drive our broadened clinical portfolio. Zimmer Biomet also positions a diversified dental business offering critical scale to address the faster growing value-market segment with our line of PI branded offerings, in addition to our range of Encode custom abutments and a market-leading regenerative portfolio.", "Turning to our Spine category. As a combined company, we're building on a successful cadence of commercial releases from 2014. This global business offers a differentiated pipeline and a comprehensive portfolio that address minimally invasive procedures with our PathFinder NXT Pedicle Screw System, as well as lateral access surgeries with the Timberline Lateral Fusion System.", "Finally, we're very excited about our innovative and rapidly expanding craniomaxillofacial and thoracic businesses, as well as our opportunities to benefit from sales channel and expertise within the bone healing business. In support of our longer term growth targets, we\u2019ll use our scale to enhance the differentiation of our innovation pipeline and to accelerate the pace of our future commercial introductions.", "With research and development resources that are nearly 80% greater than our standalone capability, we will aggressively pursue innovations to address unmet needs and create new market adjacencies to expand our leadership in musculoskeletal healthcare.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Dan, who will this continue this discussion in greater detail, as well as review our guidance. Dan?", "Dan Florin", "Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here with you today. I'm looking forward to serving our new company in the role of Chief Financial Officer and building upon the successes achieved by my predecessor, Jim Crines. First of all, I want to thank Jim for all of his support during this transition period, and I wish him the very best in his future endeavors.", "Today, I'm going to walk you through a brief summary of the synergies and accretions associated with our merger, followed by my comments on the prevailing market and pricing conditions and our 2015 guidance.", "As incoming CFO, I'm fully committed to maintaining the value creation principles, which have made Zimmer and Biomet leaders in musculoskeletal healthcare and which have formed the pillars to this deal namely, growth through innovation and outstanding service, operational excellence and prudent capital deployment.", "Accelerating our top line growth, as David has outlined, in combination with execution on our cost synergies and operational excellence plans will result in leveraged earnings growth and increase cash flows to both reinvest in growth initiatives and return capital to stockholders.", "Our fully staffed integration management teams are now hard at work, driving a disciplined global plan encompassing over 400 distinct projects across our commercial, functional and business units, with more than 7,000 relevant process milestones. Our new management team has significant merger integration experience, and we are leveraging many of the operating disciplines, playbooks and governance structures from Zimmer's successful acquisition of Centerpulse.", "Turning now to deal synergies. We continue to project net annual pre-tax operating earnings synergies of $135 million in the first year and $350 million by year three, post close. Recall that these net synergies are comprised of cost savings, somewhat offset by the EBIT impact of the product line divestitures and estimated revenue dis-synergies net of cross-selling benefits.", "We expect to realize the bulk of the cost synergies through the elimination of SG&A redundancies, as well as strategic sourcing and shared services initiatives, optimization of our manufacturing and distribution network and deployment of lean principles across the enterprise. Initial savings will be heavily weighted to the SG&A line on the P&L.", "We continue to expect adjusted earnings per share accretion in the range of $0.95 to $1.05 over the first 12 months post-closing, with approximately one-third of this number to be realized in 2015.", "As Bob noted at the beginning of the call, we have posted a presentation on our Investor Relations website that provides an explanation of our reporting changes, as well as selected combined pro forma historical sales results and financials. Within those schedules, we\u2019ve provided a view of the past six quarters of constant currency revenue growth, based on our new product categories and geographic segments, which will be utilized beginning with our third quarter 2015 results.", "We've also included a reconciliation of Zimmer Biomet combined net sales to combined net sales to divestitures that were completed in order to finalize our merger.", "Lastly, we\u2019ve provided a combined historical earnings statement from net sales to adjusted EBIT, including the adjusted margin analysis through the first quarter of 2015. We hope you find the pro forma information useful for your modeling.", "As you update your models, you'll note that there is a new sales category called SET, comprised of Surgical, Sports Medicine, Extremities, Foot & Ankle and Trauma with joint preservation technologies included in Sports Medicine.", "This product category comprises approximately $12 billion of the nearly $50 billion musculoskeletal market and is estimated to grow in the mid-single-digit range over the next few years.", "With the combination, the SET category now represents approximately 20% of our revenue base, and we're investing in growth drivers such as specialized sales forces and innovative products that compete aggressively in this space.", "As you'll see in the pro forma revenue schedules, for the first three quarters of 2014, Zimmer Biomet's combined quarterly revenue growth within the 3% to nearly 5% range, which we believe reflects at-or-above market performance during this period.", "Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continuing into 2015, combined growth rates began to decelerate to the 2% to 3% range, and eventually flat performance in Q2. We believe this reflects an absence of investment and offensive measures by our sales channels during the pendency period of the merger closing.", "With the merger now closed and our channel integration plans being executed, coupled with the strong portfolio and cross-sell opportunities that David outlined, we are optimistic that we will get back to at-or-above market growth rates as we progress through 2016.", "Turning to market and pricing conditions. We have seen ongoing but stable price pressure for the last several quarters. We believe the growth outlook for the global Knee and Hip markets will remain consistent throughout 2015 in the low-single-digit range. Procedural demand in our view, continues to be driven primarily by favorable demographics and growing utilization of musculoskeletal healthcare in emerging markets and under-penetrated developed markets.", "Moving now to our guidance. We are reaffirming our full-year 2015 pro forma revenue guidance of a constant currency growth rate of between 1.5% and 2%. As noted, the pro forma adjustments reflect the inclusion of Biomet revenues and the removal of revenue from the divested product lines for the comparable post-merger closing period in 2014. The impact from currency for the full-year is projected to decrease revenues by approximately 6%. Therefore reported revenue should be in a range of minus 4% to minus 4.5%, which in dollar terms is between $6.015 billion and $6.05 billion.", "We are also updating our full-year 2015 adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $6.65 to $6.80. Previously we had estimated full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $6.60 and $6.80.", "It is important to note that the fully diluted average share count that should be used for the full-year diluted EPS calculation is estimated at 190.5 million shares, which includes shares issued to complete the transaction and does not assume any share repurchases.", "I'll now provide some details on guidance for the second half of 2015. We expect constant currency pro forma revenue growth on a day-rate basis to be between 1% and 2%.", "On an adjusted basis for the second half of 2015, we expect our gross margin to be in the range of 75% to 75.5%. We intend for our research and development expense to be in a range of 4.5% to 5% of sales. SG&A expense should be in a range of 38.5% to 39%. And adjusted net interest expense is expected to be $185 million.", "The adjusted effective tax rate is estimated to be between 26.5% and 27%. The fully diluted share count for the second half is approximately 206.5 million shares. Adjusted diluted earnings per share would be in a range of $3.45 and $3.60. Combining this range with the first half performance and applying the full-year diluted share-count of 190.5 million shares, you arrive at our full-year guidance of $6.65 to $6.80.", "For modeling purposes, please remember to reflect the expense to sales ratios and corresponding margins to account for the seasonality that occurs between the third and fourth quarters. Third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be in a range of $1.52 and $1.57.", "Finally, I want to provide a few comments on full-year cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the year is expected to be between $650 million and $700 million, which includes $430 million of costs related to the merger transaction and approximately $250 million of costs to realized synergies. We expect to spend approximately $500 million on instruments and property, plant and equipment in 2015, inclusive of approximately $60 million of integration-related items.", "Free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less cash outlays for instruments and PP&E is estimated to be between $150 million and $200 million.", "Please note that our guidance does not include any impact from potential business development activities or other unforeseen events.", "David, I'll now turn the call back over to you.", "David Dvorak", "Thanks Dan. Zimmer Biomet now stands as one global leader. And with our increased scale in musculoskeletal diversification, we're able to anticipate and address the needs of the evolving global healthcare landscape. Our strategic vision continues to focus on delivering a compelling value proposition for patients, healthcare providers and our stockholders.", "And now, I'd like to ask Vince to begin the Q&A portion of our call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Analysts are allowed to ask one question and one follow-up question. One moment please for our first question. And our first question is from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Thank you very much for taking my question. Since you're in the early stages of the integration, could you please walk us through a little bit of what you're experiencing that will help you or give you confidence that your growth rate will reaccelerate as we enter 2016?", "David Dvorak", "Sure, Joanne. I think that the advantage that we\u2019ve had of the long pendency period was we were able to develop extremely detailed methodical plans. And so when day one rolled around, our teams were extraordinarily well prepared, and that includes the plans that Dan outlined with respect to the different work streams and milestones that we're tracking. So we have a lot of details and capability to track and respond to anything that was not embedded in the plans. But with respect to the acceleration opportunities, the cross-sell is one of our primary areas of focus, and that opportunity starts with putting the right sales talent in place.", "I would tell you that that was a very pleasant surprise as we went through the experiencing of drawing out the best from both organizations. We have extraordinarily talented commercial leaders that had been appointed. And those individuals are putting their management teams and then sales rep appointments together. All of that work is expected to be substantially complete by the end of this year, and we're well on our way.", "Also we\u2019ve been able to put in place all of the infrastructure necessary to facilitate the cross-sell opportunities. We had some opportunities to pre-build inventory in key product categories, to pre-train sales reps in key product categories, and so this offense is starting to ramp up. Clearly, that takes some time for that pipeline to rebuild and the momentum will be restored. And we're expecting to see terrific progress through the balance of the year that's going to set us up nicely for 2016 to get after those opportunities.", "Joanne Wuensch", "And as my follow-up before I get to that, first I wanted to say thank you, Jim. It's been a pleasure to work with you. But the second question is, your guidance you called out, it does not include any potential business development. Should we think of you now that the deal has closed, as still looking or in a pause mode until you fully incorporate it? Thank you.", "Jim Crines", "Let me just say thanks, Joanne. As I said, I very much appreciate working with you and the rest of the analyst community, but I'll let Dan respond to the question on capital deployment.", "Dan Florin", "Great. Thanks Joanne for the question. Certainly we continued to be very active evaluating business development activities. We have a terrific business development organization, always looking for opportunities to drive growth. And we feel having leverage of about 4x that Jim described is not an impediment to that. We'll continue to be disciplined in terms of capital allocation. Zimmer has an excellent track record of being disciplined, and will continue to do so as we progress.", "But we'll continue to look for tuck-in opportunities, M& A activities. We believe strongly the cash flow generation of the combined enterprise, provides us the opportunity to do that, while we look to delever the balance sheet, grow EBITDA and reinvest in growth initiatives organically as well.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.", "Bob Hopkins", "Thanks, and good morning, and also good luck to Jim in your future endeavors. So thanks for taking the questions. I've got just two. I want to focus on revenues. Obviously one of the reasons why the stock has lagged a little bit is concern about revenue growth. So my first question is, can you talk a little bit about why you had to lower revenue growth guidance at the time of the deal close? And do you think that the level of dis-synergies that you originally thought about and talked about might now be higher than you originally thought? That's my first question. Thank you.", "David Dvorak", "Sure. Bob, I think that it was clear that the pendency period was more extended than we originally anticipated. And naturally with the lack of clarity during that prolonged period of 14 months, you're going to lose some of that offensive momentum. All of that is very addressable. And the plans that we have in place with the appointments of the leadership, as I said, the infrastructural implementation and cascading that through the field organization puts us in a great place to restore that momentum as we work through the balance of the year.", "So I think it's more just the extended pendency period rather than anything at all fundamental changing. That's very temporary in the scheme of the underlying strategy for this combination, and we're quite confident that that's going to get addressed, so nothing fundamental whatsoever has changed by virtue of that.", "Bob Hopkins", "So your thoughts on dis-synergies are not different than they were originally?", "David Dvorak", "Not at all.", "Bob Hopkins", "Okay. And then secondly, I just wanted to ask you to try to be very clear. I want to be clear about what you\u2019re saying about 2016. So I think you said that you expect accelerating growth over the course of the year, but when do you think you can get back to market levels of revenue growth? And what specifically will drive the improved growth outlook as you look into 2016, especially when you consider things like U.S, knees right now still struggling in the negative 3% to 4% territories? I just want to be as specific as we can about what the drivers are in 2016 that will improve growth?", "David Dvorak", "Well, just to clarify, to start with Knees are at-or-slightly above market on the legacy Zimmer side. I think that holds true for the legacy Biomet side also. The Hip category requires some attention, but I think with the complementary aspects of the portfolios, we\u2019re going to be able to bring that attention to it and put that on a better course, Bob. But if you think about the dynamics that are going to go into what we generate by way of top line growth, you have the circumstances that you described coming into the closing, the opportunities that I'm outlining this morning to reaccelerate the top line growth and these are businesses that going back just to the point of announcement through the majority of 2014 together were generating 3% to 5% growth. And so that quite clearly is an opportunity for these businesses.", "And that's on a standalone basis. So you put these portfolios together, pick the best of the best in sales leaders, train up the sales reps for those opportunities, leverage the relationships that exist at the surgeon level for cross-selling and that's going to be extraordinarily powerful. And that's not a temporary synergy by virtue of the combination. That's going to be a sustainable synergy.", "And we'll talk a little bit more I suspect, before we're done with the Q&A about the product portfolio and the go-forward pipeline opportunities. So if you look at the restoration of that momentum, as I said, speed is important but getting it right in the field integration, the plans that we have allow us to do both.", "By the end of this year, we're going to have the right sales team set up and at a full clip going into 2016. And so then what has to happen is that momentum has to be restored and the cross-sell opportunities have to be ramping up to a point where they're offsetting any of the natural fallout as far as dis-synergies go on the top line. That's going to occur sequentially. We\u2019re going to see improvement throughout 2016.", "And so the comment that I would make to you by a way of answer is, tough at this point to pinpoint the particular month, but you\u2019re going to see sequential improvement throughout 2016. And we're confident that we're going to get back to or even above market growth rates as the year progresses.", "Bob Hopkins", "Great. Thank you.", "David Dvorak", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Mike Weinstein", "Good morning, and thanks for taking the question guys. And Jim, obviously we've known each other a long time, so it's been fantastic working with you. I do want to start just on the combination of the sales organizations. And David, we had talked prior to the close about getting some better visibility on your plans for combining the distributors and sales reps and what that might start to look like. So can you, A, start to maybe talk a bit about that today in terms of where you are in that process? And B, can you talk about retention. Have you lost any notable distributors in the U.S. or what your rep retention looks like? And then C, what you're doing financially to try and get people to stay? Thanks.", "David Dvorak", "Sure, Mike. To start with an overview of the structure, this is an organization that will be led by the best of the best. If one looks at the legacy leaders across the globe, I think a lot of times these discussions end up becoming focused immediately on United States market, but across the globe, we're selecting the best territory managers, the best country managers, the best sales managers supporting those level leaders.", "And then as we said from the beginning retaining the sales rep positions. This is a really powerful organization in the thousands of numbers, and numbers at the sales rep level and it provides us with an extraordinary opportunity to develop more specialized sales forces in the non-large joint areas, which is something that we'll begin implementing through this integration process and continue to grow in the years to come. So we\u2019re well on our way, Mike.", "Those leadership positions obviously at the executive level and the next couple of levels down within the organization were all appointed pre-close and well before pre-close. So they were able to put their plans together next level down. And all of those execution plans are cascading down to the rep level as we speak. As I said, for the amount of work to be done and the size of that channel to do that in the coming several months and be locked down going in 2016 is a big task, but it's the right priority for the organization.", "And with those appointments is going to come certainty and clarity, so that people are going to be very offensive minded and began to start to take advantage of the cross-sell opportunities that exists, both at the product and at the surgeon level.", "The compensation opportunities are terrific. There isn't a better bag in the industry. And irrespective of product category area of focus, these sales reps are going to have wonderful opportunities, not only with the product category bag that exists at this point, but the pipeline that exists, and then the opportunities for greater differentiation on the R&D side, because the scale that we have across the entire portfolio. So people are excited about it. The tone is very positive.", "I would also tell you that these are leaders that have, in many cases, 10, 20, 30 years of experience. So these transitions are not new to them. They have a lot of experience in just managing the channel.", "I'd also tell you, Mike, that when you look at these leaders that are chosen on average in the United States for example, the selected leaders have a compounded annual growth rate that's hundreds of basis points above those that are not selected at that level of the organization. And so this is the best of the best. They know how to put these organizations together and run that offense, and we're going to be hitting our stride in short order.", "Mike Weinstein", "So let me circle back to David. So can you just tell us the picture you're setting first off, is one where you\u2019re consolidating sales management and then leaving the reps and distributors in place. Can you talk about retention at this point and what that looks like, and what you expect that to look like, and how long you're financial incentivizing people to stick around, so we can get a sense of kind of what the window of risk looks like?", "David Dvorak", "Yes, I think that the retention has been excellent. These attrition rates have been quite consistent with historic levels. It may tick up single-digit percentage points as we go through this process, and this is what we would expect to continue to see, but I don't it going beyond that. And the leadership appointments down to the management level in the field will be taking place very early on, and in many instances, have already been accomplished in different territories and will be done at the sales rep level as these months progress. So I don't anticipate any significant uptick in attrition rates, Mike.", "Mike Weinstein", "Okay. Thank you, David. I'll let some others jump in.", "David Dvorak", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, this is actually Young Li [ph] in for Matt Taylor. Thanks for taking our questions. The first question is, I guess, actually maybe on M&A. It's a question on robotics.", "So one of your competitors reported pretty good robot sales this quarter and there is interest in medical robots among other companies in med tech. Just wondering if you can talk about your level of interest in this area?", "David Dvorak", "Well, we're very interested in the underlying premise to those technologies and we\u2019ve been added for a long time with both internal/external development efforts in that regard.", "Our portfolio of patient-specific instruments including legacy Biomet Signature technology, preoperative planning systems and templating systems, our iASSIST technology, our eLIBRA technology are all consistent with the goal of making these procedures as reproducible and heightening the outcomes in a very cost effective way. That's been the mission that we've been on for many years and we've made terrific progress and feel good about where our programs are going to take us in that regard.", "To the extent that technologies can achieve those same objectives, preferably that are smaller, faster, cheaper, preferably ones that integrate into the natural workflow for the surgeon and drive OR efficiencies as opposed to affecting some of those key areas in a negative way, then we'd be interested in any other technologies. And so, we're going to continue to be very open-minded, but we like the portfolio of technologies that we've been developing, and what we have underway to continue to progress in that area.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, thanks. And regarding the CMS proposal to bundle hip and knee reimbursements, it's been talked about a lot before, but can you just remind us what your expectations are in terms of impact on price and if you're working with payors to maybe mitigate some of that impact?", "David Dvorak", "I don't see that is having any significant impact on price. I think that the pricing environment that we\u2019ve been operating in has all of the drivers embedded in it that are the underlying reasons for that proposal. I think that the proposal in many ways, as well as the delivery modifications that are embedded within the ACA in general are consistent with what we all have to be mindful of.", "Again, we're trying to develop deeper partnerships with our customers, the surgeons and providers to bring about a better patient outcome in a cost efficient way, and that more expansive end-to-end definition that's embedded within that proposal is the right concept. There are elements of that proposal that should be modified.", "We ought to make sure that we're not stinting healthcare, especially when the delivery of healthcare and access, especially when you look at the measurement period on the back end of 90 days. These are procedures that are often times appropriately measured in years as far as success rates. And so we should be careful about how we set those proof [ph] programs up, but the concept of ensuring that the cure is coordinated in a patient-centric way and is mindful of the overall cost is an appropriate one from our perspectives.", "The innovations that we have underway and the opportunities that we have with our field service organizations to contribute positively to that endeavor are immense, and it's a big part of our strategy going forward. So I think it's in alignment with how we ought to be thinking about improving patient care in general, and I don't see it having any impact of significance on the pricing environment", "Unidentified Analyst", "Very great. That's very helpful. Thank you.", "David Dvorak", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "David Lewis", "Good morning. Just one historical question for Dave or Dan. I guess, the stated objective when you did the deal for the balance sheet was debt repayment, and now we have a situation where what I'm hearing is your conviction in long-term deal accretion is actually higher post-initial announcement. Dave, you mentioned this morning that the dis-synergy investments were unchanged, yet obviously as you know, the stock is lower. So I guess the question is for Dan or for David. Why does aggressive share repurchase now not make more sense than aggressive debt repayment?", "Dan Florin", "David, this is Dan. As we progress through the rest of 2015 and continue to gain traction on integration and confidence in the execution of that integration, which we do have full confidence in, we'll continue to evaluate capital deployment. So certainly to drive the integration and the synergies, we need to spend some cash to do that. There is a nice return on that investment.", "As per my earlier comments, you look back at a track record of Zimmer in terms of capital allocation. It's a terrific track record, returning nearly 70% of free cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.", "So going forward, we're focused on executing the synergy program, accelerating the top line growth, driving improvements in our free cash flow yields back to historical levels. We see that type of opportunity.", "With that enhanced cash flow generation, we'll continue to look at what makes sense on a go-forward basis. So we'll go through a detailed operating plan for 2016, look at cash needs and weigh those trade-offs. So it's certainly something that we'll continue to evaluate. We'll also over time look at a deliberate attempt to delever the balance sheet.", "We have been able through this inter-company loan transaction that the tax team executed has opened up that pipeline to OUS cash, so that's been a critical initiative that's behind us. The access to that cash begins late this year. So at that point in time, we'll have cash available to make those decisions.", "And then out over time, as we build free cash flow, have access to that OUS cash, I think that gives us a lot of flexibility to look at both organic growth capital, if you will, external opportunities and then return of capital to stockholders.", "David Lewis", "Okay. That's very helpful, Dan. I guess the other second question I have is just revenue trend as you described have obviously lagged, but margins have trended much better. So where are you seeing primary success that's driving that underlying performance? And as you go through the integration, how confident are you that we see a continuation of these up margin trends? Thank you.", "Dan Florin", "Sure. Certainly as we\u2019ve progressed through the integration plans and we start to realize those synergies, keep in mind there will be a ramp up of those synergies over time. As you see in our second quarter performance, the gross margin rate is benefiting from the gains on the foreign exchange contracts. And keep in mind that as we bring Biomet into the fold and start layering the Biomet cash flows into the Zimmer hedging program, that will take time to gain traction.", "So in the back half of 2015, while the hedge contracts will continue to contribute in a relatively consistent basis from a dollar standpoint as we bring the Biomet revenues into that as a percentage of sales, the contribution of the FX gains will be lower. So that does put some pressure, if you will, on the second half gross margin rate relative to the first half and that's embedded in the guidance that I just provided.", "But the underlying ability to drive operating margin improvement is real by virtue of the synergy plans that we have. And importantly, the mix benefits of premium technologies on the Biomet side as we continue to drive growth there. So the cross-sell opportunities - a number of those cross-sell opportunities are focused in the premium technologies that the Biomet portfolio brings to bear day one.", "David Lewis", "Thank you very much.", "Dan Florin", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.", "Craig Bijou", "Hi guys, it's actually Craig on for Larry. Thanks for taking the questions. I have a couple of questions on EPS, and just starting with 2016 EPS. I think on the last call, you mentioned that we could see 15% to 20% growth on 2015 EPS. So firstly, are you still comfortable with that range? And second, is the accelerating top line growth, could that potentially lead to upside to 2016 EPS growth?", "Dan Florin", "Craig, this is Dan. Certainly based upon everything that I\u2019ve seen and analyzed to-date, including the details of our synergy and integration program, I am confident that we can deliver earnings per share within that range, a range of $6.65 to $6.80. I'm confident in that regard.", "With respect to the top line, the opportunities that David has outlined, in terms of the acceleration of growth through 2016, is embedded within that assumption. So yes, at this point in time, we\u2019re confident in the ability to deliver that EPS growth in 2016.", "Craig Bijou", "Okay, thanks. And then just as a quick follow-up. When you think about EPS growth beyond 2016, I know in the last call, I think Jim mentioned that the 8% to 10% management goal for EPS growth. And I wanted to ask looking out in 2017, 2018 are the synergy - I guess, are the synergies necessary to hit that 8% to 10% growth, or could the synergies from the deal be incremental to the 8% to 10%?", "Dan Florin", "Sure. So later this year - first with respect to 2016, we'll be providing official guidance in January for 2016. So our stated goal of confidence in that EPS growth is what we're shooting for, our operating plan will be geared towards the achievement of that. And then in January, we'll give you the official guidance for 2006 team. At the same time, in the upcoming months, the new management team will be going through the strategic planning process looking out beyond 2016.", "And certainly as we think about EPS opportunity at the combined enterprise of the 8% to 10% type range, we feel confident based on what we know right now of the combined portfolio that we can deliver in that range. And as we go through the strategic planning process, we'll look for opportunities to exceed that.", "But at this point in time, I'd say we're comfortable in that range. And as we talked about 2016 guidance in January, we can give you an update on our thinking longer term.", "Craig Bijou", "Great. Thanks for taking the questions.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "David Roman", "Thank you, and good morning, everybody. I know there aren\u2019t a lot of questions on the deal, so I was hoping to ask a couple of questions on the underlying businesses. Maybe you could, David or Dan, give us a little bit more color on what's going on in both the Trauma and Dental businesses? And maybe Trauma and Extremities more specifically, given that those are end-markets that look to be growing quite a bit faster than the growth you're generating right now, and any factors that maybe influencing the trends in your business and any product launches that could be drivers of an uptick on a go-forward basis?", "David Dvorak", "Sure. I think that the Trauma business - I think we have significant opportunities in that regard, David. When you look at the complementary aspects of that portfolio, we immediately gravitate towards a couple of the key areas. The Distal Radius product category is one that we have not had much of a presence in on the Zimmer side historically. The product offering is first rate on the Biomet side. The Cable-Ready System is strong on the Zimmer side. That's a big cross-sell opportunity into that pipeline.", "Also, sales force specialization is going to be meaningful. We've got a channel that historically has been more oriented toward the large joint side of the business and we're going to be breaking out sales rep specialization to bring greater emphasis. So you've got more emphasis at the sales rep level, a more comprehensive portfolio that puts us in a position to compete very effectively in level-1 level trauma centers, where we haven't had as much of a presence [Technical Difficulty], and that's going to add up to a big opportunity to expand our market share.", "So that's a good example of what this deal brings into these smaller business categories for us where we had subscale businesses, and now are sort of in a sweet spot where we have critical mass, a broad portfolio are in a very competitive position and are very confident that we're going to be in a share gain mode.", "And I would say the same thing about Dental. You're essentially doubling the size of those product categories by virtue of this combination. And so our capability to do well at the premium, as well as the value level within the dental market across the globe is greatly enhanced by this combination. And then you add some other areas including the legacy Zimmer dental regenerative portfolio, which is an industry-leading portfolio that the legacy Biomet reps are going to be able to sell into.", "So great opportunities in both, and I think you're going to start to see some of the benefits as we progress through 2016 in those categories.", "David Roman", "That's helpful, thank you. Then maybe a follow-up on one of your prepared comments. I believe in your prepared remarks you said that the opportunity to sort of invest in innovation would increase by about 70%. That sounds like just adding the Biomet R&D to the existing base Zimmer R&D, but over time, are there opportunities to see leverage on that line given that there might be some duplicative efforts within the two companies and sort of quote R&D synergies and are those included at all in the $350 million number?", "Dan Florin", "Yes, the number was in that range. It was 80%. And it is - the math that you describe, as far as the measure by dollars that the capabilities are obviously diverse. It's between these organizations. So there is a positive impact in that regard.", "There is opportunity to repurpose those resources, and from our perspective go after a more differentiated research and development portfolio, both with internal and external development focused on the musculoskeletal space. And that's logical relative to the portfolios that we're bringing together and the need to continue to maintain the vitality of those go-forward systems, but to be able to invest in some higher risk, higher reward differentiated projects.", "At the same time, they're going to be very directly in addressing the unmet needs and getting after some of the opportunities to improve care and address the cost challenges that the customers face. So that's really exciting to us.", "I would tell you that it is not an area where we\u2019re looking to pull down our spend. So it is indeed to be a targeted area for expense synergy, if anything, I think that we're going to see big opportunities and potentially to expand our commitment in the research and development areas in absolute dollar spend in the coming years.", "David Roman", "Got it. I appreciate all the perspective. And Jim, best of luck in your future endeavors.", "Jim Crines", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.", "Richard Newitter", "Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. And good luck to you, Jim. I was hoping that you could talk a little bit more about the SET business. I think that was something you said was now 20% of your revenue base that you see having potential to grow in the mid-single-digit range. Just wondering if you\u2019d go over some of the opportunities there. The faster growing products or the product areas you're most excited about and how long you think - is that an area where you think you could maybe get acceleration faster than some of the other areas of your business, or is that the right way to think about it? Thanks.", "David Dvorak", "Sure. We are extraordinarily excited about the opportunities within that subset of the business. These are faster growing markets. And as I was describing earlier, these are markets that you can generally characterize as being ones where we've had businesses that have had some scale challenges historically. And those scale challenges create some headwinds both in commitments that you can make from an R&D spend, as well as the sales force build out, medical training education, other important ingredients to running these businesses successfully, and to do that in a profitable way and a value creating way from a stockholder perspective. So they really validate a major premise to this combination of the first instance. And I think you're going to see our performance in a direction that's consistent with that.", "I would tell you that I think that there are some big immediate opportunities in that cross-sell list, but those are consistent in the large joint areas too. So I don't think that they're differentiated in that regard. Good examples and opportunities across every one of the product categories is just that SET bunch of businesses have that - have the advantage of getting to scale, have the advantage of enhance sales force specialization being built into our plans, and reinvestment in that regard. And they're also operating in traditionally faster growing markets to begin with.", "So when you add all that up, we see that 20% portion of our business being very augmented to - and enhancer to our top line growth rates. So that mid-single-digit growth rate is sort of a short-term perspective, as to where we expect that business to get to. I would tell you that our aspiration is to drive it much, much higher than that.", "Richard Newitter", "Thanks. And maybe just one follow-up for Dan. As you think about the sequential growth acceleration trajectory that you laid out for \u201816, can you tell me, what\u2019s your implied assumption there on pricing trends for the year ahead? Do you assume it doesn't get any worse than where we are today, or are you embedding some incremental cushion for more - further erosion from where we stand today, and do you still think you can do sequential growth acceleration moving through the year in that situation?", "Dan Florin", "We've seen, as we discussed, very stable rate of decline on pricing over the past three or four quarters. Our assumption, as we look out to 2016 is consistent with that assumption, based on what we've seen. And so at this point in time, we're not assuming any break in trends from that perspective.", "David Dvorak", "Vince, we have time for one additional question.", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. Our last question comes from the line of William Plovanic with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.", "William Plovanic", "Great. Thanks. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. The first is just to go back on distribution. What are you doing specifically with the overlapping territories at the rep level? Are you retaining reps, are you repurposing them for Extremities? I\u2019m kind of - you've made a lot of comments in general [ph]. I'm just wondering if we could get some specifics from you, and then I have a follow-up. Thanks.", "David Dvorak", "Yes. Just to reiterate, William, we're retaining reps. There are too many opportunities by virtue of this combination from a product portfolio standpoint to be able to afford to lose good reps, so we're retaining the reps. And look, we're looking to leverage their strengths and the product portfolio strengths in the best way possible. And that means what they've done well historically is what we would continue to want see them leverage. And areas where they've done less well, we're going to look to augment. And so there are going to be opportunities for enhanced specialization, as all of that is designated, but we're going to make intelligent decisions driven by the people that are closest to the facts and circumstances that allow them to make informed judgments about that.", "But the tone is very, very upbeat among the sales force. They see the opportunity and I think fundamentally know that this isn't just a temporary opportunity on the front-end but rather that what we're able to build into the future and the pipeline and solutions that we're going to be able to lever is going to be a differentiated set and a comprehensive set. So that bodes very well for the success that we\u2019re looking to have in those conversations as we complete this integration by the end of the year on the commercial side.", "William Plovanic", "Okay. And then just, now that the merger is finally complete. Are there any assets that you view is really not core to the combined company?", "David Dvorak", "We see opportunities for all these assets to contribute to value creation at this point in time. And that doesn't mean that we're going to be overly rigid and cease to evaluate portfolio decisions going forward. It's about value creation.", "At this stage, our expectation is that all these assets are going to contribute and we're going to work real hard to help the leaders make those contributions. And to the extent that that view changes at some point in time, then we're going to make the decisions in the best interest of the stockholders that now we're really enthusiastic about the opportunities and synergies, by virtue of this portfolio coming together.", "We think that there is a real strategic advantage to the musculoskeletal focus that we have from an R&D standpoint, from an operations standpoint, from a go-to-market strategy standpoint. If anything, the evolving healthcare market is going to make that more important. And we think that we can be more impactful in helping shape those solutions going forward by virtue of these assets.", "William Plovanic", "Okay. And then, Jim, just thanks for all of your support over the years. I appreciate it. Thank you.", "David Dvorak", "Great. So I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today and for your continued interest and support for Zimmer Biomet. We look forward to speaking with you on the third quarter conference call, which is scheduled for 8:00 AM on October 29 later on this year.", "With that, I'll turn the call back to you, Vince.", "Operator", "Thank you, sir.

Good morning, and welcome to Zimmer Biomet's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. I'm here with our CEO, David Dvorak; and our CFO, Dan Florin.", "Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements.

Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.", "During our call, we will compare revenues on a constant currency adjusted pro forma basis.

We'll state all sales rates in constant currency terms and all earnings results on an adjusted basis.", "We're pleased to report that Zimmer Biomet's revenue was on the high-end of our first quarter expectations coming into the year, which further supports our confidence in achieving sequential improvement as we progress through 2016. Our comprehensive portfolio of musculoskeletal solutions and services provides a broad range of new opportunities for our sales channel, including a strengthened presence in a number of faster-growing product categories.", "Together with the increased stabilization and focused execution of our commercial teams, we remain on pace to exit the year at or above market growth rates. As we look to the future, Zimmer Biomet will continue to drive our established leadership with clinically proven devices and therapies, advanced surgical technologies and comprehensive consultative services.", "The strong combination of our broad portfolio, pipeline and unmatched musculoskeletal expertise allows us to play a leadership role in defining the future of healthcare through partnership opportunities with hospitals, surgeons and their patients. We'll bolster our portfolio throughout 2016 with strategic internal and external development opportunities.", "Our planned commercialization schedule includes over 50 new product launches this year, of which we've completed a dozen in the first quarter. These product launches included expansions to our market-leading knee and hip reconstructive systems, which I'll discuss in a moment.", "Our ongoing commercial introductions provide a firm foundation for sustainable revenue growth. Global musculoskeletal market conditions remain stable in the first quarter, with continued strength in United States and the Asia Pacific region. While there were ongoing challenges in certain emerging markets, these conditions were relatively consistent with recent quarters and in line with our expectations.", "With regard to pricing, we experienced price pressure of negative 0.9% in the quarter, consistent with our expectations. For the balance of the year, we continue to expect price pressure of approximately negative 2% when factoring in anticipated dynamics such as the bi-annual price adjustments in Japan.", "Against this backdrop, Zimmer Biomet delivered consolidated net sales of $1.9 billion for the first quarter, an increase of 67.8% reported and 1.2% adjusted over the prior-year period. Our first quarter performance was highlighted by ongoing sequential sales growth for our U.S. reconstructive business, which posted a 180 basis point improvement. Our overall sales in the Americas increased by 1.8% and by 3.6% in the Asia Pacific region, while our revenues decreased by 1.5% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region.", "Importantly, Zimmer Biomet knee business increased sales by 3.5% in the first quarter, reflecting positive volume and mix of 4.8% and negative price of 1.3%. We accelerated our U.S. knee performance, which contributed to a 3.3% year-over-year sales increase in the Americas. We also maintained strong revenues in the Asia Pacific region, where we delivered solid growth of 7.2%. Our knee sales increased by 1.9% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region over the prior-year period.", "In the quarter, our knee results were driven by our leading cross-sells, Persona, The Personalized Knee System, The Vanguard 360 Revision Knee System and the Oxford Partial Knee System. We were also excited to announce two commercial releases that expand the capabilities of our knee portfolio. Our OsseoTi Tibial Sleeves augments are a cutting-edge porous metal technology that adds to the breadth of the trusted Vanguard 360 Revision Knee System.", "We also introduced the Persona Medial Congruent Bearing, an innovative expansion of the Persona Knee System designed to recreate a more natural feeling knee by maximizing joint stability throughout the full range of motion. We'll continue to pursue growth with our knee portfolio, which combines market leading reconstructive systems with advanced surgical planning tools and intelligent instrumentation to offer patient and surgeons an extensive range of personalized solutions.", "Sales from our hip business increased by 0.5% in the first quarter, including positive volume and mix of 2.2% and negative price of 1.7%. Our hip revenues grew by 2.9% in the Asia Pacific region, increased by 1.3% in the Americas and decreased by 2.2% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region compared to the prior-year period.", "In the quarter, we were pleased with the growth of our Taperloc Complete System as well as our revision portfolio and solutions that leverage our vivacity and E1 Vitamin E infused advanced bearing materials. We also expanded the G7 Acetabular System with the introduction of the G7 Dual Mobility construct and strengthened our options for the rise in adoption of the anterior supine surgical approach with the introduction of the Echo Bi-Metric Microplasty stem. These product additions along with the balance of our comprehensive hip portfolio continue to position this business for renewed growth.", "Turning to our SET category. Revenues increased 0.2% over the prior-year period. Strong U.S. sales of our A.T.S., Automated Tourniquet System, contributed to the growth of our surgical business in the Americas. And we were encouraged by the solid results of our surgical power tools and certain overseas geographies.", "The steady growth of our Extremities business, most notably in the Americas and Asia Pacific region also added to our SET revenues. Our SET results were negatively impacted in the quarter by our Trauma performance. We expect to deliver improved growth in the second half of the year with our Trauma business, supported by the increased stabilization and productivity of our commercial channel.", "Within Sports Medicine, we continue to be pleased with steady sales of our joint preservation treatments, Gel-One Hyaluronate and the Subchondroplasty Procedure, which was expanded in 2015 to address the growing foot and ankle market. And earlier this week, we announced that we've entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Arizona-based Cayenne Medical. This acquisition, which remains subject to customary closing conditions, will enhance our Sports Medicine capabilities and add a successful portfolio of soft tissue repair and reconstructive solutions for knee, shoulder and extremities procedures.", "Our dental sales decreased by 6% in the first quarter, due primarily to headwinds associated with the voluntary product action in the fourth quarter. We expect supply to fully recover by the end of the second quarter. We also continue to make good progress with the ongoing harmonization of our dental commercial channel. Backed by our broad dental portfolio, we're focused on achieving improved results in the second half of year for this business.", "First quarter sales from our spine, craniomaxillofacial and thoracic category decreased by 1% from the prior-year period. Our craniomaxillofacial and thoracic team delivered noteworthy growth in the quarter and they continue to generate strong sales of our TraumaOne and SternaLock Blu systems. Additionally, they made great progress with the recently launched RibFix Blu System and the OmniMax MMF System.", "In spine, our commercial teams continue to stabilize throughout the first quarter, which supports our confidence for an expected return of growth later this year. We also achieved sales growth for innovative offerings across our spine portfolio, including the Timberline Lateral Fusion System and the Virage OCT Spinal Fixation System. Looking to the future of this business, we're excited for the opportunities represented by our commercial pipeline and focused sales channel.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Dan, who will continue this discussion in greater detail as well as review our increased revenue and adjusted earnings guidance. Dan?", "Daniel Florin", "Thank you, David. I will review our first quarter performance in more detail, and then provide additional information related to our second quarter and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance.", "Our total revenues for the first quarter were $1,904 million, an increase of 1.2% constant currency compared to the first quarter of 2015 on an adjusted pro forma basis. The company recorded the same number of billing days in the quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2015.", "Net currency impact for the quarter decreased revenues by 1.6% or $30 million. The negative currency impact for the quarter was related to the ongoing relative strength of the U.S. dollar against many international currencies.", "Our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.7% for the quarter and 30 basis points lower when compared to the prior year adjusted pro forma result, due to the impact of foreign exchange and price decline, mostly offset by gains from our cash flow hedging program and a reduction in the expense recognition of the medical device excise tax.", "The company's R&D expense was 4.5% of revenue at $85.7 million. As David noted, we commercially launched a dozen new products in the first quarter and we expect to continue to that pace throughout the balance of this year, with introductions coming from across the entirety of our product categories.", "Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $716.9 million in the first quarter or 37.7% of sales, 130 basis points lower than the comparable period in the prior year on an adjusted pro forma basis. The positive variance was driven by continued savings in SG&A expense categories, stemming from synergy capture initiatives, which were partially offset by ongoing investments in our specialized sales force, in addition to medical education and training program.", "We remain on track to deliver cumulative net EBIT synergies of $225 million by the end of 2016 per our original full year guidance. Synergies realized in the first quarter were in line with our expectation. In the quarter, the company recorded pre-tax charges of $393.6 million in special items, primarily related to the Biomet acquisition as well as integration-related expenses.", "Adjusted first quarter 2016 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these charges, which includes $285 million of non-cash amortization and inventory step-up charges, as well as $109 million of integration and other costs. A full reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning's press release.", "Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to $639.1 million or 33.6% of sales, which was flat when compared to the prior-year period. Net interest expense and other non-operating expense totaled $90.7 million. Adjusted net earnings were $404.3 million for the first quarter, an increase of 51.5% compared to the prior-year period.", "Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 29.9% to $2 per share on 202 million weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.3%. The company had approximately 200.7 million shares of common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2016, increasing from 172.8 million shares as of March 31, 2015, due primarily to the Biomet transaction.", "During the quarter, the company invested $415.5 million to repurchase 4.2 million shares. Our share repurchase activity during the quarter was expanded relative to our original guidance and this provided approximately $0.02 of EPS benefit in the quarter.", "Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $265.2 million, which included $85 million of cash expenditures for integration and initiatives related to our synergy program. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $112.7 million, which included $85.1 million for instrument and $27.6 million for property, plant and equipment.", "Free cash flow in the quarter was $152.5 million, which was essentially flat with the first quarter of 2015 and in line with our expectation. During the quarter, the company repaid $400 million on our term loan, leaving $2,100 million outstanding at March 31. And this reflects $900 million of repayment, since the closing of the Biomet transaction.", "With that, I'd like to now turn to our guidance. I will provide updated revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance for the full year and expectations for the second quarter.", "For 2016, we now estimate our adjusted pro forma revenue growth to be in the range of 2.0% to 3.0% on a constant currency basis. This update is reflective of our confidence in the ongoing progress of our cross-selling initiatives and increasing sales channel productivity.", "Foreign exchange is now expected to decrease revenue by 1% compared to our previous estimate of 2%, with the U.S. dollar weakening modestly across most currency pair. Taken together, reported revenue growth for the year should be in a range of 1.0% to 2.0% or a range of $7,525 million to $7,600 million.", "For modeling purposes, we will have you update the fully diluted share count estimates to reflect the noted acceleration and timing of share repurchases embedded in our prior guidance.", "We now anticipate the diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the full year to be approximately 202 million shares. Therefore, after updating our assumptions for foreign exchange and our fully diluted share count, our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share is now projected to be in a range of $7.85 to $8.", "Our guidance takes into account our noted investment into our sales channel specialization, innovative research and development program and medical education and training to drive sustainable longer-term growth. Our guidance reflects approximately 100 basis points of forecasted operated margin expansion over the prior year on an adjusted pro forma basis.", "Now, turning to the second quarter. Including the benefit of slightly more than one extra billing day, which equates to about 180 basis points, we expect constant currency revenues to increase between 3.0% and 4.0%. At this time, assuming currency rates remain where they have been during the first month of this quarter, we anticipate foreign currency translation will decrease our reported second quarter revenues by approximately 1%.", "Taken together, reported revenue growth will be in a range of 2.0% to 3.0% for the quarter. Therefore, revenue will be expected to be in a range to $1,885 million to $1,905 million. Lastly, we expect second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range between $1.93 and $1.98.", "Finally, please note that our full year guidance reflects the anticipated contribution from our recently announced acquisition of Cayenne Medical, assuming that the transaction closes in the second quarter, which in total represents about 10 basis points of topline growth for the full year. However, our guidance does not include any impacts from other potential business development transaction or unforeseen event.", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to David.", "David Dvorak", "Thanks, Dan. We look forward to building on Zimmer Biomet's first quarter performance throughout the balance of 2016 as well as maintain our progress towards exiting the year at or above market growth rates. We'll continue capitalizing on the growing strength of our commercial organization and our comprehensive musculoskeletal portfolio.", "And lastly, we'll also remain focused on sustaining our earnings performance and driving operating margin leverage in 2016, while continuing to meet our financial commitments and exercising disciplined capital allocation.", "And now, I'd like to ask Cleona to begin the Q&A portion of our call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Matt Taylor from Barclays.", "Young Li", "This is Young Li in for Matt. I guess to start off, I was wondering if you can maybe talk about some of the initial CJR feedback or experience. Any impact since the program officially started earlier in the month? Understand that various players in the system had time to prepare for it. But is there anything surprising or notable so far that you would like to call out?", "Daniel Florin", "Well, I would tell you that, Young, first of all we're excited about the opportunity that CJR provides. Going back a decade now we've been building out a comprehensive set of not only implant solutions, but services in a comprehensive nature in anticipation of a world that would be more consistent with what CJR is contemplating, that is how do we go about developing deeper partnerships with customers to bring higher quality of care in the most cost-efficient way possible.", "Our acquisition going back nine years ago of Accelero and the services they bring to their patient flow are focused exclusively on that area. And we've been able to bridge technologies and still more services to help develop those partnerships and build out a comprehensive care package that gets into patient engagement earlier in that episode of care, all the way through post acute care with rehabilitative services.", "And coming back to your question, that last area is probably where the light is going off in our customer conversation, with realizations that as much as 40% of the cost of care is incurred post acute, so the rehabilitation end of joint replacement. I would tell you that the customers are in different places right now, and their level of developing plans that are truly going to be responsive to the economic model that they're going to be living within going forward, so the early adopters and more progressive thinkers have been very sophisticated and were far long in developing key partnerships and enhancing their capabilities to be prepared for that day.", "Others are coming to grips with the reality that over time their world is going to shift away from fee-for-service. But in any event, we feel like we have a lot to offer with a full portfolio of solutions and services in that context. And it is the case, I do believe that as I was just referencing, that it's caused more energy on the customer part to be focused over to the post-acute care dimension of delivering the total joint solution.", "Young Li", "I guess regarding the trauma weakness in the quarter that you called out, can you go into a little bit more detail as to what drove that? Is it impact from weather or any weakness in geographies you want to call out?", "David Dvorak", "I don't think that this is much of a market dynamic as it is us rebuilding momentum and focus within the commercial execution side. We have a very strong portfolio. It is the case that weather and other external drivers can impact the trauma market, but I don't think that that usually measures up to be anything more than 100 basis points or 200 basis points.", "So we are highly confident as we continue to build out specialized sales force within that category on a global basis, that is, and continue the cross-selling training on the product side, that we're going to show material improvements in that business unit as we progress through 2016.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America.", "Bob Hopkins", "Two questions; one thing that really struck me was your guidance for revenue growth in the second quarter. You were calling for some very nice acceleration there. And I was wondering if you could just talk about some of the things that you see really driving that acceleration in the second quarter versus the first? Is that on the hip and knee side, is it across the portfolio? I assume a little bit of it's in dental. Just maybe talk about the really nice acceleration you expect in Q2?", "David Dvorak", "We referenced just so you have an apples-to-apples comparison sequentially, Bob, the impact of billing days. So there is an enhancement by virtue of billing days in the second quarter, but notwithstanding that, we showed continued progression in our forecast as we displayed from Q4 to Q1 and we just believed that everything that we're doing to stabilize the sales force, to invest in the non-large joint categories, in particular, with expansion of that sales force, the cross-training, the medical training education events, all of that is building towards the progress in each of the product categories.", "And so I would tell you that it is very broad-based. Quite literally every geographic segment and every product category is anticipated to improve sequentially between now and the end of the year. And it's one of the reasons that we have such strong confidence in that progression is there isn't a single category that's driving it. Rather, every category is expected to prove in each quarter between now and the balance of the year.", "And I think that we're seeing it earlier probably in large joints and it stands to reason that that would be the case with the size of the business and those portfolios and the historic culture being ultra-focused on large joints and knees in particular. So I think knees is out ahead even within large joints of hips, but we are seeing the same signs of continued improvement in hips.", "And then I would tell you that the SET category is expected to show some very material improvement beginning in the second quarter and continuing into the second half of the year. It's driven by the cross-sell primarily, but we're starting to lace in, as we begun to emphasize some of the new product introductions too. And as we get into the second half of the year, we'll see some of the early signs of traction with those product launches that went out in the first quarter.", "Bob Hopkins", "And then one other quickly I want to touch on is just EMEA, is there an action plan. That seemed to be one area in the large joint side that was a little weaker. So maybe is there an action plan to sort of turn that a little bit? And maybe just talk about the prospects for EMEA as you look forward the rest of the year?", "Daniel Florin", "Yes. You're right. And this is one where we've seen excellent historic progress and generated great results over a long time period and so that team are the proven leaders and winners within that market. So we have all the talent that we need, and in an enhanced portfolio I think it's probably a geographic segment that has had more work to do on the integration front. And if you think about integrating within those jurisdictions, you have work councils and some external pacing items that sort of create inhibitors to getting after the cross-sell opportunity, for example.", "We're pushing through those consistent with our plans, and I think that what you saw in Q1, Bob, was the consistent performance, if not on large joints, a bit of sequential improvement from Q4 to Q1. And we expect to see another step in that direction and a pretty significant step up in the SET category. So we have good visibility to improve performance and that ought to stair step in Q2, Q3 and Q4 within EMEA.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.", "David Lewis", "I wanted to start off on a financial question for Dan on earnings. I guess, Dan, a couple of things going on here. One, solid quarter, obviously better than our expectations, a little bit. You also have currency going for you, specifically with the yen. And then look, given that you're holding the line on cost and driving synergies, and you had this improving revenue outlook, it just seems to me like with that increased drop through, earnings guidance is a little on the conservative side.", "So can you walk me through any headwinds I could be missing? So I just feel like better quarter, better guide, better currency, the guide could have come up more. I appreciate it's early in the year, but there're factors that we're not missing that suggest that we have some earnings headwinds?", "Daniel Florin", "David I wouldn't call them earnings headwinds, I call them intentional investment to drive topline growth. Smart investments focused at topline growth. So as we have indicated, for example, on the medical device tax, the suspension of that, the reinvestment of that, that's embedded in our guidance --it's still embedded in our guidance.", "And then as we look at the balance of the year, with respect to the currency tailwind, we do see opportunities to continue to make investment in our areas of focus such as specialized sales forces, medical education and training globally, but also importantly in the emerging market to sustain that growth.", "Our R&D programs, investing in personalized solutions and consultative services that add value across the continuum of care that David spoke about, enhanced instrument deployments to further drive cross-sell, and things of that nature. So as we look at the opportunity to reinvest, we're keenly focused on proper drop-through of better earnings, but also reinvesting that where it make sense to reinvest.", "David Lewis", "So it's safe to assume you're feeling pretty good about your earnings and cash flow visibility right here?", "Daniel Florin", "Yes.", "David Lewis", "And then, David, another obviously thing that we're not expecting was this early in the year to raise your confidence in your organic numbers or constant currency numbers for the business on the top line. Our sense is there's two dynamics going on here, in the first quarter.", "One is, the market certainly feels a little better in reconstruction, based on some of your peers, but it also does appear on the margin you're narrowing the gap from a competitive share loss. Can you sort of talk to us about those two dynamics? How you feel about the market how you feel about narrowing your share gap?", "David Dvorak", "Sure, David. Both of those dynamics are very accurate. We have seen, particularly in the U.S., a step-up in large joints. I think that the EMEA market is healthier than what we're currently experiencing as we were just responding to the prior question on that front. So the market is healthy in large joints and we know that we have big opportunities in other product categories as well.", "The focus on the large joint categories we have been improving our performance sequentially even above the rate of the improvement in the market growth rates, and so over a 100 basis points of GAAP closure in large joints as a whole, and that's been driven both by U.S. and o U.S. knee improvement. We see the U.S. knees improving about 70 basis points relative to market performance; o U.S. knees improving about 160 basis points relative to market.", "And U.S. hips as well going from Q4 to Q1 improved about 120 basis points, so those GAAP closures are really important measures, as you referenced, but it's always nice to be participating in a robust market itself. And both of those factors contribute to the visibility that we have to improve the performance and close the GAAP, and as a consequence raise our guidance for the full year to the 2% to 3%.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne Wuensch", "One of the things that we've been seeing a lot has been sort of that strength in the overall market for medical devices. And again, I apologize if you have gone into this already, is that what you're witnessing also? And if so, do you have a theory why?", "Daniel Florin", "I think that the fundamental demographic drivers, Joanne, I think we are seeing healthy markets stable. There is a bit of an offset obviously as everyone else has been discussing relative to certain of the emerging market. The Latin America headwinds are still real consistent with expectations coming into the year. The Q4 and Q1 have been healthy markets in the developed countries and we certainly have benefitted from them. We look to benefit to a greater extent as the quarters progress in 2016 with our execution.", "Operator", "We will now take our next question from Mike Matson from Needham & Company.", "Mike Matson", "I was just wondering if you could maybe give us an update on where you stand with the efforts to develop your specialized sales forces. I know you've been focusing more on that since you completed the merger with Biomet?", "Daniel Florin", "Sure. We have a good pipeline and we've made progress even in the first quarter in that regard. Mike, right now, outside of large joints on a global basis, we have round numbers 2,000 sales reps exclusively focused in the other categories. And between now and the balance of the decade, we look to expand that sales force in a material fashion and 2016 represents our first installment. So you could measure our plans in the hundreds in that regard. In 2016, we're tracking consistent with that plan.", "Step one was obviously the second half of 2015 to make the integration steps and stabilize those sales forces. We've rebuilt the pipeline of talent and that talent is coming to fruition, so we're in a net add position as of Q1 even, and we will look to accelerate that for the balance of the year. So I feel like we're executing those plans very well and we're already seeing some of the early signs of traction. It's part of what gives us confidence and accelerated topline growth between now and the balance of the year.", "Mike Matson", "And then just in the trauma business, this seems like a market where having scale and breadth is really critical, and I was just wondering now, with Biomet products in the mix, do you feel like you've got the critical mass to really compete against the leaders DePuy and Stryker?", "David Dvorak", "We absolutely are confident that we do. We have the existing portfolio to complete effectively. And you're right, scale does matter and in this category, the level ones and the level twos demand, comprehensive portfolios, and it's tough to be a niche player in that phase. And the combination greatly enhances our competitiveness within trauma.", "The other thing that it does is, and it's consistent across some of the other non-large joint categories for us, it puts us in a position to continue to innovate in a more diversified way and get after some of the higher risk, higher return projects to address on that needs in that category.", "And so rest assured that not only do we expect to execute with the current portfolio in an effective manner, but our pipeline is going to be more diverse than it's ever been and the scale gives us that opportunity. So we would look to address on that needs and push out really to establish ourselves as true innovators within the trauma space in due time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Roman of Goldman Sachs.", "David Roman", "I wanted just to start with a comment you made in response to a prior question regarding reinvesting some of the better expected top line performance, as well as the earnings upside in Q1. Can you maybe give us a little bit more detail on where those dollars are going, whether that's on the sales and marketing side, or R&D? When you would expect us to see a return on that incremental investment?", "Daniel Florin", "I responded earlier in terms of the types of investments, so there were clearly be a focus on the R&D line. So you can expect to see our spend at the R&D line to improve or to expand sequentially as we progresses through the year and that's a fairly broad base sort of investments focused on large joints, SET, programs aimed at our personalized solutions portfolio as we discussed.", "You'll also see in the SG&A categories some reinvestment, medical education and training, so that takes the form of training new surgeon around the world, capitalizing on the opportunity that the cross-sell investments in med ed in emerging markets, and specialized sales force, as David just mentioned adding hundreds of incremental focused sales rep particularly in the SET categories, and things of that nature. So I think you'll see it mainly in the R&D line, but also in SG&A as we progress through the year.", "David Roman", "And then maybe a broader question for David. You've had three quarters since the Biomet transaction was completed, now under your belt. You have seen an improvement in your revenue growth rate. Maybe you could just help us think about what you observed over the past several quarters, and any learnings that you think will inform your go-forward investments that gets you back to that market growth rate, because clearly things are getting better, but still sitting below that 3% level. So what are you seeing in your experience thus far, and are there any changes you're making on your go-forward strategy to help accelerate the pace of getting back to market growth?", "David Dvorak", "Sure, David. I think we have an opportunity, because of the pendency period that was prolonged for 14 months between signing and closing to do extensive planning. And the teams took advantage of that time and developed extraordinarily detailed integration plans to go after the topline opportunity as well as the operating expense opportunities, and it's pretty clear based upon our execution that we've been able to, if anything, retrieve and realize the operating expense synergies in an accelerated fashion as evidenced by last year's performance in that regard.", "I think to your question, you end up with the best visibility one can have in planning those topline opportunities and now we're in a stage where we're executing it. So we're making refinements and part of what Dan is outlining, by the way of reinvestment, would include something like the products that are going, and beyond, in theory having a cross-sell opportunity, we're realizing success.", "We're up in production. We're ordering more instruments. And so that's a good example of the reality. With any new product launch, and as we referred to it as sort of the mother of all product launches, you end up having some surprises both negative and positive, and where we see the positive surprises, we're going to fuel that growth.", "So we've got a stable channel. We're on a net basis adding sales reps in an intelligent way relative to our opportunity to make sure that our coverage is going to exploit fully the broad bag that we have, and then we're dialing it up in medical training and education and instruments and inventory where we see the growth opportunities because of early traction in the sales force. And that visibility is extraordinarily helpful. It gives us line of sight, as to sequentially between now and the end of the year, what we think we can do.", "David Roman", "Can I sneak one more quick one in here? Dan, what does it all mean for the cash flow profile of the business, and if you're upping medical training, inventory, et cetera, are you still comfortable with the cash flow guidance you provided last quarter or does this still -- do some of these initiatives soak that up? And then I'll drop.", "Daniel Florin", "David, we're still comfortable with the previous cash flow guidance that we provided both on an operating and free cash flow basis.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matt Miksic from UBS.", "Matt Miksic", "I hope I haven't asked a question here that's already been covered, but David, I'd love to get your sense on some of the pricing trends we're seeing in the market have been more favorable. I think at the lower end of your range, it's not the first quarter I think for you and some other folks that reported some similar trends. And I would just love to get a sense of what you think is driving that, or not to diminish less of your pricing, but is it possible that it has anything to do with your year-over-year SKU for SKU calculations with the deal? Any color would be helpful. And I have one follow-up.", "Daniel Florin", "We're comfortable with the consistency of the calculation and the visibility that's provided. We had had a successful quarter in managing the business in this regard in Q4, and as you know another successful quarter in Q1 of 2016. Some of it has to do with just our forward visibility to contracts and renewals and what's in the pipeline.", "And so we came into the year expecting minus 2. We continue to expect something closer to that in subsequent quarters. Q2, Q3 and Q4 of 2016, and contributing to that potential uptick relative to where we were in Q1 is going to be the biannual price adjustment in Japan, which comes online here at the beginning of the second quarter, so that's sort of been quantified. It's consistent with most of the past adjustments, say, in mid-single digits based upon our product mix.", "So you can look at that as being the potential for round numbers, a 20 basis points uptick on a consolidated basis, but I think that we're managing the business intelligently. I mean one of the benefits of the combination is the capability with this broad portfolio to product position, and with the breadth of the portfolio and the capability to tier these products and better match the demand, the needs of customers, it puts us in a better position to maintain pricing on premium technologies, for example, across the globe, that is. And with the increased transparency on pricing across the globe, that's a big asset.", "So it's a good new story. The teams are taking advantage of that opportunity, but again, its two good quarters in that regard and we don't want to call it a stronger trend at this point in time. That probably does cause us to moderate a bit the negative 2% price expectation coming into the year, but we think that we're going to edge above up the 0.9 that we experienced in Q1, as we move into Q2 and beyond.", "Matt Miksic", "That's helpful. I appreciate why we wouldn't necessarily want to get too excited about pricing, given where we've been, but that is encouraging. And I had one follow-up on the subject that you talked about, I think earlier in the Q&A, on bundling. Coming out of AAOS, it struck me that, yes, most of the costs that could come out of this bundled payment push, and we're early in that understanding, that is downstream after post-op and rehab, et cetera.", "But it also strikes me that you've talked about, I think some of your other larger orthopedic competitors have talked about stepping into the void for some of these networks, to help them understand and deal with managing those downstream costs, which are often out of the hospital or with third-party partners. And so I'd love to understand how you see that playing out in terms of sort of the value you're providing and the benefit that you would hope to get from that sort of expanded relationship in networks, as you sort of team up to get your arms around or get their arms this change?", "David Dvorak", "It's a big dynamic and a big opportunity, Matt. And it's so consistent with our focus on musculoskeletal care, up and down the continuum and across the episode of care with systems, solutions and services. And this has been our strategy going back for the better part of a decade. So we really do believe, we're uniquely positioned, and these conversations and the partnership that we're entering into reflected that, the breadth of our portfolio and our commitment to developing these partnerships in a manner that adds value is going to be long-term and deep.", "I will tell you, every one of those conversations is validating to the work that we've done. As I said, over the last decade, I think that you can envision a day where it's very much the case that the end-to-end patient engagement is something that we're more deeply involved with. And as a consequence of the data and insight that we glean in partnership with customers that are progressive thinkers in this regard that we're mining that data, creating the right treatment algorithms, and the right clinical and economic support that announces where the unmet needs are and the opportunities for continuous improvement on both clinical and economic basis. And that's our vision.", "And there are a lot of customers across the globe that share that vision. And I think that, again, there are limited numbers of companies that can sit at the table with the offerings that we have to bring value to that conversation and be able to follow through and deliver. So we're excited about the opportunity and you're going to hear a lot more from us going forward on that front.", "Matt Miksic", "And just if I could, so to speak -- I'm still on the line here?", "David Dvorak", "You are.", "Matt Miksic", "Thanks for that. The difficult part for us, I think, in looking at that engagement is the value exchange. Clearly, I think you can provide value to your larger customers in a way that a smaller player can't and a less broad provider can't. And I guess, how do we think about not to be all about share and compliance and penetration, but how does Zimmer benefit from this over the long term? Is it contracting? How should we think about it?", "David Dvorak", "I think its deeper partnerships, Matt. And I think that one doesn't want to take too superficial of a view and jump to the monetization of that relationship, rather I think it needs to be about value creation. And if there is true value creation opportunity, we believe that there is true value creation opportunity through those deeper partnerships, there is going to be plenty of opportunity to sharing that upside and broader relationship up and down.", "Again, that continuum of care and that episode of care, and you can envision from the point of diagnosis and joint preservation through sports medicine, partial, total, revision, salvage, and the large joint, biological solutions, interventions that make sense both clinically and economically, we are convinced that there is value to be gathered for both parties and all the other stakeholders, and most importantly patients. And if we get that right, we're going to be able to figure the rest of it out.", "So that's the mindset that we have in entering into those relationships. A lot of flexibility and agility to get after making a difference for patients, and that's going to redound all the other stakeholders benefits. And we're sure that we'll participate that in an appropriate way.", "Robert Marshall", "Cleona, we have time for one additional question.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies.", "Raj Denhoy", "Wonder if I could ask two questions. You did note the gap in joints in the market has certainly improved, which was great to see. But some of the other business, the other 40% of the business continued to lag a bit. And I know you've described your plans for getting those back up. But perhaps you could just describe whether the integration of those businesses has proven to be a bit more challenging perhaps than the large joint side? Is there anything to that or is it really just taking a bit longer?", "David Dvorak", "I think it's just timing to get after the opportunity more than anything, Raj, as it relates to the SET businesses. The opportunity that we have with this combination to materially enhance the focus from a commercial standpoint is one that we're taking advantage of. And we're going to start to see in the short-term, as in Q2, some of the benefits in the SET categories.", "And then you jump outside of the SET categories, down we had a unique event with a field action back in Q4. As we've referenced, we were working through that challenge and Q1 will be out of that challenge by the end of Q2, and that's going to help enhanced the performance of the dental business.", "And then as we noted all along, the commercial integration on the spine side was known to be more challenging. And so we're going to like the result, but that one is going to take a quarter or two longer than the large joint. So we're tracking very consistently with what our integration plans contemplated, Raj. And the teams are doing an excellent job from our perspective on the execution front.", "Raj Denhoy", "Just one last one, just on cash use. The cash flow over the next several years is going to be pretty significant for you guys as well as your access to cash. And in the quarter you did a small deal, but you also bought back a lot of stock. And so really just curious how you were thinking about the balance between those two efforts as well as perhaps paying down debt a bit sooner? Whether your thinking has evolved or really where it stands right now?", "Daniel Florin", "Raj, I would say that our thinking on that remains as it has been, which is we continue to be interested in smart business development opportunities with a strategic focus remaining on musculoskeletal. We'll remain discipline in that regard. We'll look for targets that leverage our sales channel to drive sustainable growth and maximize shareholder value. And we'll also stay focused and show sustainable and solid returns within a reasonable time horizon.", "So I wouldn't think of any shift in that regard. We're still very focused on driving improvements in our free cash flow yield out overtime that will continue to be a focus, and that gives us a lot of flexibility as we progress looking at debt pay down, M&A activity, dividend payment and so on and so forth. So we will stay very disciplined as we always have been.", "End of Q&A", "David Dvorak", "With that, I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today and for your continued interest and support for Zimmer Biomet. We look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter conference call, which is scheduled for 8:00 AM on July 28. So I'll turn the call back to you, Cleona.", "Operator", "Thank you, again, for participating in today's conference call.

(NYSE:ZBH) Q3 2016 Earnings Conference Call October 31, 2016  8:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Robert Marshall - VP, IR and Treasurer", "David Dvorak - CEO", "Dan Florin - CFO", "Analysts", "Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Matthew O'Brien - Piper Jaffray", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "David Lewis - Morgan Stanley", "Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo", "Matt Miksic - UBS", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Matt Taylor - Barclays", "Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners", "Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets", "Operator", "Good morning ladies and gentlemen. I would like to turn the call over to Bob Marshall, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. Mr. Marshall, you may begin your call.", "Robert Marshall", "Good morning and welcome to Zimmer Biomet's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. I'm here with our CEO, David Dvorak and our CFO, Dan Florin. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties. ", "Also the discussions during this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included within the earnings release, which is available at our website at investor.zimmerbiomet.com.", "With that, I'll now turn the call over to David.", "David Dvorak", "Thanks Bob. This morning, I will review our third quarter financial results, as well as provide an overview of some of our new technologies and solutions, and the focused actions we are taking to drive sustainable growth. Dan will then provide additional financial details and discuss our updated guidance.", "Zimmer Biomet\u2019s third quarter revenue performance was highlighted by the acceleration of our S.E.T. category, and ongoing strength in our Asia Pacific region. However, consolidated sales were below our expectations on weaker than anticipated results from our large joint and dental categories. Overall, broad demand for our differentiated portfolio remained high throughout the quarter, particularly for our focus cross-sell products.", "Variable commercial performances by our sales teams were in part caused by unanticipated supply constraints related to our transitioning supply-chain infrastructure. This resulted in shortfalls that needed implants and additional instrument sets to fully exploit sales opportunities in key product categories. In response to this challenge, we have accelerated work to enhance certain aspects of our supply-chain infrastructure as we harmonize and optimize our sourcing, manufacturing and quality management systems.", "Through these efforts we expect to improve our demand fulfillment in the coming months. As a consequence of these supply constraints, we project fourth-quarter sales results to be similar to those of the third quarter. However as we look ahead, we remain confident in our ability to successfully reaccelerate our revenue growth in 2017. As I mentioned, demand for our expansive portfolio of differentiated and clinically proven musculoskeletal technology, solutions and services has never been stronger. Our global sales organizations remain stable and have in fact achieved a third consecutive quarter of net personnel additions.", "These teams remain focused on delivering high-quality personalized solutions to our customers and their patients. To that end, during the quarter we consummated a number of strategic external development transactions to expand our musculoskeletal portfolio and capabilities while continuing to deliver leveraged earnings-per-share. By joining together with LDR Spine in mid-July we now possess a leading position in the attractive global market for cervical disk replacement.", "Additionally, our recently completed acquisition of Medtech SA provides us with current brain and spine robotic technology, and positions us to identify and develop additional applications for the ROSA robotics minimally invasive platform. This differentiated technology supports our strategy to offer the industry\u2019s most comprehensive range of intelligent instrumentation options.", "Also during the quarter we acquired new clinical solutions that extend our reach across the continuum of care, spanning from state of the art 3-D range of motion simulation software to an innovative telerehabilitation platform. These portfolio additions are designed to support healthcare providers in personalizing musculoskeletal treatment. Importantly, these assets further strengthen our Zimmer Biomet\u2019s Signature Solutions offering, which is designed to assist hospitals and medical practices to seamlessly transition to value-based healthcare models.", "With our end to end clinical services, proprietary technologies and analytical tools we are enabling healthcare providers to maximize productivity and patient engagement across the entire episode of care. As have previously communicated, the rollout of Zimmer Biomet\u2019s Signature Solutions comes in an opportune time when an increasing number of healthcare providers are striving to comply with bundled payment models by placing a greater emphasis on the quality and cost effectiveness of knee and hip replacement service lines.", "Before I review the performance of each of our sales categories, I would like to comment on third quarter market conditions. We noted overall global market stability during the quarter. In addition, we believe that while the US market demonstrated some softness during the summer months, it strengthened towards the end of the quarter. With regard to pricing, we experienced negative 1.9% of pressure, which was in line with expectations and consistent with trends in recent years.", "Against this backdrop, Zimmer Biomet delivered third quarter consolidated net sales of $1.83 billion. This performance represented 3.5% of constant currency growth over the prior year quarter of which the recently acquired LDR Holding Corporation contributed 190 basis points. Embedded within these results, we achieved solid 6.4% top line growth in the Asia-Pacific region, while growing sales in the Americas by 3.7% and by 0.9% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region.", "Zimmer Biomet\u2019s knee business was flat on a global basis in the third quarter reflecting positive volume and mix of 1.9% and negative price of 2%. Our 2.6% sales growth in the Asia-Pacific region was offset by our results in the Americas, where sales decreased by 0.9%. Our knee revenues increased by 0.3% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region as compared to the prior year quarter.", "Despite continuing attractive growth rates during the quarter for Persona, the Personalized Knee System, our sales execution on this leading cross selling opportunity was limited by the supply issues I just mentioned. The Oxford Partial Knee also delivered solid sales results during the quarter.", "Additionally, we were pleased to announce the commercial launch of our Vanguard Individualized Design total knee replacement system. This first of its kind total knee construct supports our soft tissue preservation focus and market leadership with independent medial and lateral polyethylene bearing that simplify soft tissue preservation and balance. We are committed to driving focused execution in support of stronger knee results in future quarters with this exceptional portfolio.", "Third-quarter hip sales grew by 0.6% reflecting positive volume and mix of 3.0% and negative price of 2.4%. We grew revenues by a solid 5.9% in the Asia-Pacific region, while sales were flat in the Americas. Hip sales decreased by 1.4% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region compared to the prior year quarter. Within this overall performance we continue to drive the sales growth of our Taperloc Complete System", "and Arcos Modular Femoral Revision System, as well as offerings that leverage Zimmer Biomet\u2019s proprietary Vitamin E-infused advanced bearing materials.", "We were also pleased with the commercial traction of the recently introduced G7 Dual Mobility Construct. We are well positioned to build on these successes in future periods by leveraging the industry\u2019s most comprehensive range of hip solutions.", "Turning to our S.E.T. category, we achieved a healthy 7.8% increase in global revenues, supported by solid results in all geographic segments. In our surgical business, we have been pleased with the ongoing progress of our growing specialized sales channel and the commercial success of our diversified offerings for the OR suite.", "Our Sports Medicine results were once again driven by our proprietary Subchondroplasty procedure and Gel-One Cross-linked Hyaluronate Injection. Similarly, our extremities business continued to leverage our market-leading upper extremities portfolio, including the Comprehensive Total Shoulder System and the Nexel Total Elbow. ", "Lastly, we delivered ongoing improvement in trauma with third quarter sales being led by our AFFIXUS Hip Fracture Nail System and NCB Plating system. We expect that our S.E.T. product category will remain an integral component of our sustainable revenue growth platform with innovative clinical solutions that meet the needs of surgeons, patients and healthcare institutions.", "Dental sales decreased by 7.6%, which was below our expectations. Nonetheless, we achieved good performances from the 3i T3 Implant system and the recently introduced aesthetic implant system. Looking forward we expect to more fully capitalize on this and additional future product launches as we enhance our multitiered offerings to address an evolving dental marketplace.", "Our spine, craniomaxillofacial and thoracic category sales increased by 23.9% on a constant currency basis in the third quarter, which represented approximately 1% organic growth. Following our recent LDR acquisition, we are making good progress we the initial phases of integration throughout our spine commercial organization. Among our spine offerings, we have been encouraged by the sustained revenue performance of the Mobi-C Cervical Disc prosthesis. Last week we announced that Mobi-C is now the most widely covered device for one and two level cervical disc replacement by commercial health insurers in the United States.", "In addition, we also continued to deliver growth with the Vitality Spinal Fixation System. We are well positioned to continue to bolster the competitiveness of our spine business with an expanded portfolio and strengthening sales channel.", "With regard to our craniomaxillofacial and thoracic business we continue to be pleased with the ongoing strong sales growth of the SternaLock Blu and SternaLock 360 primary closure systems, as well as the OmniMax MMF System. ", "With that, I will turn it over to Dan, who will continue this discussion in greater detail as well as review our updated revenue and earnings guidance. Dan?", "Dan Florin", "Thank you, David. I will review our third quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to fourth quarter and full-year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. Our total revenues for the third quarter were $1.833 billion, an increase of 3.5% adjusted constant currency when compared to the third quarter of 2015, and 1.6% excluding the contribution from the LDR acquisition.", "The net currency impact for the quarter was a positive 60 basis points or $11 million on consolidated revenue results. We had an immaterial difference in billings days in the quarter as compared to the third quarter of 2015. Third-quarter revenue was below our expectations primarily due to execution issues within our large joint supply-chain, which led to degradation in order fulfillment rates late in the quarter as well as our performance in dental.", "As noted by David, customer demand was strong in the quarter but certain aspects of our supply-chain integration impacted our ability to effectively respond to shifting product mix, most notably within our knee and hip portfolios. As a consequence, we underestimated demand for certain key cross-sell brands within our existing customer base leading to a depletion of our safety stocks and also affecting our ability to capitalize on new customer opportunities.", "We are working diligently to enhance our supply-chain processes and execution, particularly in the areas of demand forecasting, global inventory tracking and asset deployment systems while we replenish our safety stock levels. However, these issues have some carryover effect into the fourth quarter, which I\u2019ll address shortly in the context of our updated Q4 guidance.", "Turning now to the balance of our third quarter results, our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.1% for the quarter and 110 basis points lower when compared to the prior-year, due mainly to the impact of ASP declines, as well as lower foreign currency hedge gains, which we have been recently highlighting. The company's R&D expense was 5.2% of revenue at $95.6 million, reflecting investments from our recently acquired businesses, as well as our Zimmer Biomet Signature Solutions program.", "Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $727.7 million in the third quarter or 39.7% of sales which was 40 basis points higher than the comparable period in the prior year. As anticipated, ongoing investments in our specialized sales forces and medical training and education programs combined with the inclusion of our recent acquisitions offset the benefit of SG&A cost synergies in the quarter. We remain on track to deliver cumulative net EBIT merger synergies of $225 million by the end of 2016. In addition to the Biomet synergies, we are also laying the foundational elements for synergy capture in 2017 from our recent acquisitions.", "In the quarter, the company recorded pre-tax charges of $355 million in special items, primarily related to the Biomet and LDR acquisitions, including $181 million of non-cash amortization and inventory step-up charges as well as approximately $140 million of acquisition and integration-related expenses. Adjusted third quarter 2016 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these charges. A full reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning's press release. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to approximately $553 million or 30.2% of sales, which was a decrease of 200 basis points when compared to the prior-year period due to the reduction in gross margin, as well as expected impacts from acquisitions.", "Net interest expense and other non-operating expense totaled $94.6 million. Adjusted net earnings were $362.4 million for the third quarter, an increase of 7.1% compared to the prior-year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9.1% to $1.79 on 202.9 million weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding.", "Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.1% which reflects a year-to-date true up to recognize the tax benefit associated with the noted product mix shifts coming from tax efficient supply-chain jurisdictions as well as certain other items. Our year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate is 24%. ", "Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $353 million, which included $161 million of cash expenditures for acquisition costs, integration activities, and initiatives related to our synergy program. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $150 million, which included $94 million for instruments and $56 million for property, plant and equipment.", "Our free cash flow in the third quarter was approximately $202 million compared to $16 million in the third quarter of 2015. Ongoing working capital initiatives and improvements are expected to keep the company on track with full year cash flow generation of approximately $1.1 billion. During the quarter, the company repaid $200 million on our term loan, reflecting $700 million of debt repayment since the beginning of this year. Additionally during the quarter, the company consummated its new five-year $1.5 billion multi-currency senior credit facility along with a new $750 million term loan to finance the LDR transaction. As a result, gross debt increased by $550 million in the quarter.", "I would like now to review our guidance. As we look to the fourth quarter, revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 1.6% to 2.6%. Foreign exchange is estimated to decrease revenue by approximately 30 basis points. Therefore reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.960 billion to $1.980 billion. Fourth quarter constant currency growth on a day adjusted basis is expected to be in a range of 3.3% to 4.3%, or 1.0% to 2.0% excluding the contribution from LDR. ", "On a similar basis, the company had previously estimated revenue growth for the quarter in a range of 5.8% to 6.8%, or 3.5% to 4.5% excluding LDR. As a reminder, we have one less billing day as compared to the prior year. Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share on a fully diluted basis is now expected to be in a range of $2.08 to $2.13. ", "Turning to the full year 2016, we now estimate revenue to be in a range of $7.630 billion and $7.650 billion, or an increase of approximately 27% on a reported basis or 2.4% to 2.7% on an adjusted pro forma basis in each case as compared to the prior year. The adjusted pro forma revenue guidance range is inclusive of approximately 110 basis points of contribution related to the LDR transaction.", "We now expect foreign currency translation to decrease full year revenue in 2016 by approximately 30 basis points compared to our previous estimate of 50 basis points with the Japanese yen strengthening against the US dollar and a stabilized euro partially offset by the weakening British pound. Therefore full year revenue growth excluding the impact of the LDR acquisition on a constant currency adjusted pro forma basis is now expected to be in a range of 1.65% to 1.9%. Previously the company estimated full year revenue growth to be in a range of 2.5% to 3.0% on a similar basis.", "Turning to the full year P&L, after updating our assumptions to reflect our recent performance, acquisitions, a lower expected tax rate, as well as foreign currency exchange rates and the associated operating margin implications, our full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to be in a range of $7.90 to $7.95, an increase of approximately 15% over the prior year.", "Our full year reported earnings per share are expected to be in a range of $1.50 to $1.60 after giving effect to our year-to-date results and anticipated special items in the fourth quarter. Special items are largely associated with non-cash amortization, costs incurred to capture net synergy targets and acquisition-integration expenses. Finally please note that our guidance does not include any impact from other potential business development transactions or unforeseen events.", "With that, I will turn the call back over to David.", "David Dvorak", "Thanks, Dan. Although we were naturally disappointed with these third quarter results, I want to reiterate our confidence in Zimmer Biomet\u2019s market-leading and diversified portfolio as a driver of sustainable long-term growth. We are fully focused on restoring product supply and positioning our commercial teams to deliver on high market demand as we enter 2017. More broadly, we remain committed to creating meaningful partnerships to drive efficiencies across musculoskeletal healthcare with innovative technologies, services and solutions that improve the lives of patients. ", "And now I would like to ask Kareen to begin the Q&A portion of our call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.", "Bob Hopkins", "Hi, good morning. Can you hear me okay?", "David Dvorak", "We can Bob. Good morning.", "Bob Hopkins", "Good morning. So, thanks for taking the question. First a question for Dan and then a question David for you, so Dan, first just on the quantification side, can you give us a sense as to the impact of this sourcing supply issue on Q3 revenue growth and the anticipated impact on Q4 revenue growth and just maybe a sense of how long this will last into 2017, and does this impact earnings outlook for 2017 growth?", "Dan Florin", "Sure Bob. First with respect to the quantification of the impact as David said in his prepared remarks as well as mine very important to note that customer demand remains very strong. So that is a real positive and our current supply chain not being fully integrated did hamper our ability to respond effectively to this shifting product mix, and while not anticipated we understand the root causes, we understand the fixes that are necessary and we are highly confident in our ability to implement those changes.", "It will take several months to make those corrections. In terms of sizing impact for the quarter it is not a perfect science but I would roughly anticipate or estimate that to be about 100 basis points of impact due to the supply issues in the third quarter. We have a very robust backlog of demand and with respect to the impact in the fourth quarter I would size that even slightly above that 1% impact.", "Bob Hopkins", "Okay. And then just as a follow-up to start, does this compromise your ability to grow earnings 10% in 2017, and then David for you maybe just a little bit more color on when did this sourcing issue start to manifest and maybe just describe a little bit more exactly what this is, is it only in knees, why only in the US, just a little bit more detail would be really helpful. Thank you.", "Dan Florin", "I think Bob, the manifestation was really as the quarter progressed and late in the quarter the science became clear that we had a pretty significant product mix with the lack of visibility on a forward basis that allowed our supply chain to respond obviously if we fully integrate on the operations front. We're going to have a much more agile supply chain and be able to respond to these kinds of demands in a much shorter time period as we are in international state now, we just did not have the ability or the force side.", "So, part of this is forecasting systems part of it is just operational execution and lead times for these products but primarily driven by the large joint demand, if you think about the cross-sell product categories, you're going to be aligned with the biggest opportunities that we had. And probably on the forecasting side the most significant underestimation was the demand for those same products with existing customers. And so, it cost us to have the step back to make sure that we're redoubling our efforts to serve this existing customers and as we've referenced that took away from some of the authentive opportunities that we have.", "But please don\u2019t construe that to be a lack of demand. We know that we have significant opportunities to gain competitive accounts and business and as we restore the supply chain, we'll get after those opportunities and reaccelerate our top line momentum.", "And then Bob just coming back to your 2017, I would just say that 10% earnings growth in 2017 off of 2016 remains our goal.", "Bob Hopkins", "Just how long does this last into 2017, Dan, and that's my last question?", "Dan Florin", "I would see some tail effect into the first quarter of 2017, Bob.", "Bob Hopkins", "Okay. Thanks a lot for answering, thank you.", "Operator", "We'll move on to Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray.", "Matthew O'Brien", "Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just to follow up a little bit on Bob's question. Is it fair to say that this really is more focussed in just a few areas within large joints from a product perspective and you were seeing such demand for those products that you just weren\u2019t able to kind of meet that demand and as you were kind of integrating and seeing some of these sales disruptions that, that was really the issue or was it more broad-based kind of a cross different products?", "Dan Florin", "It was focussed on the key cross sell products very much. So if you think about the Persona system, the demand is very high for that system. The host of cross sell product opportunities that we have on the legacy Biomet hip portfolio, would be another significant example. And then the third category I would say to a lesser degree but still having an impact on the upper extremity side, the comprehensive shoulder system.", "So, those are all market leading systems and the demand within existing customers as well as competitive accounts is very strong.", "Matthew O'Brien", "Okay. And the as a follow-up. On the retention of business side of things, as we get into 2017. And I know you said the demand has been really strong for the products and you feel good about that but just now that you have this hiccup, how do you grab that momentum back which you were seeing and feel comfortable that you can get back to those kind of market growth rates you've been talking about in '17 and beyond.", "Dan Florin", "Yes. We're passively working towards addressing the supply issues and I would tell you that the forward visibility of addressing those supply issues combined with the known activities that we have on opportunities that we have for competitive accounts gives us that plan. And the confidence as we on our 2017 that we'll reaccelerate the top line.", "Matthew O'Brien", "Right. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll move on to Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.", "Mike Weinstein", "Thank you. Pardon me guys, that I'm still struggling a bit this so. David, explain to me why this wouldn\u2019t have been obvious until in the quarter?", "David Dvorak", "Yes. I think that the lack of visibility that we have with forecasting systems safety stocks were burning down. It just became a more profound issue as the quarter progressed. In retrospect we look back and we kind of understand why some of those demand signals weren\u2019t as timely but that's in retrospect. So, we just got to a point as the quarter progressed where we had the shift to limited supply both inventory and instruments to service existing accounts and it took away from the offensive opportunities that we could capitalize on, Mike.", "Mike Weinstein", "Okay. And so, sorry I can picture that that you're working down your excess by than you get late in the quarter and you're finding yourself short on product. But if the quantification is right and with a 100 basis points, that still suggests that overall it would have been light which you were expecting to do in the quarter. So, is the quantification accurate, do you think you would have been call it 2.5% organic head in this happen. And that's the case that it's obviously wasn\u2019t your goal for the quarter for the back half of the year.", "Dan Florin", "Yes, Mike, this is Dan. I think the other component was the dental performance in the quarter being below our expectation. And at our expectation level, you'd be 3% or thereabouts plus, had dental perform to our internal expectations. I think also with respect to the supply changes to indicate or give a little more colour on the fixes that are coming along. We've been integrating all the back office functions, the supply chain is extraordinarily complex. However, importantly we do have new tools coming online beginning this quarter with integrated global inventory data warehouses which did not exist at that part of the visibility fix that we lacked.", "We had some interim processes in place that enhanced. They were not as robust as we needed them to be. We also have integrated demand planning tools and production planning tools coming online next quarter. So, those are key foundational elements to the supply chain that are coming online and critical to the fix.", "Mike Weinstein", "That and Dan, just one question on the financial side. The tax benefit that we saw this quarter that got you to the EPS numbers, just what should we assume on tax going forward to that's the same amount.", "Dan Florin", "Mike, we're at 24% year-to-date. Embedded in our fourth quarter guidance is the tax rate that is just slightly below that and we absolutely believe that to be sustainable. And as we discussed, we see a path to further reduce that over the coming years.", "Mike Weinstein", "Understood. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "We'll move on to David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.", "David Lewis", "Good morning. I just had a few quick questions here. Dan, just to give the fourth quarter's sort of follow-on to Mike's question. We think about the fourth quarter guidance versus our expectations to sort of down two points. The supply chain is one point. To the incremental point of organic growth depression in the fourth quarter is that conservatism continuation to the dental trends. Can you just square the fourth quarter like you just did in the third?", "Dan Florin", "Sure, David. The 1% was the Q3 impact. The Q4 impact as I said is going to be above that, so think of that probably closer to 2% impact to the fourth quarter. So, I'd say that that\u2019s the quantification on the top line impact from the supply chain issues.", "David Lewis", "Okay. And then just two more quick ones. Then the third quarter, obviously margins were important in the stories in top 10% is the goal for next year. Gross margins were okay in the third quarter but obviously SG&A spending was higher. Can you just talk about again why third quarter margin compression was so severe and so what the implications are for the fourth quarter?", "Dan Florin", "Sure. I would say that in the third quarter, the SG&A margin which decreased or SG&A increased as a percentage of sale 50 basis points. You have to keep in mind the LDR acquisition and the impact of that. So, as David said, we're very pleased with the top line acceleration of Mobi-C. At the same time we've inherited the cost structure and as the team looked to integrate LDR in Zimmer Biomet spine, you'll begin to see leverage come from that integration that\u2019s not in the third quarter, you'll start to see that in the fourth quarter and certainly more significantly as we progress through 2017.", "So, that leverage from integrating our acquisition is a big contributor to the growth in operating margin next year. Combined with our other growth investments that we've been making during the course of the year, the medical training and education, the specialized sales forces which are driving that SET growth that David described. And then further investments in our Signature Solutions platform which David described as well all which are critical to long-term sustainable growth.", "David Lewis", "Okay. And then just one quick one for David. David, I am sorry to keep jumping back on this horse but it's -- was this a situation where you have a Zimmer business and a Biomet business, you have initiatives to shift that mix, and you so for example the Zimmer knee and a Biomet knee, at the end of the quarter more physicians than you expected for one knee over the other, I hate to oversimplify this, but I'm just trying to give a dearth to the sets of how this could happen and how it could happen quickly.", "And then related David, I would say how is your supply chain and manufacturing with critical parts at this merger. What could you say to investors that give them a confidence that you really feel this is an isolated issue? Thank you, I'll turn back in queue.", "David Dvorak", "Sure, David. It is very much the case where we underestimated the degree to which existing customers were ultimately going to be desirous of some of these key focus brands and for the reasons that we've outlined and the fixes that we have in place to address those issues that Dan just referenced for highly confident that we're going to be able to address those supply chain deficiencies and be able to get after the offensive opportunities with a new competitive business and accounts.", "So, I guess what I would want to focus you on as well, David, is that demand is a terrific problem to have. We're disappointed that we didn\u2019t foresee that demand because it's taken us away from being able to run the kind of offense that we would otherwise be able to run. But these aren\u2019t product GAAP issues. We've got an incredible portfolio and in the natural state of one of these integrations, a complex integration which we would of course seen this. We've got the right fixes in place to get after it. The supply chain will respond and we'll get back, in offensive mode as the month's progress here and have a high degree of confidence and the team's capability to swipe the opportunities that are out ahead of us.", "Operator", "We'll move on to Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, sir.", "Larry Biegelsen", "Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Can you hear me okay?", "David Dvorak", "We can.", "Larry Biegelsen", "Great. David, I heard you talk about accelerating growth in 2017. When do you expect to be back to market growth and that 4% target that as you laid out earlier this year and I had to follow-up. Thanks.", "David Dvorak", "Yes. We absolutely foresee at or above market growth in 2017 as Dan said. There is likely to be a little bit of a carryover effect of the supply challenges at the beginning of the year. But we would see the year progression quarter-to-quarter throughout 2017 and accelerating growth in light of effect that we will have these supply issues behind us. And we'll provide this specific guidance beyond that, Larry, when we get to the January call.", "Larry Biegelsen", "Perfect. And then on dental. Could you give us a little bit more colour on what the issues were? I know you had a recall in the past and you were supposed to return to growth in the second half, I think in 2016. And so, when do you expect to return to growth there and in the past you explore strategic alternatives for dental. Can you talk about whether that is still strategic or as in requirement? Thanks for taking the questions.", "David Dvorak", "You're welcome. We believe that there are good value creation opportunities within the dental market. As we've referenced in the past, strategically each of legacy Zimmer and Biomet have been focussed on the so called premium market and we have significant opportunities and we're working to develop the strategies and then execute those strategies increasingly to get after those various market segmentations including the value segment.", "As the business stands now, commercial execution is key. I would tell you that we had a pretty stable Q2 to Q3 performance within the America's had some drop off outside the United States. And so the team is very focussed on showing up the commercial execution on a global basis. We have a terrific regenerative portfolio for cross sell opportunities. And we would expect to see sequential improvement. I would anticipate that we get into a growth mode but not before 2017.", "So, we expect to see improvement sequentially from Q3 to Q4 and then get into a growth mode as we're on our 2017.", "Larry Biegelsen", "Thanks for taking the questions.", "David Dvorak", "Sure.", "Operator", "Moving on to Matt Miksic with UBS.", "Matt Miksic", "Hi, thanks. So, I had one question on the Medtech Robot platform. And then I'm sorry to say one follow-up on this inventory issue. But on Medtech, David, you mentioned positioning you to potentially explore other applications over time. Can you talk a little bit about where and when and how long something like that you think would take particularly on the large joint side if that's something that you're thinking about. And then as I mentioned I have a follow-up.", "David Dvorak", "Yes. The development of any applications for us Matt, on the minimally invasive technologies and soft tissue preserving technologies and the broader portfolio of intelligent instrumentation is going to be driven by proven clinical benefit in a cost efficient way that also addresses the provider's capability on throughput front. And so, those are really the three preconditions, any anatomical site is fair gain for that, but our broad portfolio of intelligent instrumentation puts us in a position to be able to bring the right technologies and converge the right technologies whether those are preoperative planning integrating and or interoperative execution set of technologies in an optimised way.", "So, this is a piece of the portfolio we think it will become an increasingly important piece of the portfolio but just a piece of the portfolio and we want to bring the right tool to address the issue in a cost effective way. So, as far as forecasting that out, we would expect continue to drive the convergence of these innovative technologies and in the operating periods to come at. And we give updates at appropriate points when applications are developed and gotten at the point where we're doing limited launches moving towards full launches of those other applications. Right now, the Rosa Robotics technology is focussed on brain and spine applications.", "Matt Miksic", "Okay. So, this isn\u2019t one of you competitors had a toning application they were working on and talking about probably for at about a couple of years before it finally began to reach the market. Should we sit in a -- do we not expect that kind of plan to land us -- to the pipeline for us a little bit?", "David Dvorak", "You shouldn\u2019t expect this to layout our internal innovation pipeline. That\u2019s right, Matt.", "Matt Miksic", "Okay, that's fair. I think I get that. So, on the not to kind of speed that works on this supply chain issue, but it has I don\u2019t think we've ever, I'm trying to think of an example that we see like this north be it. And you've managed to a number of large launches and ads and flows between preferred products before. Maybe I remember there was something about before the Biomet the others, something that you were tackling as on your supply chain kind of been a lean out working capital get more efficient.", "I don\u2019t know if this has anything to do with, greater reliance on preop planning and the visibility that gives in the supply chain. But is this get -- is this sort of an unfortunate consequence of some of your efforts to get more efficient and one step forward and we'll expect to, one step back and two steps forward. Or just some colour would be very helpful on how this how we got here.", "David Dvorak", "Yes. I understand your question, Matt. And I would tell you that it's much more simple than that. This is much more simple in regard to appropriate forecasting in having forward visibility. So, the system fixes and infrastructure that Dan referenced earlier during the call are the solutions here. It isn\u2019t driven at all by any kind of innovative go to market or demand signal and transformation, nor is it driven by any kind of consolidation of the portfolios in the form of rationalization.", "So, I wouldn\u2019t want people to misconstrue that the, yes it\u2019s a complicated operation because these are large product lines and manufacturing facilities. But there isn\u2019t anything other than blocking and tackling that fixes this problem we know we need to do to address it.", "Matt Miksic", "Okay, thank you.", "David Dvorak", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "We'll move on to Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Good morning. Can you hear me okay?", "David Dvorak", "We can, Joanne. Good morning.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. You were able to quantify the tailwind or the impact in the third and the fourth quarter, the commenting that is going to roll into the first quarter. How should we think about that quantification and is there an all clear signal where we don\u2019t have to worry about this anymore?", "David Dvorak", "Yes. We wouldn\u2019t expect it to accelerate as we move into next year. So, I think that that quantification that we provided as far as the Q4 impact would be the high water mark and expect it to dissipate as we move into in through 2017, Joanne.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Okay. And then it was mentioned if I recall, that the average selling price is or the price pressure may have been somewhat higher than normal during the quarter. Could you please address that?", "David Dvorak", "Yes. We just have a little bit of a not pick but consistent with expectations. Primarily as far as the geographic segments go and the America's and Asia Pacific. But nothing that we didn\u2019t anticipate coming into the year or nothing that we didn\u2019t anticipate even coming into the quarter. Part of that Asia Pacific uptick is obviously the biannual adjustments in Japan.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Okay. Thank you, very much.", "David Dvorak", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Matt Taylor with Barclays has our next question. Please go ahead.", "Matt Taylor", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me okay?", "David Dvorak", "We can, Matt. Good morning.", "Matt Taylor", "Good morning. So, I just wanted to understand from your customers point-of-view, elevated the supply issue that basically they're asking for inventory like Persona and you have to tell them that they have to wait a few weeks. Or can you help us characterize that so we can get the impact on your customers look the risk that you lose anybody because of the [indiscernible]?", "David Dvorak", "That risk will be minimised. I mean, this is part of the reason that has any of those signals we receive back we back off of some of the offense of deployments to make sure that we're taking care of the existing customers. So, that's the priority. It's a good question. And I would tell you that our entire organization is very focused on addressing any of those desires with the historic customers for the business side of legacy, Zimmer or Biomet.", "Matt Taylor", "Then on the fixes that you have with forecasting in the moment. Can you give us a sense of, what are the kind of long holes in the tent there. I like to give some upside or downside to your expectation, that will be $3 in a two months.", "Dan Florin", "Matt, this is Dan. If I mention some of the fixes being a global inventory data warehouse that is in user acceptance training as we speak. So, we expect that to come online in the coming weeks. That immediately gives us the type of global visibility to finish goods in inventory levels around the US and around the world. That's critical to that comes online in the coming weeks. The so I think we're very low risk of that going purely based on the testing that's been done today.", "The integrated demand planning tools come online shortly after the new year and based on the learnings over the past few months, needless to say a lot of focus on the process for that and then the deployment of these tools were we're deploying our approve tool. So confident that we're going to be able to get that up and running without a glitches. Importantly over the past month, we significantly ramped up production levels but given lead times from vendors and production lead times that just takes time to build inventory and replenish those safety stock levels. But all of the above were aggressively dealing with and have been for the past several weeks.", "Matt Taylor", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll move next to Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners.", "Richard Newitter", "Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just to turn away from the supply issues for a moment. You mentioned some initiatives to try to tell your solution a bit more to the bundle payments that we're seeing take hold of the CJR. You acquired this respond well business. Can you talk a little bit about how we can expect these types of solutions to just fit into your overall strategy and how we should expect them to generate sales or what the business model is there?", "David Dvorak", "Sure, we take the form of much broader and deeper partnerships with the hospital customers. And I would tell you the discussions that we've had which to-date have been focussed primarily on large academic institutions have been very positive. So, we would enter into a deep partnership that could include risk sharing in an appropriate manner to optimise the quality of care for patients. And as well address the economic pressures that are on these customers as they get transitioned over to a more value base system.", "To do that well, obviously, it requires an end-to-end management in the episode of care. And that's where the patient engagement tools become so important. Prehab is important, education, patient surgeon communications, obviously a really bright light has been shining as of late. Because of CJR, the post discharge cost that are incurred and that\u2019s where the teller rehabilitation and leveraging technologies that lead to a better patient outcome, but do that on a cost effective way can become so meaningful.", "So, that product portfolio across the continuum of care including these services and solutions including our couple of decades of experience through our Accelero consulting services that help lean out processes and ensure that the quality of care is raised and it's done efficiently and throughput is drive through these systems is what signature solutions is all about.", "And as I said, it\u2019s a message that's really resonating. I think they were in a unique position as we participate in over 1.5 million procedures across the globe on just the large showing side alone to understand what best practises can be transferred from one institution to another. And then ultimately with the appropriate structure on an end-to-end basis. We're going to be able to along with our hospital customers draw data that will lead to continuous improvement and refinements of how the care is delivered.", "So, we love the opportunity. We think that we can be a big part of the solution for the hospitals going forward. And the deeper partnerships in the Zimmer Biomet Signature Solutions is the umbrella that allows us to bring those solutions to the customers.", "Richard Newitter", "Okay. And just one follow up on LDR. I think Dan, you had mentioned, leveraging that acquisition into the fourth quarter in a more meaningful in '17 as a reason for confidence and operating profit growth through acceleration. I guess my question just there is, do you -- what's your confidence level that you're going to be able to maintain the salesforce in what always is tricky with spot acquisitions and what level of confidence do you have that we won't see any surprises kind of for that business to potentially alter that margin outlook. Thanks.", "Dan Florin", "Sure. And we will do nothing to impede the momentum of Mobi-C. We can assure you that the opportunity is really keeping mind that the Zimmer Biomet spine business still in the process of being integrated, you bring LDR into that and that and now we have an opportunity to further design the right or structure for robust growth in the right level of supporting infrastructure.", "So, it's really you have to think about Zimmer Biomet LDR all emerging together in from a back office perspective and so forth. But we will do nothing to impede the growth. In the LDR portfolio and then capitalize on the cross sell opportunities that exist between the Zimmer Biomet portfolio with Mobi-C. Very exciting and how the confident in our ability to drive the top line while delivering on the integration and the synergies.", "David Dvorak", "Cray, we have time for one additional question.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll take that from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.", "Glenn Novarro", "Hi. Two questions. One, back into the temper you guys were on the conference trail and you highlighted the FX headwinds for 2017 on the EPS line. So, can you give us an update on the FX impact in terms of EPS for 2017 and what are the offsets? And I have a follow-up.", "David Dvorak", "Sure, Glenn. The impact on 2017 is still the same and we've characterized that roughly in the neighbourhood of a 4% headwind to EPS growth next year. And that's still the case. We continue to feel good about the Biomet synergies which offset that. And then some of the other activities that will be driving to work towards that 10% goal that I described before. So, nothing had changed in that regard.", "Glenn Novarro", "Okay. And then, just on the salesforce back at AAOS, there was a lot of chatter about the Zimmer reps and resume's out in the field. But Dave, I think on the call you said that you were a mid-adder of sales reps this quarter. So, can you quantify and where is this coming. Is it coming particularly in knees and hips? Thanks.", "David Dvorak", "Sure Glenn. We have been a mid-adder as you said in the first quarter of this year, in the second quarter of this year and again in the third quarter of this year. And it's across all product categories Glenn, if there is a lot of focus obviously consistent with as we've been talking about building up the specialize salesforces and so the non-large showing categories as well had be recipients of the continuous filled out of the salesforce.", "And I think that you're just beginning to see the science of the productivity of those specialized salesforces is evidenced by the continued improvement of the SET category. And that was global improvement as is our build out of the specialized sale force, since it's very much a global offense and strategy.", "David Dvorak", "So, with that, I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today and for your continued interest and support for Zimmer Biomet. We look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter conference call. I'll turn the call back to you, Careen.", "Operator", "Thank you, sir.

(NYSE:ZBH) Q2 2017 Earnings Conference Call July 27, 2017  8:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Matt Abernethy - Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer", "Dan Florin - Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer", "Analysts", "Bob Hopkins - Bank of America", "Matt Taylor - Barclays", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "David Lewis - Morgan Stanley", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners", "Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo", "Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets", "Operator", "Good morning. I would like to turn the call over to Matt Abernethy, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. Mr. Abernethy, you may begin.", "Matt Abernethy", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Zimmer Biomet second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. I am here with our Interim CEO and our CFO, Dan Florin.", "Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties. Also, the discussions during this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, are included within the earnings release, which is available on our website at investor.zimmerbiomet.com.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Dan.", "Dan Florin", "Thanks, Matt. Before I discuss our results for the quarter and outlook for the remainder of the year, I want to take a minute to thank David for his contribution to Zimmer Biomet for the past 16 years. During David\u2019s tenure, the company became a global industry leader and made tremendous progress, establishing a world class portfolio of technologies, solutions and personalized services and we wish him success going forward. I am honored to serve as interim CEO as well as by this opportunity to lead such a talented and dedicated team. Since stepping into this role, I have been closely engaged with Zimmer Biomet\u2019s board, the management team, commercial leadership and other team members across the organization. While we have a lot of hard work ahead, I am encouraged by the team\u2019s commitment to ensuring that we capture the promising opportunities in front of Zimmer Biomet.", "With respect to the CEO search process, the board has retained a leading executive search firm to identify and evaluate external candidates for the permanent CEO role. That process is ongoing and the board is committed to moving diligently and swiftly. I have communicated to the board that I am committed to leading the company in the interim capacity as long as necessary.", "During the second quarter, we achieved net sales of $1.945 billion, an increase over the prior year quarter of 1.1%, which included approximately 240 basis points of contribution from the LDR acquisition. Our results were negatively impacted by approximately 100 basis points as a result of having 1 less billing day during the quarter. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 2.1%, including a solid 6.8% sales increase in our Asia-Pacific geography and 2.5% sales growth in the Americas. Our continued strong growth in the Asia-Pacific region was the result of focused commercial execution and a historically low level of product mix out of the Warsaw North Campus. Our sales in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region decreased 1.8% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year quarter. However, we recorded positive growth on a selling day adjusted basis.", "As we have highlighted previously, there are two primary factors that contributed to top line results being below our expectations. First, production delays within certain key brands impacted our ability to reduce back orders at the targeted rate. Second, sales recapture from previously affected customers in the United States was impacted by our delayed production output. As a consequence of lower than anticipated second quarter results as well as updated assumptions on production levels and sales recapture, we are revising our 2017 sales and earnings guidance, which I will detail later in my remarks.", "I would like to now spend a few minutes providing more detail on our key focus areas to address these challenges going forward as well as some of the initiatives already underway. During the quarter, we delivered production consistency with significantly less disruption than we saw in the first quarter. Notably, we delivered the highest quarterly output on record from our Warsaw North Campus manufacturing facility, allowing for some of our brands to achieve the full production levels that we had previously anticipated. However, reaching full production of certain brands has proven to be more challenging than initially anticipated due to the complexity of validating certain material types and production processes as well as ensuring quality control with regard to sourcing. This resulted in lower than anticipated supply availability of these brands during the second quarter and we have therefore updated our expectations for the second half of the year.", "We continue to make progress meaningfully reducing back orders on many of the brands manufactured at the Warsaw North Campus and we expect to continue building safety stock of these products through the third quarter. For those brands that were delayed in the second quarter, we anticipate that we will substantially reduce back orders through the third quarter and early into the fourth quarter. Importantly, we expect to reach sufficient safety stock levels across our entire portfolio as we exit 2017.", "Clearing back orders allows us to more fully meet the existing customer demand and we expect that achieving sufficient levels of safety stock will enable us to return to greater sales offense and bring on new customers. While we are disappointed that the timeline for recovery of certain product lines has extended beyond our initial expectations, our cross-functional teams continue to execute well and we are focused on restoring adequate supply in line with these new timelines. We continue to more broadly invest in manufacturing and quality enhancements across our entire network and I will address these investments in further detail when I review our financial performance and guidance.", "Now, turning to our sales recapture program, on prior calls, we have discussed headwinds associated with our ability to fully meet existing customer demand. These same factors carried into our second quarter. We still see an opportunity to recapture this business, but we expect that this will occur at a slower pace than previously anticipated as a result of the supply delays that I have described. We have established focused initiatives to deeply engage with our customers, sales forces and team members in order to more fully meet existing customer demand. Fully restoring product supply is the first step in this process, with enhanced commercial execution and customer engagement being the other key elements to our renewed growth program. We continue to make investments in and offer incentives to our sales forces and commercial team, enabling us to work closely with our customers and prioritize growth opportunities as we progress through the year and into 2018.", "Our global sales forces and team members have shown tremendous resiliency through these past several quarters and I am proud of their collective efforts. I can assure you that we are not going to stand still waiting for our new CEO to arrive. We know what we need to do and we have an incredibly talented team that wants to win. As we look forward, the clinical heritage of our products, our strong innovation pipeline and our best-in-class sales forces gives the board and our entire management team confidence in the promising opportunities in front of Zimmer Biomet.", "As I will discuss in a moment when I walk through our business results, we have delivered ongoing, market leading growth in the Asia-Pacific region and we have substantially completed our commercial integration with LDR Spine, both of which reinforce our confidence in the fundamental strength of our global business. We are confident in our ability to remedy recent challenges and are eager to get back on the offensive and do what we do best. As we continue to work through this process, we are approaching our challenges head on to ensure we get back on the right track. During the second quarter, we continued to observe steady market demand across the globe. With regard to pricing, we experienced negative pressure of 2.6% during the second quarter. The slight sequential increase in pricing pressure from the first quarter to the second quarter was attributable to certain markets in the Asia-Pacific region.", "Before I review our performance by category, I will remind our listeners that as previously mentioned our net sales were negatively impacted by approximately 100 basis points, resulting from 1 fewer billing day during the quarter. Our knee net sales decreased 1.3% from the prior year quarter, reflecting positive volume and mix of 1.5% and negative price of 2.8%. While we continue to achieve solid results in the Asia-Pacific region, supply challenges hampered our growth in the Americas as well as in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. By focusing on fully restoring product supply of certain brands manufactured at our Warsaw North Campus, along with the further development of our strong product pipeline, we are positioning the company for improved knee performance.", "During the quarter, our limited launch of the Persona Partial Knee received excellent early clinical feedback from surgeons. We expect to begin the full commercial launch of this product later this quarter. We have also continued to execute our Persona TM Tibia cementless knee and Persona revision development projects with initial launches expected in the second half of 2018. In support of our flagship total knee brands, during the quarter, we announced the commercial availability in certain European markets of our X-PSI guides, the world\u2019s first CE Mark surgical planning system that enables patient-specific implant positioning using a guide that is manufactured from 3D anatomic models generated from x-ray images. Importantly, this next generation system offers economic value in health care by replacing MRI and CT scans with standard x-ray technology.", "Turning to our hip category, our sales decreased 0.2% from the prior year quarter, reflecting positive volume and mix of 2.4% and negative price of 2.6%. We continue to see strong demand for the G7 Acetabular system, including our proprietary 3D printed OsseoTi Porous Metal Technology, as well as the Taperloc Complete Hip Stem and Arcos Modular Femoral Revision System, although these positive trends were offset primarily by supply shortfalls at the Warsaw North Campus. Additionally, we have received regulatory clearance in the U.S. to market our clinical graphics technology for femoroacetabular impingement. This platform enhances our hip preservation portfolio with 3D range of motion simulation software designed to inform treatment decisions.", "Turning to our S.E.T. product category, we delivered 3.6% year-over-year sales growth. This performance was driven in large part by our surgical business and sports medicine offerings such as Gel-One, Subchondroplasty and Quattro Link, as well as our A.L.P.S. Plating System within our foot and ankle portfolio. Our growth was partially offset by supply constraints on certain product lines. Fully restoring product supply remains a key priority, along with continued expansion of our specialized sales channels.", "Our second quarter dental sales decreased 5.7%, primarily due to headwinds in certain European markets where we restructured our dental sales organizations for long-term success. Importantly, we had positive dental sales growth in the United States during the quarter. We also recently appointed a new General Manager to lead our Dental business. Together with our focus on enhanced product positioning, targeted commercial strategies and strong execution, we believe that we will be better positioned for improved performance in this attractive market.", "Turning to our spine, craniomaxillofacial and thoracic category, sales increased 33.5% during the quarter. As in recent quarters, we continued to benefit from strong demand for the Mobi-C Cervical Disc. With the integration of our U.S. spine sales force now substantially completed, we expect to begin capitalizing on the significant cross-sell opportunities that the LDR combination provides. Among our craniomaxillofacial and thoracic offerings, we achieved another strong quarter of growth. We continue to be pleased with the ongoing sales of our SternaLock Blu and SternaLock 360 primary closure systems as well as the RibFix Blu Thoracic Fixation System.", "I will now turn to our other second quarter financial details before providing additional information relating to our third quarter and full year 2017 sales and earnings guidance. Our adjusted gross profit margin was 74.3% for the quarter and was 70 basis points lower than the prior year period, due primarily to the impact of price declines, additional manufacturing costs at our Warsaw North Campus manufacturing facility and lower gains from our cash flow hedging program, particularly associated with the Japanese yen and the euro. Our R&D expense was 4.6% of revenue at $90.1 million, consistent with the same period in the prior year. As previously highlighted, we continue to prioritize R&D spending on what we believe are the most impactful programs, including our important knee programs, robotic applications and Zimmer Biomet Signature Solutions, among others.", "Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $748 million in the second quarter or 38.3% of sales, 50 basis points higher than the comparable period in the prior year. The negative variance was driven by a full quarter impact from our 2016 strategic acquisitions, including LDR, Medtech, CD Diagnostics and others, which negatively impacted SG&A expense by 60 basis points. We also incurred higher freight costs in the quarter due to expedited product shipments and continued investments in our specialized sales force. These increases were offset in part by continued savings in various SG&A expense categories stemming from synergy capture initiatives.", "In the quarter, we recorded pre-tax charges of $331 million in special items, which include $192 million of non-cash amortization, inventory step-up and in-process R&D impairment charges, as well as $54 million of quality remediation expense and $85 million of integration expense and other items. Our diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.90 versus a loss of $0.16 in the prior year period. Adjusted second quarter 2017 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of the special items that I just mentioned. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to $613.5 million or 31.4% of sales which was 120 basis points lower when compared to the prior year period.", "Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.5%, a decrease of 520 basis points from the second quarter of 2016. The second quarter tax rate was consistent with previous quarter\u2019s guidance and is primarily due to the favorable resolution of various tax matters, which will have future benefits on our effective tax rate. Adjusted net earnings increased 4.3% or 9.7% excluding the impact of foreign exchange to $424.6 million for the second quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter increased 3% over the prior year period or 8.4% excluding the impact of foreign exchange to $2.08 on 203.7 million weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding. A reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning\u2019s press release.", "Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $440.5 million, which reflects $120 million of cash expenditures for our synergy program and quality remediation initiatives. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $116.9 million, including $86.2 million for instruments and $30.7 million for property, plant and equipment. Our free cash flow in the second quarter was $323.6 million, which was $63 million higher than the second quarter of 2016.", "During the quarter, the company retired a $500 million senior note, which matured in early April. Additionally, we fully repaid the $400 million drawn from our senior credit facility that had been previously used to bridge our senior note retirement. Therefore, when combined with our first quarter activities, gross debt reduction during the first half of 2017 was $650 million.", "I\u2019d like to now turn to our updated guidance. As a result of the previously described manufacturing remediation efforts related to certain brands manufactured at our Warsaw North Campus facility, as well as slower than expected sales recapture, primarily in the U.S., we are adjusting our third quarter and full year revenue and earnings outlook. For the third quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $1.815 billion to $1.845 billion, which reflects a negative impact from foreign exchange of 0.5%. On a constant currency basis, our growth rate is expected to be in the range of negative 0.5% to positive 1.0% inclusive of a 30 basis point contribution from the LDR acquisition, as well as an approximately 130 basis point negative impact from fewer billing days when compared to the prior year period. Therefore, our billing day adjusted growth rate excluding the contribution of the LDR acquisition is now expected to be in the range of 0.5% to 2.0%. This compares to 0.7% in the second quarter.", "Regarding the fourth quarter, based upon our current expectations for supply recovery and timing of sales recapture, we are anticipating a billing day adjusted growth rate in the range of 1.0% to 3.0% over the prior year period. Note that the projected weighted average billing day impact on our fourth quarter growth rate is a favorable 20 basis points and that we fully anniversary out of the LDR acquisition during the third quarter. Current foreign exchange rates would have a favorable impact of 80 basis points in the fourth quarter. Therefore, for the full year 2017, our estimated revenue growth is now expected to be in the range of 1.5% to 2.4% over the prior year. Foreign exchange is now expected to decrease revenues by 0.3%, a 90 basis point improvement from previous guidance as the dollar has weakened versus many currencies.", "Taken together, constant currency revenue growth over 2016 is expected to be in the range of 1.8% to 2.7%, inclusive of 120 basis points of acquired revenue from the LDR acquisition. In dollar terms, our full year 2017 revenues are expected to be in a range of $7.800 billion to $7.870 billion. Our expected dollar range is down from our previous guidance range of $7.835 billion to $7.915 billion, with favorable foreign exchange partially offsetting the reduction in our constant currency growth rate.", "Turning to projected full year 2017 earnings, we have three primary factors influencing our earnings for the remainder of 2017: the negative impact from lower sales expectations, continued investment in critical programs and incremental manufacturing costs from our Warsaw North Campus facility. Earnings impact from our lower sales expectations has a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability due to the operational sales mix, which is only partially offset by favorable currency adjustments versus our previous outlook. Additionally, we continue to invest in critical programs such as specialized sales forces, sales incentive programs, core R&D initiatives, including the knee and robot projects previously mentioned and sales support cost to maximize customer engagement. These investments are critical for long-term value creation for our company.", "Finally, we will continue to incur incremental manufacturing and distribution costs, primarily in the Warsaw North Campus facility. The expected negative impact of these costs on our full year 2017 earnings approximates $60 million, which is an increase of approximately $30 million versus our previous guidance. These increased manufacturing costs are expected to continue to have a negative impact on gross margin throughout 2018 until we implement more efficient and automated manufacturing and quality control processes.", "Special items for 2017 are estimated at approximately $1.235 billion. This is an increase of $30 million from our previous guidance and wholly attributable to non-cash write-offs of Biomet-related in-process R&D. We expect investments in our quality remediation program for 2017 to be consistent with previously stated amounts. We now estimate our full year 2017 earnings per share to be within a range of $4.15 to $4.35. Excluding the impact of amortization, inventory step up and special items, we are reducing our full year 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $8.20 to $8.30. This EPS range represents approximately 3% to 4% growth over prior year or 7% to 8% growth when excluding the impact of foreign exchange.", "Due to the negative impact of our operational results, we are revising our full year 2017 expected free cash flow range downward to between $1.100 billion and $1.300 billion. We expect to continue prioritizing our free cash flow in the second half of 2017 towards debt repayment, continuing our path towards our previously-stated leverage target of approximately 2.5x by the end of 2018. Our third quarter projected EPS is in the range of $0.60 to $0.70. After the elimination of amortization, inventory step-up and special items, our adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.72 to $1.77.", "Our third quarter and second half 2017 effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be in a range of 22% to 22.5% as we continue to execute important initiatives that will have permanent benefits to our future effective tax rate. Finally, please note our guidance does not include any impact from other potential business development transactions or unforeseen events.", "Before moving on to our Q&A, I would like to emphasize how pleased and enthused I am with the entire team\u2019s focus and effort since I stepped in to my interim role as CEO. We have much work to complete in the coming months, and I am encouraged by the commitment I am seeing across our global organization as we tackle these challenges.", "With that, I\u2019d like to open it up to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.", "Bob Hopkins", "Thanks and good morning. Can you hear me okay?", "Dan Florin", "Yes, Bob. Good morning.", "Bob Hopkins", "Good morning, Dan. So, two questions, one on 2017 and then one looking out a little bit. So first on 2017, just to be clear, so are you saying that the supply issues will be behind you exiting 2017? And then also in 2017, can you quantify the total incremental investment that you are making versus your previous guidance?", "Dan Florin", "Sure, Bob. First, with respect to the supply issue, we are saying that by the end of this year, we will have basically cleared back orders, restored safety stock levels to normal levels, which enables our sales force to not only fulfill existing customer demand, but also to start going after new business, which has been a missing piece of our performance. So certainly the expectation is that during Q3, as we have described, we will continue to make progress on all brands. There are these certain brands with more complex remediation and manufacturing processes associated with them, which will lag a bit, but even those certain brands we expect to be in a good shape by the end of 2017. The incremental costs and the changes compared to the prior guidance really has to do with the production costs that we are incurring in the North Campus. There is no change to the remediation cost and the programs associated with that. That remains at approximately $210 million here in 2017. So, the incremental costs to prior guidance that\u2019s included in our adjusted P&L relate to the manufacturing variances out of the North Campus and that\u2019s an incremental $30 million in this new revised guidance.", "Bob Hopkins", "Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then sort of the obvious follow-up to that is looking out a little bit longer term and how we should think about those incremental expenses, you are revising your 2017 guidance down, that\u2019s obvious in the press release. What I am curious about is do these investments continue into 2018? And when we preliminarily at least think about 2018, can you grow earnings high single-digits in 2018 or are these expenses going to kind of limit growth more to maybe mid single-digits in 2018, again preliminarily?", "Dan Florin", "Sure. So first, let me just talk a little bit about the production environment in the North Campus and what\u2019s driving those incremental costs and then what\u2019s the path to recovery, if you will, from a cost profile perspective. I think the way I would describe our approach with the North Campus production is to remediate first and optimize later. And so what I mean by that is we have certainly prioritized our remediation activities on the North Campus, per the commitments we have made to the FDA and we are operating that facility under what we call interim process controls. And I think it\u2019s important to realize that these interim controls include a significant number of manual production and quality control processes and monitoring systems and that\u2019s resulted in significantly higher variable costs of production. So, the end state solution is to implement processes with inherently more process capability and consistency and this will take some time. In addition, the lesson we have learned, we need to create redundant capacity in the network to avoid single points of failure with respect to customer order fulfillment.", "So as I said in my prepared remarks, the incremental costs will be with us through 2018. And as we think about 2018, we will provide the official guidance, of course, later this year. But I would describe it as this way, Bob. We are certainly prioritizing our investment to restore full product supply to make the progress we need on the production and quality enhancements that I have described and prioritizing investments to drive growth. Now that said, we do have levers available to us, value creation opportunities, whether it be in the COGS area or the SG&A area. But again, we are prioritizing our investments towards growth and production and quality enhancement. So, our goal will continue to be to have a levered P&L next year, growing earnings per share faster than sales, the details of that forthcoming however.", "Bob Hopkins", "Great. Thank you. I will get back in queue. Thanks.", "Dan Florin", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with Barclays.", "Matt Taylor", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, I guess I wanted to understand some of the assumptions in your 2017 guidance. You touched on a few of them in the prepared remarks in response to the first question. But can you talk a little bit more about your customer recapture assumptions and how you think the supply delays are impacting your ability to recapture customers? And maybe within that, what are you doing on the hiring front in terms of the sales force?", "Dan Florin", "Sure, Matt. So in developing our guidance, we have considered as best possible about the risks and opportunities. First and foremost, associated with the production, both volume and mix out of the North Campus to clear back orders and replenish safety stocks. The assumptions along the timing and success rate of recapturing lost business and the timing of going back on offense to bring on new surgeon customers have also been updated. They are inherently linked, of course, with production. Healthy product supply will ensure that we are not missing cases. And importantly, free up our sales rep time from being in the mode of case logistics experts to getting back on offense and winning, an important element that\u2019s one of those I would describe as indirect impacts of the supply issues. With respect to recapture, we are seeing instances where some surgeons are waiting to move their business back to us until they see a full product offering with a steady flow of supply for a period of time. So while we\u2019re getting healthy on certain brands of a particular family, if there is other sub-segments of that family that have not yet healthy on supply, we are seeing instances where the surgeon customer maybe waiting to flip the business back over to us. So that\u2019s why getting full supply across the full spectrum of parts is so critical to that recapture assumption.", "In terms of going back on offense, again, we\u2019ve been prioritizing existing customers and have not been able to bring in new customers to offset some of that natural churn of surgeon activity that takes place in the normal course of business. So bottom line, Matt, we are in the early stages of getting healthy on supply and then experiencing what that recapture rate looks like. What we are doing to ensure that the sales teams are ready to run with that full supply is looking at rolling in some incremental incentives on win back and growth. So that\u2019s all in motion. But really first and foremost starts with getting healthy on supply. And then lastly, with respect to the field force and headcount, we had another quarter of net positive adds in total to the sales channel.", "Matt Taylor", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And just one follow-up on the pipeline, you have a number of knee products and some other products like in shoulders that you have talked about launching over the next 18 months, let\u2019s say. How are these issues impacting those timelines, if at all?", "Dan Florin", "As you said, Matt, we have some critical new products that are in the pipeline, particularly in the knee portfolio that are going to fill critical gaps in the portfolio. And we will be launching the Persona Partial Knee, a full commercial launch, later this quarter. And just to remind folks, the Persona Partial Knee replaces the fixed bearing knee that had to be divested as part of the merger. So, that\u2019s an important segment of the partial knee market that we have not been participating in. The early clinical feedback on that product is excellent and we have high hopes for Persona Partial Knee. So again, that will launch later this quarter. We also called out the Persona TM cementless knee, again, a very important sub-segment of the knee market, a fast growing sub-segment of the knee market. So that will be launching in the second half of 2018. That brings with it impactful mix and new business opportunities. So that remains on track with that time frame as does the Persona revision in the pipeline, second half of 2018. We have been without a revision system to the Persona. That\u2019s a critical new product launch. The robotic application on the total knee application, that program, high priority program, we continue to move that forward in line with our original expectations. So broadly speaking, with respect to how we are prioritizing R&D resources, it is the case that we have had to move some engineering capability over towards the remediation program. What we have been doing is taking another look at the critical R&D list and focusing that list down, narrowing it to the most critical R&D programs and then ensuring that those critical programs are fully staffed, they have got full support of all supporting teams and driving those to keep those programs on track.", "Matt Taylor", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Dan Florin", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.", "Mike Weinstein", "Thank you and good morning, Dan. I was hoping you could spend a minute on a couple of items that you kind of briefly mentioned here. So, one was the incentive program you are putting in place for the existing sales reps to a) recapture accounts and b) go on the offensive. Is that program in place? Is that a 2018 program or is that something for the balance of the year?", "Dan Florin", "That program is for the balance of the year, Mike. I am not going to get into the details of it, but just broad strokes. I mean our existing comp program incentivizes growth, just to be clear on that. So what we are looking at is incremental incentives to make sure that the sales teams are again ready to run as full supply is restored. So, those are new programs that we will be rolling out that specifically reward growth and win back or recapture of lost business and with the full intention of restoring momentum in the field.", "Mike Weinstein", "Okay. And then the second item is you have commented on the call like you have in other calls that the net sales force is up globally. I know that you have been building out your dedicated sales force in new categories, where prior to the acquisition, Zimmer didn\u2019t have one. Can you just talk a little bit about where you are in that process in the various areas, obviously trauma, extremities?", "Dan Florin", "Sure, sure. So, the comment in terms of adds to the channel was a U.S. comment, but it holds true globally as well. So, it has been a key focus and remains a key focus for us, Mike, to continue to build out focused sales forces and specialized reps, particularly in categories in the S.E.T. category. So within surgical, throughout the \u2013 since the merger closing, we have been adding dedicated salespeople within surgical, that will continue. The surgical team continues to do an excellent job with some new products, an excellent job on commercial execution. Within sports medicine, the same playbook, let\u2019s add specialized sales reps that can focus on sports only. We have added reps along the way, and we will continue to add sports med reps throughout the future. The sports med category and then the trauma category and the extremities category, those three areas in particular have been impacted by the North Campus production disruption. So in general, it is clearly our intent to continue to build out and add more dedicated sales reps. We are pacing that as we sit here today in accordance with that supply recovery, but make no mistake, it\u2019s our clear intent to continue to invest in focused sales reps.", "Mike Weinstein", "And on the core recon sales force, what has the turnover looked like?", "Dan Florin", "Yes, the attrit rate is normal, Mike, with respect to everything the team has been through, I think is a remarkable testament to their belief in our portfolio and our belief and the belief that we are going to restore full supply. So I would describe that build as kind of normal course. The real incremental investments are in the specialized sales force. But the core recon sales force in the U.S. is stable. They are anxious to get supply, needless to say. And look, a big part of supply, whether it\u2019s the direct impact of supply or indirect impact of supply, the key next step is to, of course, get full supply and start restoring trust, trust within our sales force, trust within our surgeon base that they no longer \u2013 there is a day where they will no longer have to worry about product being available. And we know that day is coming. Again, we want to make sure we have the right people, the right quantities of people, the right incentives in place to catch that and run with it.", "Mike Weinstein", "Understood. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful, Dan.", "Dan Florin", "Thanks, Mike.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.", "David Lewis", "Hey, good morning. Dan, I want to focus on a couple of issues. The first is visibility. The second is on some of these costs that you walked through. So can we just talk about visibility into the back half of the year? I guess specific question is your third quarter guidance doesn\u2019t imply much improvement when you sort of adjust for the comp. So how does that fit with sort of moderately improving supply dynamics into the third quarter? But as you look into the fourth quarter, you actually do get that acceleration in momentum. So I guess the question is, why don\u2019t you see it in the third quarter? And frankly, what\u2019s your visibility in that more material fourth quarter acceleration? How confident are you in these numbers?", "Dan Florin", "Sure, David. As we look at the recovery on supply, one of the real lessons in Q2 and we have brought this \u2013 these learnings into Q3 and Q4 is the importance of having the full bag ready to go. And I mentioned before that again, it\u2019s early days but there is some indication that surgeons maybe waiting to give us back our Vanguard business, for example, until we have all variants of Vanguard ready to go. And while we are healthy in many brands, there are other brands that are lagging behind. So the approach we have taken with this guidance to account for kind of the state of the state or the dynamics that we are dealing with is number one, we have broadened the range as you see from what we have done historically. And we have looked at the timing of getting healthier across all those brands. And that\u2019s \u2013 so that\u2019s what we have contemplated in the Q3 guide. So even though the comp is easier year-on-year, the business momentum is built on a sequential go forward basis and that\u2019s how we have approached Q3, again, with a wider range, the 0.5% to 2% pegged against what we just did at 0.7%. So, that\u2019s reflective of the pace of production, the mix, the recapture. And all of our dashboard clearly indicates that we expect all brands to be healthy mid-Q4, which again enables not missing existing accounts or cases and going back on offense and acquiring new business. So I think the bottom line is that we firmly believe in the opportunity that\u2019s still there, David and our guidance for the back half reflects some momentum building throughout the second half. And we have widened the range from where we have been before just to account for the dynamics. So, on the upper end of that guide, that\u2019s indicating that we land the production volume and mix, the sales force catches it and runs and executes really well.", "David Lewis", "Okay. So in the interest of not being cute, it\u2019s sort of if you build it, they will come, you are building in the third quarter and the customers come back in the fourth. Does that sort of paraphrase it?", "Dan Florin", "I mean, we are still looking to win business during Q3, David. So \u2013 but to your point, it\u2019s certainly a more modest growth rate relative to what we expect in Q4. So yes, we will be building momentum through Q3 and start really landing those \u2013 that new business in Q4.", "David Lewis", "Okay. And then just on cost, Dan, I wanted to \u2013 I know you talked about these things sort of broadly, but I want to see if we could pencil you again on sort of what these costs are. And obviously, we don\u2019t have all the math here. But if at the midpoint, you are lowering kind of $0.30 and maybe $0.10 of that is the adjusted for selling day revenue reduction, I kind of come up with $0.20 of sort of underlying reinvestment, so that\u2019s about $60 million or so. Is the way to think about that $30 million of sort of gross margin from the plant and then $30 million of sort of SG&A reinvestment? And if I think about those two buckets, Dan, how do those play out in \u201818? Do we still have the $30 million of gross margin expense through the end of \u201818, but we sort of get back some of that $30 million SG&A reinvestment? Thank you.", "Dan Florin", "Sure, David. I think the \u2013 just listening to your question, I think the math around the revenue takedown is off a bit. Now and it\u2019s really because when you think about the revenue takedown is really skewed towards some of our most profitable products and really concentrated in the United States. So the drop-through to EBIT on that revenue takedown is more significant than what you are modeling there. So, it\u2019s clearly well above our corporate average, in other words. So I think that\u2019s, for modeling purposes, something to take into account. And that\u2019s a takedown for all the reasons that we have described that we expect that to turn around. So, as we think about through 2018, recovering that growth particularly in the United States, the drop-through on that turns back around, right. So that comes back in our favor in 2018 as we restore momentum in the U.S. channel. So, that\u2019s a big element in terms of the EPS takedown. The variances as described, a total in the 2017 P&L, it\u2019s a total of about $60 million that\u2019s in the P&L from a variance perspective, an incremental $30 million, thinking about that next year that \u2013 assume that, that\u2019s in the P&L next year. So then back to your question about what other levers do we have, we want to make these investments whether they are incentives or training and education programs, sales support costs, keeping these critical R&D programs moving ahead as well. As we exit this year and think about guidance for next year, we have a line of sight to additional levers to pull on. Of course, I have a point of view on that. When the new CEO comes in, I will review that with the new CEO and we will decide how we want to approach 2018 from a reinvestment perspective.", "David Lewis", "Okay, thanks, Dan.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Good morning and thank you so much for taking the question. Understanding that all of the changes that have happened regarding your CEO search are relatively fresh, do you have a sense of timing? Do you internally or does the board internally have a view towards, okay, we should probably be doing this before year end or something of that sort?", "Dan Florin", "Sure, Joanne. As I said in the prepared remarks and in our release, the board has retained an executive search firm, so that firm is now in place. As described, the board is looking for a proven growth-oriented leader with a strong background both operationally and strategically. So clearly, we are moving forward with a sense of urgency, but there is no defined timetable. The board is willing to take its time to find the right candidate. So that\u2019s really the \u2013 that\u2019s the plan and we are off to a strong start.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Okay. And then to get into some more of a line item idea, can you discuss what\u2019s happening in your spine business? It\u2019s a little over a year since you purchased LDRH. That appears to be integrated. But what is going on in broadly the spine market and your business within it? Thank you.", "Dan Florin", "Sure. So, I think importantly, you are right, we have anniversaried here in July with the acquisition of LDR. The commercial integration, meaning the sales force integration of that channel is largely complete. And similar to the orthopedic sales channel, that\u2019s a critical \u2013 it\u2019s a critical asset. It\u2019s a critical part of the integration and getting that right is mission-critical. It\u2019s taken us the full year to do that. I think in the past, we have described how we have oriented the channel to make sure that we have full coverage of our full spine portfolio. So we have got representation across the full surgeon base. The Mobi-C product line continues to perform exceedingly well. We have very high hopes for Mobi-C. It\u2019s clearly a differentiator. The non-Mobi-C part of the portfolio has been challenged with the integration. So, there has been some level of dis-synergies as we have been integrating the channel. So, our expectations \u2013 with the channel complete, our expectations is that in the fourth quarter of this year, we have a global spine business on an apples-to-apples basis that\u2019s growing and contributing to overall Zimmer Biomet growth.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Thank you very much.", "Dan Florin", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners.", "Richard Newitter", "Thanks for taking the questions. Dan, the first one is on the recapture side and then my second one is on the manufacturing. On the recapture, you indicated that \u2013 well, I was hoping you could just breakout for us, of those customers that have been supply impacted, what percentage are in this kind of, we want to come back, but we want to wait for a thorough portfolio availability versus those that you have identified that are probably kind of trialed and out of the Zimmer camp?", "Dan Florin", "Rich, it\u2019s still really early days to fully know the answer to that question. I will just say that we have clear line of sight to the surgeon level in terms of where we have been gaining business, where we have been losing business, surgeons that have been added to the funnel or lost, so to speak, in the funnel. So, clear line of sight to where that business and opportunity is. So, without getting into the weeds on that, we still have high confidence that surgeons again want to use our product. We have described it as the broader issue is the case where surgeons have moved some of their business to a competitor, because of our inability to fully supply them. So we are referring to that as kind of borrowed market share. So, our ability to recapture that is critical. We are still confident we are going to be able to do that with a full supply. And again, that aspect of being on offense is a critical part of the growth and momentum story as well, just making sure that we are able to attract new surgeons while at the same time serving existing customers.", "Richard Newitter", "Okay, thanks. And then in response to an earlier question, I think it was David\u2019s question, what gives you confidence kind of in the ramp or what maybe you miscalculated when you gave guidance on the manufacturing remediation efforts and where you would be by the second quarter into the third quarter last time? It sounded like it was a little bit more you maybe miscalculated this issue of what it would take for customers who wanted to come back online to actually come back online. That seems more on the demand side. But on the manufacturing side, you are also running a little bit behind your schedule. So I guess my question is why should we have confidence that you are kind of \u2013 by end of 4Q 2017, these manufacturing issues are behind you, where you kind of had that timeline planned out before? Has anything changed in your planning processes, the team that\u2019s in place that\u2019s overseeing this? What can you say to give us confidence that you have got the right kind of target here?", "Dan Florin", "Sure, sure. We have obviously been learning a lot through this, okay. I described before the approach to the North Campus is first and foremost to remediate the plant and then to optimize it. I think just taking a step back a little bit, just to remind people that the Biomet Warsaw facility has historically had an excellent FDA track record, producing products for decades with a strong and lengthy clinical heritage. And the plant has operated in a particular manner for decades, with established manufacturing and quality processes. And look, we are on a journey to remediate those processes and also raise the plant up to more contemporary quality standards. And without a doubt, the journey has been more complex than we anticipated. So I think I want to acknowledge that due to the ongoing remediation work and interim process controls in the North Campus, of course, there\u2019s some risk of future disruption in production. We believe we have a strong grasp on the issues, Rich, and we\u2019re implementing the appropriate solutions. We are running the plant under these interim controls with more manual production and quality control. So kind of the inherent risk is above normal. And I think we\u2019ve learned from that. Our updated timetables, I believe, account for that as we look through the journey in the back half of the year. And there is \u2013 we have made changes from a personnel perspective. I believe strongly we have the right team in place with the right focus and the team is doing everything possible to meet these revised dates.", "Richard Newitter", "Thank you.", "Dan Florin", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.", "Craig Bijou", "Hi, guys. It\u2019s Craig on for Larry. Thanks for taking the questions. I want to start with top line growth progression. Obviously, Q3, you expect an acceleration, Q4, an acceleration on \u2013 the sequential acceleration on top of Q3. So just want to think about 2018 and is that 2% the right way \u2013 could it be thought of as a jumping off point for 2018? And then also just wanted to see, is 4% that you have mentioned before, before some of the production issues, is that still the right long-term target growth for the company?", "Dan Florin", "Sure, Craig. We absolutely believe 4% is the right long-term top line growth rate for the company. The Q4 range of 1% to 3%, the high-end of that range says that we have executed commercially and manufacturing wise in the right manner. That opportunity exists to exit in that, take the midpoint, 2%, to your point. So, the path to 4% is absolutely clear to how we deliver that. And it first and foremost starts with better performance in the U.S. with respect to hips and knees. And again with full supply, with a sales force ready to run, that\u2019s our goal through 2018. And the importance of the new product flow that\u2019s going to be coming into that channel starting later this quarter with Persona Partial Knee and then the cementless and revision Persona coming later next year is an important part of that. You combine that momentum with the S.E.T. category, a spine business, as I said that we expect to contribute to growth in the fourth quarter and carry that momentum into 2018. So 4% is clearly the goal. We still believe that\u2019s very achievable. One other point with respect to production feeding that and the North Campus is I just want to make the point about the importance of the buffer inventory that we will be building in the back half of this year and how important that is to restoring trust in the channel. With safety stock inventory or buffer inventory, that really does protect the field from disruptions from a production perspective. So that\u2019s why we have been so focused on clearing back orders, building safety stock, getting back on offense. That safety stock buffer is a critical part of the equation.", "Craig Bijou", "Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And as a follow-up, Dan, you have talked about the spine business quite a bit. And with the management change upcoming with respect to the spine business and the dental business, I just wanted to see if there is any change in strategy going forward. I know at times, there has been discussion about potentially divesting the dental business. So, just wanted to get a sense for if there is any change in the spine or dental strategy?", "Dan Florin", "Craig, I would tell you that our strategic priorities and objectives are unchanged, accelerated top line growth with full product supply and with strong commercial execution, while at the same time making progress on our production and quality enhancement program and then moving ahead with the critical R&D programs that we have talked about. Management and the board frequently discuss and evaluate many strategic alternatives: divestiture, acquisitions, adjacencies, focusing on what would deliver long-term value to shareholders. So, that\u2019s always the conversation. We believe in the spine and dental markets. The spine market, again, we believe we are going to be growing in that market in Q4. We are very excited to have the LDR portfolio as part of that business. The dental side, as we have described, dental did decline in the quarter. That actually was consistent with our internal expectations for Q2. That was really tied to disruption in our European commercial organization as we reposition that for long-term growth. Importantly, the U.S. had a positive growth quarter, the first one in quite some time. So that\u2019s very encouraging. As we have described previously, Craig, we like the dental market. We estimate that market growing 3% to 5%. The business provides an attractive return on invested capital. We need to get it growing. We are making adjustments to the portfolio. We have just hired an excellent leader for the dental business. And as we sit here today, we believe in the market and our ability to restore momentum in the dental market.", "Craig Bijou", "Great. Thanks for taking the questions.", "Dan Florin", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Matt Abernethy", "Lauren, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.", "Glenn Novarro", "Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Hey, Dan. Can you just give us a quick update on how the dialogue is going with the FDA regarding the 483s on the North Campus? There are a number of 483s. Where are you in kind of the remediation effort, kind of checking the box off on the observations? And it seems to me though that even with all the observations, you are still going to be getting approval out of these facilities given the timelines you have given, for example, on some of the Persona products. So that\u2019s my first question. And I had a quick follow-up.", "Dan Florin", "Sure, Glenn. We continue to communicate with the FDA regarding the status of the corrective actions and remediation work for the North Campus. So, that process is ongoing. The team is making excellent progress, consistent with our responses to the 483s. And we will keep all stakeholders up-to-date with appropriate disclosures in our periodic filings. Sorry, go ahead.", "Glenn Novarro", "Well, I was going to say at this point, one of the concerns we often hear from the investors is could this lead to a warning letter? Can you comment on your thoughts there?", "Dan Florin", "It\u2019s hard to predict, Glenn, what the ultimate outcome is. We continue to communicate with the FDA on the progress we are making towards that remediation plan that we have detailed out. So we are kind of heads down, executing that remediation plan and moving forward.", "Glenn Novarro", "Okay. And then just my last follow-up, you talked about supply constraints in the S.E.T. segment. Are those products coming out of the Warsaw plant or is this a different plant?", "Dan Florin", "No, they are coming out of the North Campus, the Biomet Warsaw facility. So specifically, across legacy Biomet sports medicine, legacy Biomet extremities, upper extremities and then certain trauma products are \u2013 come out of that North Campus. So yes, that is impacting the S.E.T. growth rate on a temporary basis.", "Glenn Novarro", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Dan Florin", "You\u2019re welcome, Glenn.", "Dan Florin", "So thanks, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today and we look forward to giving you an update on our progress on our third quarter conference call.

I would like to turn the call over to Matt Abernethy, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. ", "Mr. Abernethy, you may begin you call.", "Matt Abernethy", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Zimmer Biomet\u2019s Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. I am here with our Interim CEO and our CFO, Dan Florin.", "Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties. ", "Also, the discussions during this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, are included within the earnings release found on our website. ", "In addition to the earnings release issued this morning, we have also posted a quarterly presentation on our website at investor.zimmerbiomet.com, to supplement the content we will be covering this morning. ", "With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over Dan.", "Dan Florin", "Thank you, Matt. Our third quarter results fell short of our expectations, driven by external and internal factors. These factors included softened domestic market conditions, the impact of the hurricanes and the Indian knee price reduction, as well as the pace of our supply recovery and the related delay in sales recapture within our U.S. business. We know that Zimmer Biomet can and must perform at a higher level and significant work continues to ensure that we deliver on our commitments to our customers and our stockholders. ", "During today\u2019s call we will provide our insight into what drove the sales and production shortfalls within our U.S. business. In addition to our detailed plans to get our performance back on track, we will also provide an update on our production and sales recapturing initiatives to improve our near and long term results with respect to our U.S. business. Finally, we will discuss U.S. market conditions and our global performance by product category.", "First, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the communities affected by the devastation of hurricane Harvey, Irma and Maria. We are thankful to report that all of our team members in the affected regions are safe. During the third quarter our revenue was impacted by these storms, resulting in approximately $5 million of headwind. ", "Regarding our production at our Puerto Rico facilities, where we primarily manufactured some hip and trauma products, like many, we have encountered problems of mainly consistent power causing a more gradual return to full production than originally anticipated. Given the continued instability of infrastructure in Puerto Rico and current safety stock levels, we now expect some minor sales disruption in the fourth quarter and into 2018. ", "Additionally, the government of India initiated a significant knee price adjustment during the quarter. This action has caused much disruption in the India market, resulting in a headwind of $5 million for the third quarter. ", "Turning to our results, we achieved net sales of $1.818 billion excluding approximately 30 basis points of contribution from the LDR Holding Corporation acquisition. Third quarter 2017 revenues decreased by 1.1% from the third quarter of 2016, representing a decrease of 1.5% on a constant currency basis. ", "Our results were negatively impacted by approximately 130 basis points due to having one less billing day through the quarter. On a constant currency basis, our Asia Pacific sales increased by 5.2%, while sales in the Europe, Middle East and African region decreased by 0.4% and sales in the Americas decreased by 3% compared to the prior year quarter. ", "Let me now take you through our plans in greater detail. During the third quarter we made good progress in the execution of our quality remediation plan at the Warsaw North Campus and we remain on track to achieve the key milestones laid out in our Form 483 responses provided to the FDA in December 2016. These efforts will continue through 2018 as we have previously highlighted and will remain a key focus of our entire company. ", "On the production front at our Warsaw North Campus, we achieved lower than anticipated production output of several key brands due to inconsistent yields from certain more complex manufacturing prophecies, as well as increased attrition beginning in August among our temporary direct labor workforce in Warsaw. This resulted in third quarter output being below our targeted level. . ", "Reaching targeted and consistent output for certain manufacturing prophecies has proven difficult due to the added quality compliance measures, including in-process monitoring implemented as part of our remediation plans. Given these challenges we have accelerated our planned dual sourcing strategy for the previously mentioned manufacturing processes, which we expect will provide additional capacity starting in the second quarter of 2018. ", "Within the current manufacturing environment we continue to make ongoing engineering process improvements, including targeted investments into equipment and key technical expertise to improve process constancy and output. ", "As it relates to staffing, we have implemented new strategies to provide resource stability for the Warsaw North plan, including temp to direct hiring, to ensure we attract and retain the required skilled labor in Warsaw. ", "We remain intently focused on resolving these challenges. For brands not impacted by the previously described process complexity, we expect to clear back orders and replenish safety stock consist with prior expectations, resulting in full supply by the end of the fourth quarter. For those brands attached to the more complex processes, we expect both backorders and safety stock levels to improve over the coming quarters, achieving full supply on all products during the second quarter of 2018. ", "I would now like to turn to our sales recapture program in the United States. The production shortfall is directly impacting our ability to fully meet case demand and go on offence. During the third quarter we continued to experience low inventory levels across key brands within our knee, hip and S.E.T categories. Supply is the foundation to enable our sales recapture program and as supply improves, we expect the logistical burden on our sales forces to decrease, allowing us to better serve all of our customers and go back on offence. ", "During the interim, our sales forces has focused on products that have not been impacted by temporary supply challenges, such as our market leading Persona Knee System, which recorded strong growth during the quarter. We also launched our Persona Partial Knee System, which is realizing positive momentum due to encouraging market acceptance. ", "In addition, we have enhanced our customer engagement and responsiveness with chartered internal teams to ensure customers are bring appropriately communicated with as we work through production and supply initiatives. We also continue to make investments into our specialized sales forces and sales rep incentive programs to accelerate growth. ", "Our global commercial organization and team members worldwide have shown tremendous resiliency and I am proud on their hard work and dedication. We know what we need to do and our team is working diligently to achieve our objectives. While the pace of our production and sales recovery has not met our expectations, I am encouraged by my interactions with many of our surgeon customers who continue to place their confidence in our portfolio, our pipeline and our people. ", "As I alluded to earlier, a number of factors in the Musculoskeletal Market have impacted our results, including the previously mentioned effect from the hurricane and the knee price action by India. Further, we saw moderate step-down in knee and hip procedural volumes in the United States. Based upon those who have already reported, we estimate that third quarter U.S. Knee and hip market to be flat to positive 1% on a day adjusted basis, which was lower than our expectations.", "These quarter-to-quarter market fluctuations appear to have driven by U.S. insurance dynamics causing more variability in the timing of procedural volume and contributing to our lower than anticipated third quarter sales. We view these market fluctuations as temporary and believe underlying market demographics point to a sustainable global knee and hip market growth rate up between 2% and 3%. With regard to pricing, we experience negative pressure of 2.1% during the third quarter. ", "Turning now to performance by product category, as a reminder the growth rates I quote are on a constant currency basis and have not been adjusted for the 130 basis point impact from one less billing date during the quarter. ", "Our third quarter knee sales decreased 1.7% from the prior year quarter, reflecting positive volume and mix of 0.8% and negative price of 2.5%. We continue to drive strong knee growth in the Asia Pacific region, where we generated approximately 4% constant currency sales growth, inclusive of the effects of the price action in India. We were also pleased with our sales results in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. ", "In the Americus our knee franchise was impacted by a softened U.S. market, as well as the headwinds I mentioned earlier related to supply shortfalls, which limited our ability to accelerate revenues. As we continue to work aggressively on resolving these near term challenges, we remain focused on a number of important development products to drive future growth. ", "As I mentioned earlier, in September we announced the launch of the Persona Partial Knee system, which provides us with the ability to participate in the important fixed bearing segment of the partial knee market and complements our clinically trusted Mobile Bearing Oxford Partial Knee. ", "The Persona Partial Knee also represents our first significant jointly developed new products since the Zimmer Biomet combination. We also continue to make steady progress towards the planned launch of our Persona TM Tibia Cementless Knee and the clinical evaluation of our Persona Revision system in the second half of 2018, as well as the clinical evaluation of our ROSA robotics platform for knee replacement application. ", "In addition to these development projects, after reaching the milestone of over 500,000 Persona Knee procedures, our knee teams showcased the clinical success and versatility of our Persona Knee system to hundreds of surgeons at a global webcast surgical education event. The webcast was very well received and provided continued optimism for the future success of our Persona platform. ", "Third quarter hip sales decreased 1.7%, reflecting positive volume and mix of 0.8%, a negative price of 2.5%. While we continue to achieve solid sales of our G7 Acetabular System, our Taperloc Complete Hip Stem and Arcos Modular Femoral Revision System; our hip performance remained challenged by supply constrains. As we focus on fully restoring production levels and closely engaging with accounts impacts by the temporary supply disruption, we will continue to pursue improved growth across our comprehensive hip portfolio, along with several important development projects. ", "Now turning to our S.E.T product category; revenue increased by 1.1% over the prior year quarter. Our specialized sales forces delivered solid sales of our Gel-One and Subchondroplasty treatments, as well as our Quattro Link Knotless Anchors, the A.L.P.S. Total Foot System and our IntelliCart System for fluid waste management. ", "Our surgical team had another quarter of strong execution and sales growth as a result of their dedicated sales channel and broad product offering. However, our overall S.E.T sales growth was challenged due to supply constraint that limited our ability to drive offense within our Sports Medicine, Extremities and Trauma portfolios. We remain focused on restoring supply levels across the entire range of our S.E.T offerings. In addition, we plan to introduce several new products in 2018, including our comprehensive Shoulder Augmented Baseplate, as well as a Stemless Shoulder offering, which we expect to be important growth catalyst. ", "Our third quarter dental sales decreased by 4.4%. We continue to restructure our dental sales organization, specifically in some key Western European markets, which we expect to positively impact sales performance in 2018. Our dental business remains focused on executing both commercial and portfolio initiatives to shape the business for sustainable long term growth. ", "Revenue from our Spine, Craniomaxillofacial and Thoracic category increased by 0.3% over the prior year quarter. We continue to belief from sales of our market leading Mobi-C cervical disc, however our spine performance came in below our internal exceptions due to near term revenue dis-synergies related to the commercial integration of our U.S. spine sales force. We are working diligently to mitigate these disruptions and to enable optimal cross selling through increased training and investment into working capital. ", "Among our Craniomaxillofacial and Thoracic offerings we achieved another solid quarter of growth, supported by sales of our Trauma One Plating System and SternaLock Blu and SternaLock 360 primary closure systems, as well as our RibFix Blu Thoracic Fixation System.", "I will now turn to our third quarter financial details before providing additional information related to our fourth quarter sales and earnings guidance. Our adjusted gross profit margin was 73% for the quarter and was 210 basis points lower than the prior year period, due primarily to lower gains from our cash flow hedging program, additional manufacturing costs at our Warsaw North Campus manufacturing facility and the impact of price declines. ", "Gross margin was lower than anticipated, due primary to regional and product mix of our third quarter revenues. Our R&D expense was 5% of revenue at $91 million, a slight decrease from the same period in the prior year. We continue to prioritize R&D spending on what we believe are the most impactful programs, including our important knee programs, our robotic applications novel case fulfillment approaches and Zimmer Biomet Signature Solutions among others.", "SG&A expense was $695 million in the third quarter or 38.2% of sales, 150 basis points lower than the comparable period in the prior year and consistent with 2017 trends. ", "In the quarter we recorded pretax charges of $328 million in special items, which include $188 million of non-cash amortization, inventory step-up and a good will write-off related to one of our small non-core businesses. Special items also included $50 million of quality remediation expense and $90 million of integration expense and other items. ", "Our diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.48 versus $0.78 in the prior year period. Adjusted third quarter 2017 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of the special items that I just mentioned.", "Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to $542 million or 29.8% of sales, which was 40 basis points lower when compared to the prior year period, driven by the previously described gross margin decline, partially offset by SG&A improvements.", "Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was in line with our expectations at 23.2%, an increase of 210 basis points from the third quarter of 2016. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter decreased 3.9% from the prior year period or negative 0.6% excluding the impact of foreign exchange to $1.72 on 204 million weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding. A reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning\u2019s press release.", "Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $463 million, which reflects $111 million of cash expenditures, primarily for quality remediation initiatives and integration activities. Free cash flow in the third quarter was $344 million, $142 million higher than the third quarter of 2016.", "During the third quarter the company paid down $490 million from our term loan and increased our borrowings by approximately 21.3 billion yen for our Japanese loan vehicle. Therefore when combined with our activities for the first half of 2017, gross debt reduction during 2017 has been $950 million.", "I\u2019d like to turn now to our updated guidance. As a result of the previously described pace of supplier recovery of certain key brands manufactured at our Warsaw North Campus facility and the related impact on sales recapture, primarily in the U.S., we are adjusting our fourth quarter and full year revenue and earnings outlook. ", "For the fourth quarter we expect revenues to be in the range of $2.10 billion to $2.50 billion, which includes approximately 175 basis points of favorable foreign exchange impact. On a constant currency basis, our growth rate is expected to be in a range of negative 1.8% to positive 0.2%, inclusive of a 20 basis point contribution from selling day impact compared to the prior year period. Therefore, our billing day adjusted constant currency growth rate is now expected to be in the range of negative 2.0% to 0%. ", "For the full year 2017 our estimated revenue growth is now expected to be in a range of 1% to 1.5% over the prior year. Foreign exchange is now expected to increase revenues by 0.1%. Taken together, constant currency revenue growth over 2016 is expected to be in the range of 0.9% to 1.4%, inclusive of 120 basis points of acquired revenue from the LDR acquisition. ", "In dollar terms, our full year 2017 revenues are expected to be in a range of $7.760 billion to $7.800 billion. Our expected dollar range is down from our previous guidance range of $7.800 billion to $7.870 billion, with favorable foreign exchange partially offsetting the reduction in our constant currency growth rate.", "Turning to EPS, the earnings flow-through from our lower sales expectation will again have a disproportionately negative impact on our fourth quarter profitability due to the regional and product sales mix, which is only partially offset by favorable currency adjustments versus our previous outlook. Additionally, we continue to invest in critical areas such as specialized sales forces, sales incentive programs, core R&D initiatives, including the knee and robot projects previously mentioned and sales support cost to maximize customer engagement.", "We will also continue to incur incremental manufacturing and distribution costs, primarily in the Warsaw North Campus facility. These increased manufacturing costs are expected to continue to have a negative impact on gross margin throughout 2018, until we implement our dual sourcing strategy and more efficient and automated manufacturing and quality control processes.", "Our fourth quarter projected EPS is in the range of $0.94 to $1.08. After the elimination of amortization, inventory step up in special items, our adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.08 to $2.14. This guidance assumes the fourth quarter effective tax rate of approximately 23.5%. As a result, full year earnings are now estimated to be within a range of $3.80 to $3.93. ", "Special items for 2017 are estimated at approximately $1.260 billion. This is an increase of $25 million from our previous guidance, which is driven by the previously mentioned goodwill write-off, partially offset by lower integration costs. We expect investments in our quality remediation program for 2017 to be consistent with previously stated amounts. We expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 22% as we continue to execute important initiatives that will benefit our future effective tax rate.", "Excluding the impact of amortization, inventory step up and special items, we are reducing our full year 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $8.01 to $8.07. This EPS range represents approximately 0.5% to 1.5% growth over the prior year or 4% to 5% growth when excluding the impact of foreign exchange. ", "We expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1.125 billion and $1.225 billion. We expect to continue prioritizing our free cash flow in the fourth quarter towards debt repayment, continuing our path towards reduced leverage. Finally, please note our guidance does not include any impact from other potential business development transactions or unforeseen events.", "Before we move on to our Q&A, I want to provide an update on our board search to select our next CEO. The process is ongoing and our board continues to make good progress, as it is committed to a thorough and timely search process.", "In closing I\u2019d like to reiterate that we are not satisfied with our current results. Looking forward, we are focused on addressing our production challenges, to allow for greater sales recapture and to enable our sales teams to go back on offence. We will also continue to leverage Zimmer Biomet\u2019s diversified portfolio and a strong pipeline. The new products scheduled for release over the coming 18 months provides further optimism for getting our performance back on track and improving our growth profile.", "With that, I\u2019ll open it up to questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.", "Bob Hopkins", "Thanks and good morning. So it seems to me looking at this release these are our two big changes. One is the remediation supply issues taking longer and the second one is just that the U.S. market is weaker. Before I get to those two, which will be my two questions, I just wanted to clarify, in the third quarter what was your organic growth, organic revenue growth adjusting for selling days, LDR and weather. I just want to make sure I have that number, because it\u2019s not 100% clear from the release.", "Dan Florin", "Sure Bob. So on a constant currency day adjusted basis backing out the LDR contribution its negative 0.2% and we described in the release or in my prepared remarks rather, that the impact of the India knee price cut and the hurricane impact is about, call it 50 basis points. So adjusting for that, call it a 0.3% Q3 performance.", "Bob Hopkins", "Okay, great, thank you. I\u2019m sorry if I missed that in the slide or something. So the two things I really wanted to focus on was one, on the remediation supply side, your pushing back your guidance for when you think it will be completely behind you. What is the one main reason why you are doing that? One main reason for the adjustment and can you quantify what you think the supplier issue, how much its impacting growth right now? ", "Dan Florin", "You know Bob as I said in my prepared remarks, the production output in the third quarter fell below our expectations, which means we did not make progress on reducing the backorder that we expected to, and really as I said, the drivers being a level of process inconsistency in certain core manufacturing or complex manufacturing processes, as well as the increased attrition in the temporary workforce. So a combination of those two factors led to the shortfall in [Audio Gap] production output. ", "So I described what we\u2019re doing about that and in terms of the impact of that on the Q4, you know the point I would make is that our prior Q4 guide assumed we\u2019d be entering the quarter in a healthier supply situation and we had order of magnitude 200 to 250 bps of comp adjusted acceleration in the fourth quarter, really predicated on the assumption of having the supply to go on offense. So that\u2019s the biggest driver of the takedown in Q4.", "Bob Hopkins", "Okay, I\u2019m sure someone will follow-up on the attrition question, but I wanted to get your views on the U.S. hip and knee market. Most of the folks that have reported so far has seen a little bit of weakness, but your calling out a couple of specific things and reasons why you think the market is slower and I was wondering if you could just develop that a little bit more, because some of the growth rates we\u2019re seeing are you know growth rates that are, the week as its seen in sometime. So could you just kind of go in a little more detail on what you think is going on with the U.S. hip and knee market. Thank you.", "Dan Florin", "Sure. So based on what\u2019s been reported we estimate the Q3 U.S. knee and hip market was somewhere between flat to 1% on a day adjusted basis in Q3, which was below our expectations. Our expectations had been more in the 2% to 3% range.", "Q3 is always the slowest from a seasonality perspective and has been the least predictable over the past several years. So we view this as more of a quarter-to-quarter demand dynamic as opposed to any systemic change in the outlook for hip and knee performance and market growth in the U.S. So we continue to believe that 2% to 3% global knee and hip market growth rate is sustainable and you know based upon underlying demographics. So we\u2019re not concerned about the ebb and flow quarter-to-quarter. We still believe in the long term tail of demographics and 2% to 3% global U.S., global hip and knee market growth rate.", "Bob Hopkins", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.", "Mike Weinstein", "Thank you, and maybe I\u2019ll just pick up of where Bob left off there. So the comment in the prepared remarks about U.S. insurance dynamics impacting the end market growth, what are you referencing there?", "Dan Florin", "Well, I think it\u2019s just what we\u2019ve seen Mike is a lot of volatility quarter-to-quarter and I am referring to you know the higher prevalence of high deductable plans, which tends to cause people to have elective procedures on later in the year. It\u2019s just more difficult to predict. I don\u2019t think we have enough data points.", "Mike Weinstein", "This is nothing, but [Cross Talk] impacting the third quarter.", "Dan Florin", "That\u2019s correct.", "Mike Weinstein", "Okay. And then could you spend Dan just a couple of minutes on the dual sourcing strategy and what you\u2019re doing there?", "Dan Florin", "Sure. So I\u2019m referring to a number of more complex manufacturing processes that are in the North Campus, where despite a lot of excellent work by the engineers and that work continues, it\u2019s obvious that we need more capacity on these particular production lines. For obvious reasons I don\u2019t want to get into the weeds on what exactly those processes are, but in fact what we are doing in addition to optimizing inside the four walls of the North Campus, which we\u2019ll continue to do, we\u2019re also looking on the outside, a combination in our current network or with vendors, they add capacity for those particular production activities. So that\u2019s what we mean by dual sourcing. ", "So we\u2019re accelerating that timeline to look for additional capacity that we need and that increased capacity should also as we continue to make improvements on the processes lead to more process and output consistency.", "Mike Weinstein", "Okay, and then last item on your comment on the CEO search, I recognize there is a limitation just to what you can say. You wanted to add anything relative to your thoughts on timing?", "Dan Florin", "No Mike, I would just say that you know as you can appreciate, I am not going to provide specific detail on the board\u2019s process, just that the process is ongoing and our board continues to make good progress and as we\u2019ve always said, we\u2019re committed to a thorough and timely search process. ", "Mike Weinstein", "Understood, thank you.", "Dan Florin", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.", "David Lewis", "Good morning. Dan you just \u2013 a few quick ones here. Just starting this kind of fourth quarter guidance and getting a sense of how conservative you think that number is, it still implies by our math some acceleration in the momentum in the business into the fourth quarter and that has not happened in several quarters. So can you just give us a sense of what drives that underlying momentum acceleration into the fourth quarter and I have a couple of quick follow-ups.", "Dan Florin", "Well as I said before David, the prior guidance assumed much more significant acceleration predicated on full supply. What our Q4 guidance is not assuming is any of the Q3 market softness spilling into the Q4. In other words, our Q4 guidance is assuming a U.S. hip and knee market based upon historical seasonality Q3 to Q4, so we\u2019ve not layered that expectation on top. ", "So I think the underlying guide in Q4 is assuming similar production levels to Q3, a market that\u2019s tied to historical seasonality and the type of progress on these non-affected brands that I described in my prepared remarks. In other words we are making progress on certain products coming out of the North Campus, which helps \u2013 put that in the hands of the sales force to drive some growth and then the last part would be, you know we\u2019re very excited about the Persona Partial Knee and that will continue to have impact in the ensuing quarters.", "David Lewis", "Okay, but if the market does not get better in the fourth quarter, this guidance theoretically could be at risk, said another way.", "Dan Florin", "Well, our assumption about the U.S. hip and knee market for Q4 is a 2% to 3% type year-on-year market growth.", "David Lewis", "Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then Dan, just two questions around earnings. The first question is cost dynamics in the quarter. If I take your revenue reduction for the fourth and I assume a pretty good drop through, you know you get kind of \u2013 you know $0.20 is the reduction for the fourth quarter roughly. I get kind of half that from a high margin product sales drop through. Is the other half coming from the cost of higher employee wages to keep them in their seats and the dual sourcing? Is that a decent way of thinking about it. It\u2019s sort of half increased cost and half about the top line drop through.", "Dan Florin", "You know the drop through on the sales is more than what your modeling, you know because the take down from the prior guidance is focused on the U.S. market, so that EBIT drop through on the mix of sales is more significant than the half that your describing. You know I\u2019d probably put of the takedown between the organic sales and the FX change. You know inclusive of the mix I just described that\u2019s about in the neighborhood of $0.12 of the take down and the balance being tied to incremental cost of goods, the combination of higher production costs and inventory charges tied to the North Campus performance. ", "Matt Abernethy", "Let me clarify the organic component of the take down David is around $65 million, but the offset of the FX benefit around $20 million.", "David Lewis", "Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then Dan I know its early, but if we think about it, there\u2019s a lot of consternation about what the 2018 could be last quarter and is it a decent way of thinking about next year? Do you still believe this business; you know A can grow modestly in 2018. Can you leverage the business growths 1% next year? Is that a decent way to think about core earnings growth? One way I am thinking about it is if the core business grows 1%, you lever earnings 1% and you get currency, you kind of come out at $8.20, $8.30 for next year. I just wondered if you just think about how this business can grow over the next 12 months. Thanks so much.", "Dan Florin", "You know David, I\u2019d say that we are going to provide 2018 guidance in early 2018. We have to see how the year closes and then go through our normal process, taking into account production, sales trends, gross margin etcetera and the investment needs and form thoughts more fully on 2018. ", "I think it\u2019s important to point out that gross margins will continue to be pressured until we increase our U.S. sales growth and optimize the production of the products that are currently produced in the North Campus. So we have planned to do both of those things, but in terms of the gross margin profile, you know if you look at the gross margin profile in the back half of this year as revised, I think that\u2019s the right way to think about gross margin rate for next year. We\u2019ll continue to drive value creation programs across the enterprise. First and foremost top line growth is at the top of the list.", "David Lewis", "Okay, thank you very much Dan.", "Dan Florin", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go to Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim.", "Chris Pasquale", "Thanks, good morning. Alright Dan, you never mentioned the close of the deals during the quarter but the legacies in your portfolio continues to struggle a bit there. How close do you think we are seeing that segment turnaround? Is it just a matter of lapping the impact of some rep turnover or do you need something else like new product flow to get it going in?", "Dan Florin", "Sure Chris. You know first we\u2019re very excited and continue to be very excited about the Mobi-C product line. In addition we expect the recent enhancements to our vitality system and the future robotic spine application to be key enablers to future spine momentum.", "Certainly the recent results have been impacted by the market on the one hand, but probably more so the sales disruption and the channel integration. So you know at this point in time we continue to evaluate and I would say fine tune our sales structure to make sure that we\u2019re positioned for long term spine success. I think we have the portfolio that we need. We have a lot of talent in the sales channel and we\u2019re going to continue to look to fine tune that and make sure that we\u2019re getting that type of performance that equals the potential that we have.", "Chris Pasquale", "Okay. S.E.T. was such a bright spot last year and has taken a couple of steps back. I know that the Warsaw North issues are a big piece of that. But can you talk about the outlook for the business heading into next year and maybe in particular focus on that stem of shoulder launch. How that compares to the competitive product that\u2019s on the market today and how you think about that market opportunity?", "Dan Florin", "Sure. So year-over-year growth slowdown was attributable to more difficult comps, but also really for the first time seeing the cumulative impact on momentum due to supply constrains. So we\u2019ve been describing that from the North Campus. There is certain Biomet Sports Medicine, upper extremities and trauma products that come out of the facility. ", "Importantly Chris S.E.T. remains a strategic growth driver for the company. It\u2019s a very important exciting market for us. We\u2019re clearly focused on improving supply first and foremost in shoulders, sports med and trauma. We\u2019re continuing to invest in specialized sales forces in the S.E.T. category. I think the results of surgical are an excellent proof point of what that can do from a performance perspective and then you\u2019re right, the launch of the new products in 2018, that includes the Stemless Shoulder, as well as the Comprehensive Augmented Baseplates. ", "So you know we\u2019re the market leader in shoulders and getting the Comprehensive Augmented Baseplates out into the markets, an important addition, and we\u2019re very excited about the Stemless Shoulder. We think that\u2019s going to compete very nicely with the other stemless products that are out in the market.", "Next question.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.", "Kristen Stewart", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just going back to the gross margin question and gone looking ahead to 2018, how long do we think that or how long do you think that the gross margins will continue to be pressured by some other costs?", "Dan Florin", "Kristen, sure, sure. The gross margin pressure, the two contributors here in 2017 relative to prior guidance are the sales mix that I was describing earlier, less U.S. sales than expected and then secondly the production costs and related inventory costs out of the North Campus. ", "So the sales mix will improve as we accelerate U.S. growth. The cost of goods from the North Campus as I described is going to persist through 2018 and frankly until we\u2019re, as I described, until we\u2019re into a more automated environment with validated processes and more process consistency in combination with the added capacity. Those are the elements that are needed really to drive improved costs and more consistent output.", "Matt Abernethy", "And to add on that, you know our expectations on what we have communicated previously, that program and the positive benefit on gross margin would start translating into benefit in 2019 and 2020.", "Kristen Stewart", "Okay, and I appreciate you don\u2019t want to give any sort of color on 2018 in terms of the specific guidance, but are there any other puts and takes that you can give us just to help frame 2018 at this standpoint?", "Dan Florin", "Kristen as I said, I really want to see how we close Q4, see what kind of momentum we have exiting the year and then monitor the progress that we\u2019re making on our dual sourcing strategy and the engineering improvements inside the North Campus. That will inform our view on production output, which is so critical to getting full supply into the hands of our great sales force to drive growth. So I\u2019d rather wait until our guidance early next year.", "Kristen Stewart", "Okay, that\u2019s fair. Thank you.", "Dan Florin", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Litman with Oppenheim.", "Steven Litman", "Thanks. Hi guys. First of all, I was wondering if you could just frame for us about what percent of the recon business falls into the more complex products that are still supply constrained versus those that you feel that you are in a better position from a supply perspective?", "Dan Florin", "Steve I \u2013 you know without getting into the exact quantification of that, I would tell you that a lot of the brands that come out of the North Campus, which of course is you know a Biomet facility, a lot of those brands were in fact faster growing product lines and it stands knees, hips, sports extremities and trauma. ", "So it\u2019s a significant facility for Zimmer Biomet. The complex processes without getting into the weeds on what those exactly are do impact a significant number of those brands and I think that the quantification of that is apparent in the impact it\u2019s having on our performance and our revised guidance.", "Steven Litman", "Okay, got it. And then Dan just a couple of products for next year. Can you talk to how much you think not having cementless has also impacted knee growth and how that may be important for the back half of next year? And then I know on Rose, obviously a lot of talk about getting into knees, but you\u2019re not really fully rolled out in spine yet. Is that also targeted for mid to back half of next year?", "Dan Florin", "Sure. We\u2019re very excited about the pipeline for 2018 and we\u2019re excited about what percent of partial knee will do for us in 2018, we\u2019re excited about getting the cementless Persona out and we\u2019ve had a competitor talk about cementless being as much as 20% of their knee mix that comes at a nice price point, so we\u2019re very excited about getting that out into the market middle of next year and we think that product will perform very well and then we\u2019ve also talked about getting the Persona revision system out into the market. So a lot of really important Persona product launches next year.", "On the ROSA side we\u2019re on the knee application. Continue to make progress in accordance with the timeline that we\u2019ve described before and then keep in mind that the Medtech where the platform is currently approved for brain and you know we\u2019re very excited about that opportunity. So our craniomaxillofacial business, which is one of our best performing divisions in the company continues to drive good growth. It\u2019s under very capable leadership and that same leadership is overseeing the brain and spine ROSA development program. ", "So on the ROSA Spine, the expectation is middle of next year to be out in the market. We think that product and application will compete very favorably with the other spine robotic systems that are currently in the market. ", "Steven Litman", "Okay, thanks Dan. ", "Dan Florin", "You\u2019re welcome. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with Barclays. ", "Matt Taylor", "Hey, good morning, thanks for taking the question. I guess the first thing I wanted to circle back on was when you are talking about normalized 2% to 3% market growth here in Q4, can you comment on whether you are seeing that through the first month of the quarter or are you seeing any continued insurance dynamics or other soft spots that would cause the Q4 market growth to be lower? ", "Dan Florin", "Matt, our 2% to 3% U.S. market assumption is based upon historical norms. So what I was describing before is that we stuck with that assumption about the market and did not add on top of that the softness in Q3. So I\u2019m not going to comment on inter-quarter months, but I\u2019d say at this point the 2% to 3% U.S. knee and hip growth is the right way to think about it based on historical norms. ", "Matt Abernethy", "And just to add to that Matt is usually the big bowl of some procedures pushes into November and December, so near term read is obviously difficult, but there is no indication that we are aware of that, that\u2019s pointing to something other than what we communicated. ", "Matt Taylor", "Okay and then when we think about the improvements that you can make going forward to your ability to produce some of these key brands, you talked about 2Q \u201918 as being really the turning point when you\u2019d be able to have full supply. So can you just clarify it, does that mean that if you are going to really take until the third quarter for you to go back fully on offence or can we see that kind of early in the second quarter? I just wanted to get little bit more specific on the timing. ", "Dan Florin", "Yeah Matt, from a timing and recovery perspective, it\u2019s a rolling recovery okay. So during Q4 here we\u2019ll be making continued progress on certain brands; Q1, Q2 we\u2019ll continue to make progress and that incremental progress is critical and meaningful, because what means is that our sales force can then gradually move away from being the case logistics people that they have been to more higher trust that the products will be there and then going on offence and not only servicing existing accounts, but going after new business that we know is out there for us. ", "So it\u2019s a rolling improvement. Some brands will continue to get healthy through Q1. My comment about Q2 was in the vein of having full supply ready to go on offence across all brands with our engineering improvements and duel sourcing strategy contributing to that pace of recovery. So you know, that\u2019s the comment relative to Q2 and that sets us up well for thereafter. ", "Matt Taylor", "Okay, thanks very much guys. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kaila Krum with William Blair. ", "Kaila Krum", "Hey guys, thanks for taking our questions. First, I got this to start off; what percentage of your surgeon customers today would you say are waiting on the sidelines sort of prior to a complete supply recover here? Is it 20%, is it a third, is it as much as half; just any sense for that would be helpful. ", "Matt Abernethy", "Sure. You know I spent a fair bit of time in the field over the past quarter and continue to be impressed by the talent of our sales force, the belief of our sales force and our surgeons with respect to Zimmer Biomet. That\u2019s critical and gives me confidence that over time as supply recovers, that we are going to get the accelerated growth that we know is out there and I\u2019m confident that we are going to deliver on that. ", "It is the case that surgeons are frustrated. They believe in Zimmer Biomet, they believe in their sales rep and you do have instances where we are able to fully supply surgeons and it is the case that you have other surgeons that are sitting on the sidelines waiting for the full range of SKUs available across our product family before they entrust their business act to us. So that\u2019s where our focus is. ", "I\u2019d also add that the lack of full supply tampers our ability to bring on new surgeons at the top of the funnel so to speak. So we know the ticket is full supply, that\u2019s why we are focused on it and as that supply picture improves I have no doubt that our sales team will run with that and make good progress. ", "Kaila Krum", "Okay, thanks, that\u2019s helpful. And I guess just, you said we are going to reach supply stability by the end this year with a portion of the products and the rest by the second quarter of \u201918. I guess what sort of visibility do we have into that recovery at this time, and what gives you confidence in that statement made? ", "Dan Florin", "Well, with the guidance takedown that\u2019s embedded in our Q4, it tells you that production is the biggest barrier. So our assumption about production output for Q4 is that production is similar to Q3 levels and what gives us confidence on the recapture, which again is more of a exiting this year and gradually through next year, is tied to what I was describing before in terms of the interactions with surgeons and our sales force and their beliefs in the portfolio.", "So we know what we need to do. Its tied to production of the North Campus, but it\u2019s also you know our team is executing very well with Persona and I mentioned good growth in the quarter on Persona; I mentioned the educational event that we did on Person where we had hundreds of surgeons attending that, demonstrating the versatility of both the implants and the instrumentation of Persona. So I know that our sales team is going to make a lot of progress with the Persona platform. ", "And then on the production side of the house, the key is really as I described process consistency. So reducing the variability in those processes, getting redundant capacity out to either vendors of elsewhere in our network as duel source capacity; that\u2019s a combination of those two areas. ", "Kaila Krum", "Thanks guys. ", "Dan Florin", "You\u2019re welcome. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. ", "Matthew O'Brien ", "Thanks for taking the question and good morning. Just for starters on the guide down for Q4 by my math, you know net of currency its about $40 million guide down. I\u2019m assuming a majority of that is related to these complex products that you can\u2019t manufacture. So first of all, is that math about right and then secondly, is that roughly what we should expect in Q1 as far as the headwind that would will face in that business, maybe tapering down a little bit and then tapering down even more into Q2 next year. ", "Dan Florin", "So Matt, the Q4 takedown, you have the right net number. I think organically the number is north of that. The organic takedown as Matt mentioned before is more like $65 million with some favorable currency in the range of $20 million. So it\u2019s the organic takedown is north of the 200 basis points. ", "And you know I\u2019d say the organic take down of 300, call it, call half of that being tied to supply and lack of offence. We also had dialed in Q4 guidance, prior guidance and acceleration in spine and as I mentioned before, we\u2019ve removed that from the guidance based on current performance as we need to drive improved performance in the sales channel and then to a lesser extent the impact being the India knee price, which we expect that to be a drag on Q3 as well. ", "Matthew O'Brien ", "And as the manufacturing push out goes, Dan how comfortable are you with you know the timeline that you\u2019ve laid out now of Q2 next year being you know completely finished with this issue and how, you know all inclusive or how broad is the plan that you put in place to ensure that that will be the definitive moment where all this issue is behind you from a production perspective, be it the duel sourcing etc. and then how does FDA fit within that timing? ", "Dan Florin", "Well Matt, we as I said in my prepared remarks, we continue to make good progress on the quality remediation in the North Campus. So we are very much on track with the remediation plan that we laid out for the FDA at the end of last year. So we feel really good about our progress there. You know it\u2019s been roughly a year since the FDA inspected the facility. We don\u2019t know exactly when FDA will come back in, but we will be prepared for them when they do. ", "With respect to the production recovery and the timeline, you know operating this plant under the manual interim process control environment leads to greater variability and inherent risk that\u2019s associated with the output and it is what it is. What I am confident about is that the engineers are focused on the right areas for improvement. We brought in technical experts from the outside to help in that regard and we are also working closely with outside vendors who have certain capabilities, speculative confidence that they are going to be able to help drive that added capacity. So that\u2019s what gives us the confident to lay out the timeline that I just laid out Matt. ", "Matthew O'Brien ", "All right, thank you. ", "Dan Florin", "You\u2019re welcome. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bruce Nudell with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Bruce, we are unable to hear you. Please check your mute function. ", "Bruce Nudell", "Hi Dan, could you hear me know? ", "Dan Florin", "Yes Bruce, good morning. ", "Bruce Nudell", "Yeah, good morning. You know post the Zuk divestiture, you had about 39% just in share. It looks to be about 36% now. Just given any lingering issues with supply that caused permanent customer defections, and perhaps sales force defections as well as a lack of a robot, where do you think you guys will add some tone, and you know how much of that is due to the lack of a robotic solution? ", "Dan Florin", "You know Bruce I would say that based on the early, well both the limited release and now the full release of the Persona Partial Knee systems, we are extremely confident in that platform and I personally talked to surgeons who have used the makeover for Uni Knees and are excited to use the Personal Partial Knee system. Those are surgeons that have had excellent success with the Personal Primary System and our excited about using the Personal Partial Knee. So we believe that we will win back market share that we lost as a result of this divestiture. ", "Bruce Nudell", "And you know but just more broadly, where do you think you know knee share will stabilize and where will you kind of \u2013 how much of that 39% did you get back. ", "Dan Florin", "Well our efforts, you know we have internal goals to recover all of the loss business of Zuk. We have again \u2013 the feedback is very positive on the Persona Partial Knee. So as we have full supply across all of our knee systems, we are in a good spot with Personal Primary, but as we get healthier on Vanguard and as we launch the cementless Persona and the Revision knee, our goal is to first and foremost get back to market growth. ", "You know we\u2019ve been seeding share; that needs to stop. Supply in the pipeline into the hands of the sales force will enable that and first and foremost we are focused on closing the gap to market, then putting up a string of quarters at market growth and then above market growth thereafter. So it\u2019s a whole string of things that we know we need to execute on better and that will lead to market share gains. ", "Bruce Nudell", "And I guess my follow-up is, you know this is the first time I\u2019ve heard the company talk about expectations for the worldwide major joint market at 2% to 3%; it was always closer to 3%. I\u2019m sure that wasn\u2019t taken lightly, and how does the impact the boards perceptions, the necessity to move away from hips and knees?", "Dan Florin", "Well, to win Bruce for Zimmer Biomet we need to perfume in hips and knees and that, you know our performance in hips and knees in the Asia Pacific region has been excellent and that performance in Asia Pacific is really driven by the team and they\u2019ve not been as dependent on the North Campus products as much as the U.S. markets. But the team has done extraordinarily well and we expect them to continue to do so. The EMEA growth in the quarter for knees was quite good. ", "So the 2% to 3% I would just tell you that we are still of the belief this is an attractive market. The demographic tailwinds are real, so we are committed to growing hips and knees. For us to win, we need to perform really well there. At the same time, we\u2019ve talked a lot about the S.E.T category; you know 21% of our sales mix today, why we are very excited to continue to perform there. ", "It was hampered by supply this quarter, that will improve over time and we\u2019ll look to continue both organically and inorganically to add to the S.E.T bag. It\u2019s a critical driver for us and last piece being spine, so my comments about spine and our potential to drive accelerated performance there. So it\u2019s really across the portfolio where we need to perform. ", "Bruce Nudell", "Thanks so much. Bye.", "Dan Florin", "All right Lauran, we have time for one last question. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go to Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. ", "Joanne Wuensch", "Thank you very much for talking the question. Could you qualitatively discuss what\u2019s going on with the sales force? How you are thinking about keeping them in place motivated and making sure that they see there is a turning point in this process?", "Dan Florin", "Absolutely Joanne. I mentioned the amount of the time that I\u2019ve personally been spending in the field and that includes direct time with our sales leadership for the orthopedics business and as well as a good piece of our spine sales force. ", "So in a nutshell, we continue to post them regularly on the updates with respect to supply. On top of that, we are placing a tremendous focus on all of our team members on supporting our sales channels globally. I think importantly we\u2019ve seen relatively stable levels of attrition; so a net neutral performance from a headcount standpoint of the channel in the United States here in Q3. ", "So I think that is indicative of a sales force that continues to believe in Zimmer Biomet, continues to believe in our products and our pipeline and a lot of high touch with them and communication will be necessary as we continue to move forward. So I believe we got the best sales force in the industry. We need to fully equip them with all the tools they need to win, that\u2019s where our focus is. ", "Joanne Wuensch", "Thank you and as for my second question, it\u2019s going to sound so mundane given everything going on. SG&A was nicely down as percentage of revenue year-over-year. Are there still expense synergies to be had by the combination of these two companies?", "Dan Florin", "Joanne, we\u2019ve described here in 2017 synergies in the neighborhood of $225 million, and leading to $310 million cumulative, okay. So you know that, the integration synergies are on track through 2017. So as I described we\u2019ll continue to look at other value creation opportunities across the enterprise. We know that first and foremost it starts with top-line performance and acceleration. And then last bit on SG&A, you know our SG&A percentage includes the depreciation of our instrument placements, which is part of obviously a growth investment for us, so we continue to invest in the working capital and instrumentation necessary to drive growth. ", "Joanne Wuensch", "Okay, thank you very much. ", "Dan Florin", "So, thank you everyone for your attendance today and we look forward to speaking with you on the fourth quarter call. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you again for participating in today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect. ", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

I would like to turn the call over to Derek Davis, Interim Vice President, Investor Relations. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.", "Mr. Davis, you may begin your call.", "Derek Davis", "Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today is our President and CEO, Bryan Hanson as well as our CFO, Dan Florin.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.", "Also, the discussions during this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, are included within the earnings release found on our website.", "In addition to the earnings release issued this morning, we have posted a quarterly presentation on our website at investor.zimmerbiomet.com, to supplement the content we will be covering this morning.", "With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over Bryan.", "Bryan Hanson", "Thanks, Derek. Good morning and thank you for joining us today on my first earnings call as President and CEO of Zimmer Biomet. Since joining the company six weeks ago, I\u2019ve had the pleasure of beginning a dialog with our key stakeholders, including many of our customers and distributors, senior Zimmer Biomet leadership and team members from around the globe. I\u2019ve also connected with a number of our investors in addition to analysts who follow our stock. Candor and transparency have been important parts of this process and having an active and continuous dialog allows me to integrate a broad range of perspectives in developing our plans to lead Zimmer Biomet to higher levels of innovation, commercial success and profitability.", "Through these meetings, I\u2019ve been gaining deeper insight into Zimmer Biomet\u2019s operations and opportunities, both what we\u2019re doing well today and importantly where we need improvement. Overall, my initial impressions have reaffirmed our rationale for taking the job as well as my confidence that my background aligns well with the work that the Zimmer Biomet team does and what needs to be done to position the company for improved performance.", "In speaking with our stakeholders, it\u2019s clear that Zimmer Biomet is working from a strong foundation that includes the industry's broadest portfolio, a robust commercial pipeline, meaningful market share in key end markets and world class sales teams. By virtue of those strengths, we also have the potential to go beyond our share of leadership and large joints to drive diversified growth in a number of attractive markets, such as sports medicine, extremities and trauma. Our global scale and depth of portfolio also position us to continue expanding access to our solutions in under penetrated patient subset in global markets.", "In terms of our innovation capabilities, Zimmer Biomet is uniquely positioned to leverage platform technologies across our entire portfolio, including advanced proprietary materials and surgical robotics applications. As a company, we plan to build on this foundation. We will have an unwavering emphasis on patient safety and quality excellence, creating an engaged and innovative workplace and working to position the company to deliver top quartile total shareholder returns.", "And on a personal level, I've been inspired by the way surgeons have expressed their confidence in our portfolio and in our people. Zimmer Biomet\u2019s 90-year reputation has been built on serving the needs of patients and surgeons and that resonates with my own values. All of that said, I'm not naive about the company's current challenges. I'm committed to turning Zimmer Biomet\u2019s performance around with a deliberate emphasis on rebuilding revenue momentum in the near term as well as execution that leads to value creation.", "To get us there, I plan to draw on what I've learned from leading and building large global medical technology businesses. Working closely with the management team at Zimmer Biomet, we have been reviewing the 2018 operating plan to clearly define our go-forward strategies in a number of key areas. Although our review of the operating plan is ongoing, we have identified several immediate opportunities to improve Zimmer Biomet\u2019s operational execution and address certain near term challenges.", "First, we will continue completing our quality remediation efforts at the Warsaw North Campus. Our teams have been undertaking this focused work over the past 13 months for the benefit of input from expert consultants. To support the success and quality compliance of our manufacturing network, we will also continue investing in the development of a best-in-class quality management system. ", "Second, in order to return to offense and accelerate sales recapture, we will remain focused on fully restoring the supply of certain key brands within our knee, hip and SET categories. To that end, our teams continue to make progress on increasing the production levels of these products, which have been supply constraint due to quality remediation requirements and the non-automation of the North Campus. I reviewed the team's detailed plans for revenue acceleration through supply recovery and I'm confident as I said before that we have the right overall strategy in place.", "As I've dug into the details with the team, I see both opportunities and risks associated with the milestones within our schedule. My sense at this time is that these milestones represent more risk than opportunity. We will provide more details on our progress in this area when we provide full year guidance on our Q1 earnings call.", "Turning to our commercial strategy, our immediate priorities are to restore supply, engage with the sales channel and return to offense. I carried a sales bag when I started my career, which means I absolutely understand the vital role of the commercial team. Zimmer Biomet\u2019s leadership is fully committed to reconnecting and rebuilding trust with our sales forces as they engage with our customers. In addition to sales recapture, we will also be focused on the significant number of commercial releases we have scheduled in 2018, including the critical additions of cementless and revision systems for our Persona knee family as well as the limited launch of the robotic application for knees.", "We have stressed to our commercial leaders that these new product introductions must be launched with excellence to ensure that they are catalysts for growth and share recapture. Last but not least, we are currently focused on gaining a deeper understanding of Zimmer Biomet\u2019s culture. Together, we will build a cohesive company where our team members are engaged and valued, feel accountable for delivering on our commitments and act with a sense of urgency.", "Looking to 2018 and beyond, we will be focused on improving the predictability and consistency of our top line growth, which is a commitment to shareholders that I take very seriously. While I recognize that there is a lot of hard work in front of us, I\u2019m confident that with the focused execution of our immediate goals, target investments in this business and a strong culture, we will raise our performance to a higher level and drive sustained shareholder value.", "With that, I want to turn now to the fourth quarter results. On a consolidated basis, we delivered improved top line growth in the fourth quarter. Our results benefited from several tailwind events in the quarter, including stronger than expected underlying US market growth, which likely reflected a step up in procedures due to insurance dynamics and a recovery from the Q3 hurricane impact. In addition, we experienced an acceleration in growth of our already solid performing Asia Pacific business, which benefited in the quarter from strong distributor orders.", "Consolidated fourth quarter net sales were $2.074 billion, an increase of 3% over the prior year period and 1.5% on a constant currency basis. Billing day differences provided a slight tailwind to the year-over-year growth. In the Asia Pacific region, we delivered a strong 7.2% quarterly sales growth and our Americas region grew 0.8% in the quarter. In Europe, Middle East and Africa, our revenues were relatively flat at a minus 0.3%.", "Full year net sales for 2017 were 7.824 billion, an increase of 1.8% over 2016 results on a constant currency basis, which included approximately 130 basis points of contribution from the LDR acquisition. From a market perspective, fourth quarter US knee and hip procedural volumes were quite strong. We estimate that US knee and hip increased around 2.5% during Q4 compared to flattish in Q3. With regard to pricing, we experienced negative pressure of 2.9% during the fourth quarter and negative 2.5% for the full year.", "Knee sales were flat compared to the prior year and were slightly better than our Q3 growth rate, due primarily to the stronger US market and increased demand for our Persona Partial knee system, which has continued to garner positive feedback. Despite the improved growth rate in Q4, we believe that the gap between our Americas knee growth and the overall market continued to widen in the fourth quarter. Looking forward, we will remain focused on restoring full supply of our knee product line as well as launching a number of important new products to drive future growth and narrowing our gap to market.", "Hip sales increased 1.6% during the fourth quarter and were driven by our strong performance in the Asia Pacific region where we had double digit sales growth. Although we improved quarterly sales of our Taperloc G7 and Arcos systems, supply constraints continued to limit our ability to meet the demand of these high growth brands. ", "SET sales grew 4.6% over the fourth quarter of last year with numerous products across this category contributing to growth. We drove solid quarterly sales of our surgical portfolio and within upper extremities, we saw strong demand for the comprehensive shoulder during the quarter. Since November, we have received several FDA clearances in this subcategory and we are particularly excited about the US clearance of our Sidus shoulder. However, while we are encouraged that demand for these key brands remains high, we must restore supply before we can fully capitalize on these opportunities. As we work to resolving supply constraints that are a headwind on our SET performance, we will continue to invest in the success of these higher growth businesses.", "Turning to our dental business, sales were relatively flat during the fourth quarter. While dental sales in both the Americas and Asia Pacific region grew challenges from the restructuring of our dental sales organization in certain key Western European markets continued to impact our performance. We remain focused on our commercial and product initiatives to position this business for a sustainable growth. During the fourth quarter, sales of our spine, Craniomaxillofacial and thoracic businesses increased by 0.5%. ", "While we benefited from strong demand of our Mobi-C Cervical Disc, our spine business continued to underperform due to revenue dissynergies related to our US spine sales force integration. We continue to work to resolve the impact of these dissynergies, including recent senior leadership changes and we expect to realize the benefit of cross-selling opportunities in the future. Our CMF and thoracic business contributed sales growth during the fourth quarter, with continued strong demand for thoracic products, driven by our SternaLock and RibFix Blu brands.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan who will review our fourth quarter results in greater detail as well as our first quarter 2018 sales and earnings guidance. Dan?", "Dan Florin", "Thank you, Bryan. I'll provide details on our fourth quarter financial performance and then cover sales and earnings guidance for Q1, 2018. As Bryan covered, our net sales in the quarter increased by 3.0% over the prior year period with an increase of 1.5% on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted gross profit margin was 72.7% for the quarter, in line with our expectations. This was 190 basis points lower than the prior year period due to continued incremental manufacturing and inventory costs, primarily at our Warsaw North Campus facility as well as the impact of price declines.", "Our operating expenses were higher than provided in our original Q4 guidance due to incremental spending on critical projects in our R&D portfolio as well as investments in our commercial channel. We also incurred additional expenses related to planning and implementing strategies related to US tax reform legislation.", "Our R&D expense was 4.6% of revenue at $95 million, essentially in line with the prior year. SG&A expenses were $771 million dollars in the fourth quarter or 37.1% of sales, which reflects lower non-sales force incentive based compensation expense compared to the prior year. In the quarter, we recorded pretax charges of $668 million in special items, 150 million of which were cash outflows for quality remediation, business integration and other items, the non-cash charges related to intangible amortization, certain legal matters and the goodwill impairment write off related to our spine business unit. ", "Our diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $6.16, which includes a one-time tax benefit of approximately $6.40, resulting from the recently enacted US tax reform legislation. This adjustment is reflected in the income tax line and has been removed from our adjusted earnings. Adjusted fourth quarter 2017 figures in the earnings release also exclude the impact of the other special items that I mentioned. ", "Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to $644 million or 31% of sales, which was 130 basis points lower when compared to the prior year period, driven by the previously described decline in gross margin. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was in line with our expectations at 23.4%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $2.10, a decrease of 1.9% from the prior year period on 204.1 million weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding. A reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning's press release.", "Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $403 million, inclusive of the $150 million of previously mentioned cash special items and our free cash flow was $275 million. During the fourth quarter, the company repaid $300 million of debt, bringing the total 2017 debt repayment to $1.25 billion. ", "I'd like to now turn to Q1 2018 guidance. For the first quarter, we expect revenues to be in a range of $1.955 billion dollars to $1.995 billion, which includes approximately 300 basis points of favorable foreign exchange impact. On a constant currency basis, our revenue is expected to decline within a range of negative 4% to negative 2%. As a reminder, we have one less billing day in the quarter compared to the prior year quarter, which is negatively impacting these results. This headwind will reverse in quarters two through four, so that for the full year 2018, there is no net billing day impact.", "", "The step down from our Q4 revenue growth rate is due to a number of factors, including the impact of one less billing day, an assumption that the worldwide orthopedics market will soften somewhat from the Q4 growth rate, our expectation of a slower growth rate in our Asia-Pacific region in light of a very strong fourth quarter performance, which benefited from distributor orders as well as a temporary reduction in elective procedures in the UK.", "Regarding North Campus production, we expect our Q1 production output to be at least at the level we achieved in Q4. While we are not providing full year guidance today, I would like to share some details to help your models. We expect improvement from our Q1 sales growth rate as the year progresses, driven by the normalization of billing days, increasing supply levels as we progress through the year, enhanced commercial execution and to a lesser extent, the contribution from new product launches. Importantly, these new product launches should create momentum for our sales teams as we exit 2018 and enter 2019.", "Turning to EPS, for Q1 and the full year, our gross margin rate will be in a range between 72% and 73%, likely towards the lower end of that range in Q1 and improving slightly in subsequent quarters. Our gross margin rate will be a significant headwind for us in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 and then should normalize in the second half of 2018, as we anniversary into the North Campus variances. ", "We will continue to invest in critical areas on the commercial side of the business with a bias towards investments that drive near-term growth as supply recovers as well as core R&D initiatives, including the knee and robot projects previously mentioned. As we continue to assess our 2018 operating plan, there will likely be further changes to our investment profile. As a result, our first quarter projected diluted EPS is in the range of $0.73 to $0.88. After the elimination of amortization, inventory step up and special items, our adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.84 to $1.91. This guidance assumes a first quarter effective tax rate in the range of 19% to 20%.", "In addition to my prior comments on gross margin, to help you with your P&L models, you should expect our full-year adjusted effective tax rate to be in the same range as Q1 between 19% and 20%. To be clear, we plan to reinvest the tax savings into the business to drive top line growth. Further, as we mentioned earlier this month at a conference, we have a year-over-year expense headwind on non-sales force performance based compensation programs. This headwind, which approximates $35 million is a result of not paying out full bonuses in 2017 due to shortfalls in operating performance. The majority of that expense is recorded in SG&A.", "We expect our Q1 2018 free cash flow to be in the range of $250 million to $300 million. As a reminder, our goal is to allocate substantially all of our free cash flow towards debt repayment. Finally, please note our guidance does not include any impact from other potential business development transactions or unforeseen events.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bryan. Bryan?", "Bryan Hanson", "Thanks, Dan. Before we move to Q&A, I just want to take a minute and thank Dan. Over the last six months, he decided to not just have the hat of CFO, but also become CEO of the organization and I can tell you from talking to people, his leadership during that time really made people feel confident about the business. I just want to say thank you for the effort that you put in over the last six months and for the time that we've already spent together and I look forward to working with you.", "With that, I'll turn the call back to the moderator who will begin the Q&A portion of our call.", "Question-And-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan.", "Mike Weinstein", "Bryan, as a starting point before we kind of get into the details of the business and some of the comments, [indiscernible] in the feedback that you've gotten from the commercial teams, from the distributors and reps, as you've had some early meetings with them, I know you've been traveling around a fair amount early on, kind of what you've heard on their view on the business, what the current state morale is and their relative enthusiasm for the changes that have already taken place and what's to come? Thanks.", "Bryan Hanson", "So I've spent as much time as I possibly can with the commercial team so far, had an opportunity to spend a lot of one-on-one time with folks in the field. As I think you know, I've met with you before. And really, it's kind of a hand-in-hand, let's go visit the customer, let\u2019s go to cases and let me live the life that you've got in that day that I\u2019m there. And I got to tell you that, that combined with the recent kickoff meeting that we had for the Americas where there were a couple of thousand sales representatives there, I've had really good exposure early on to the organization.", "The first thing I would say is that we, no doubt in my mind, have the best sales organization in the industry. I feel very confident about that. This is a team that that is engaged with the surgeons, it\u2019s extremely knowledgeable about the space, has energy around, what it is they think we can do. And so, so I'm very confident that we've got the right team. But what I see inside of it though and what I'm hearing from the organization is there has been, what I would define as a, maybe a lack of focus from senior leadership and engagement with the sales organization. ", "They felt a little orphaned if you will and that\u2019s going to change. It's changed already. I feel like just the time that I spent with them has been getting out pretty quickly, it\u2019s spreading almost like a wildfire if you will the news of the time I\u2019ve been in the field and I had an opportunity to spend about an hour, presenting to that broad team at the kickoff meeting and I can tell you that my enthusiasm on the stage was fueled by the enthusiasm that I felt from the audience and what they were hearing. And so I got to tell you that we're early on in this, but I believe we've already made as a senior management team, with the focus we've had with the commercial organization an impact.", "So to sum it up, I think we've got a great team. I think that we've got to work on the morale and the engagement and we've already begun that process, but I feel real confident about the team.", "Dan Florin", "This is Dan. I'll just add to that briefly. Having been to a number of these sales meetings before, I can tell you the energy, enthusiasm and excitement of our sales team is off the charts compared to where it's been and the energy in the room was -- people were just using it with enthusiasm and Bryan did a terrific job and really connected with the sales team.", "Mike Weinstein", "That's good to hear. Let me follow up on the supply side. Bryan, your comments, is that with -- I think you said the milestones represent more risk right now maybe than opportunity, could you just update us on where you are on supply coming out of the North campus and maybe set expectations for the year in terms of the cadence, so when you think you'll see products and when you'll be in a better position to go on the offensive?", "Bryan Hanson", "So I'm going to give you kind of a comprehensive view of this thing because obviously I've been thinking a lot about it. So I apologize for probably a longer winded answer here. But I think, first of all, it's important recognize, I think Dan said it earlier that our performance out of that factory has stayed consistent with our expectations. So right now, we're consistent with what we've been saying. ", "And I want to be real clear, the strategy that I see for the supply and recovery and really the comprehensive project plan that we see around this is sound. I have confidence in it. I do feel that the timeline we've communicated in the past, at the end of Q2, recovery is a possibility. So I just don't want to take that off the table. I do feel that's a possibility. That said, I do think there's more risk probably in a timeline than opportunity. And let me just give you an explanation for this and I kind of bifurcate my thinking on this in two different ways.", "The first piece that I think about is just the raw project plan, the risk of actually achieving a timeline of recovery, so that plan itself. And the second piece is what I define as kind of the delay that I think we're going to see in translating that recovery, that product recovery into accelerated revenue growth. Right? So those are kind of the pieces that I break this up and let me just first hit these, the supply piece.", "Again, I think that there are key milestones that we have in front of us that I think both have risk and opportunity in them, but the complexity of the project just tells me, just given my history with projects like this that most people believe inside of these timelines that things are going to go as planned and I put that in kind of air quotes. What I've learned over the years and I think most people have that run these complex projects is things never go as planned and unplanned events always occur. ", "And as a results of just knowing that and kind of the spicy sense if you will and looking at it, I believe there's more risk than opportunity in the timeline that we see. So it just comes down to the complexity, history with projects like this, you usually see more slippage than you do see people pulling it in. That's the first piece.", "The second piece is really a thing that we probably most care about, which is how do we then take the supply recovery and turn that into or translate that into actual acceleration of revenue growth. And I think it's going to be more delayed than what maybe you're thinking and maybe even what I thought when I came in and a lot of this is as a result of the time I\u2019ve been spending with the sales organization.", "And so here's my sense on this, this is kind of on two fronts. One, there's just a lack of trust right now from the sales organization for corporate. We have given them timelines that we have failed on and they've gone out through the information they have received from us, approach the customer only to have to pull back again. And so that lack of trust is going to create a situation where even when we have supply available, they're going to wait, they're going to wait. They've been defending their surgeons through logistics hoops they've been jumping through. ", "They're going to wait with this new inventory, defend their surgeons without having to jump through those hoops and when they feel really confident that those surgeons are in place and intact, then they're going to go on the offensive. And when you think about this, and I\u2019ve been in sales and I understand the process, it isn't a light switch that occurs. You've got to go out now and build the trust of folks because they haven\u2019t been on the offensive, right, you've got to build the trust of other surgeons, you've got to build your offensive bullpen and then ultimately as a result of that bullpen, you start converting business.", "So there's a delayed impact of supply recovery as a result of that. So I just want to make sure that that's clear in the way that I'm thinking about it now and as I've gotten more educated on the topic and spent time with our reps. Again, I'm not going to give you specifics right now because that's going to come in our first quarter earnings call with guidance, but I will give you just kind of the way I'm thinking about it right now and you should be thinking about it the same way.", "I see this as a gradual revenue recovery into 2019. And if you're thinking about it in that way, I think it's the right way to put a lens on this and as we get smarter on the topic and burn down some of these risks through the milestones, we'll give you more insight, but that's where my thinking is right now.", "Mike Weinstein", "And just before I let others jump in, I assume the FDA has not been in yet for re-inspection.", "Bryan Hanson", "They have not and obviously that's a very material milestone that we're paying attention to.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America.", "Bob Hopkins", "My first question, I just wanted to follow up on some of the things that Mike was talking about as it relates to your comments about risk versus opportunity. And I just want to be very clear on your pipeline and whether or not to comment on risk versus opportunity, what that might imply for some of the things you guys have been talking about for a while now, specifically, could you comment on the timelines for cementless, for Persona revision, for the robotic platform, are those affected by the potential for more risk and opportunity as it relates to the North campus?", "Bryan Hanson", "So I\u2019ll give you just kind of my broad thinking on this, because obviously again this is a vector that I've been spending a lot of time on and I feel really good about the product pipeline that we've gotten. And as I said before, I've been out with stakeholders a lot and you can have the general managers and the marketing folks who rate people and give you a feel for whether or not we've got the right products in the pipeline. ", "But what really sells it for me is when I go talk to surgeons who know about the pipeline and I talk to our sales reps who ultimately have to sell the pipeline and both those stakeholders are selling it, we've got the right pieces inside of the product portfolio and they're excited about getting those in the field as quickly as they can. I feel pretty confident about the timelines that we have. There's always in these things as you get closer to the end launch date, you get some slight slippage, but I don't see anything material there. ", "The key to it though is this, right? When you look at just taking knee as an example, because it\u2019s a big franchise for us, we've got the partial knee out now, using Persona technology which is getting great traction, it's a big first step in the right direction. We\u2019ve got cementless coming up in the timelines we've communicated are ones that we still feel comfortable with. We\u2019ve got revision and then robotics come in as well. ", "That to me is a full portfolio that we need to truly get back on the offensive, all right, truly get back on the offensive. The key thing though is it's not the limited lines. That's where you're doing the learning. Really for me is when we get those out, get through the limited launch, get into full launch, that's when you've got full capacity with the bag and the way you should be thinking about that particularly with revision and robotics is the full launch will come anywhere from four to six months after a limited launch, which put us close to the middle of 2019.", "So if you're thinking about full capability, full bag in that very important segment for us in the knee, that comes around mid-2019. It doesn't mean we won\u2019t get an opportunity to take advantage of the stuff that launches in between that, but the fully loaded for bear, attitude from the sales representatives will come in that mid-2019 timeframe.", "Bob Hopkins", "And then just one other question I wanted to ask is a little bit more on -- centered on the fourth quarter and the comments on the first quarter and the guidance. Could you maybe help us sort of quantify some of the tailwinds that you benefited from in Q4 that you think will fall off in Q1? But I think you mentioned Asia, the hurricane, maybe the market softening a little bit, just I also assume there's probably a little bit of conservatism in those numbers as well. So maybe just talk -- help us quantify some of the things that helped you in Q4 that you don't think will be there in Q1.", "Bryan Hanson", "So I'm going to pass it to Dan, but I just want to make a comment. I really do believe as we look at that Q4 to Q1 that this is a realistic number. I just want to make sure that that's clear. I see this as a realistic number with balance on both sides, but realistic in the view that we have on it. And Dan can speak to some of the specifics around it.", "Dan Florin", "So Bob, in our prepared remarks, we talked about Q4 benefiting from a strong US market, which we had anticipated coming in for the quarter and then ended up being even slightly stronger than we initially guided to. So based on our models, we think knees are close to 3%, hips close to 2%, something in that range. So clearly a strong US market in hips and knees and shoulders and really procedurally across the board in the fourth quarter and difficult to precisely quantify how much of that\u2019s the hurricane. We came into the quarter signaling that could be as much as 30 basis points. ", "I'd probably stick with that type of an estimate. In terms of strength in the US market, we call that Asia-Pacific. Asia-Pac, really since the merger closed, continues to post above market growth on a consistent basis. The team is driving excellent execution in Japan, China, other countries as well. The stocking orders or the distributor orders in the fourth quarter also did benefit us. And then dental actually was stronger than we had expected on Q4. Now, as we approach Q1, we bring in a lot of factors. ", "We do our best at looking at the past number of years in terms of seasonality from a stronger than expected Q4 and what that may look like in Q1. So as we said in the prepared remarks, where our assumption is that the worldwide orthopedic market does step down a little bit more than normal into Q1, as a result of the strength in Q4. So that's an element. We talked about the billing day differences, the Asia-Pac step down because of the absence of distributor orders in Q1 and the UK, the NHS announcing that they were going to push elective procedures out through February due to some capacity constraints that they have over there.", "And the last part would be, based on the strength of Q4, I think it's fair to assume that our field inventory levels on high running brands are really still depleted. And that will recover as the year progresses. So hopefully that gives you a sense of the tailwinds and the headwinds in to Q1.", "Operator", "We will now move to David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.", "David Lewis", "Just a quick clarification on Bob\u2019s question, there is a lot of factors Bryan and Dan that vary from fourth quarter to first quarter. The one factor that does not appear to be a headwind, fourth to first is some change in the supply related dynamics. It sounds like fourth to first, supply is either at or better than it was in the fourth quarter. Is that a fair way of thinking about it?", "Dan Florin", "Yes. That\u2019s a good assumption. To me, it\u2019s a non-variable when you look at the difference between Q4 and Q1.", "David Lewis", "And then Bryan, kind of a strategic and financial question for you. I mean, if you got the guidance the first quarter and obviously it doesn't reflect necessarily all 2018, your gross margin is pretty close to what we thought. There does appear to be a little more incremental SG&A investments, some of that was compensation, which we knew about, but it does appear that you are going to reinvest in this business. Could you share with us a little bit about where you think that reinvestment needs to go? I think most investors are supportive of you doing it. Any thoughts you have on where you think it's needed I think could be helpful for people and then I had one quick follow up for Dan or you.", "Bryan Hanson", "So I am 100% on the same page. We've got to have investment. We -- as an organization, we\u2019ve been chasing the bottom line because we've had top line misses. And as a result of that, just obvious thing that we should have been doing to invest for growth is to have them happen in those moments, for all the right reasons, but the impact of that is negative now because we've got some catchup that we need to do. The things that we're going to be concentrating on is obviously investing for growth as a primary vehicle for growth. There is going to be two kind of pieces to this. ", "We're going to have a biased near-term growth I think you guys would want that as well, but inside of it we\u2019re still going to make sure that we earmarked money for research and development. We've got to spend more on research and development and bring on innovations that don't just help us in the near term, but also help us in the longer term. So, some of the money will go to R&D and unfortunately, there will be a longer tail to the impact of that from a revenue recognition standpoint. But that will be where some of the money goes. ", "The rest of the money is going to focus on the commercial organization, which is really where we can invest, take advantage of the portfolio we already have and I see that in just broader investments in commercial structure to be able to have more feet on the street, some of those being specialized so that we can take advantage of the opportunity in SET, but a lot of it will be focused on just driving incremental feet on the street, focused on driving the portfolio we already have and taking advantage of the new products that we're going to be launching and very importantly, beginning to diversify our growth engines in to sports extremities and trauma.", "David Lewis", "And then just last question for me is just, this quarter is sort of remarkable within hips and knees for a couple of reasons. One, it's the strongest hip and knee quarter you posted in a year, but it's also against the strongest pricing headwind I think you've seen in two years. I think you\u2019ve talked about the factors of that hip and knee momentum that may not occur in the first quarter, but Dan or Bryan, what is that pricing number, 3.5% in hips and knees, was that sort of mix related in the fourth quarter and how do we think about that number heading into 2018?", "Bryan Hanson", "Dave, we've seen fluctuations quarter-to-quarter on price declines. So at a company level, negative 2.9% in the fourth quarter, Q3 was negative 2.1%, so actually below the average. So second half was down 2.5%, first half was down 2.5%. So we're not concerned about that. We're still operating in that type of a range. Clearly when you get some distributor orders, you get some customer mix that comes into that map, but overall we still see price decline in the band that we've been experiencing recently.", "Operator", "Our next question will be from Matt Taylor of Barclays.", "Matt Taylor", "So I just wanted to follow up on that pricing question. I was curious because of the magnitude of this quarter. Do you think that your supply constraints are impacting your ability to get price or negatively impacting price at all or is this just within a regular band variance?", "Bryan Hanson", "Yeah. We're definitely looking at it right now as a -- just a variation that occurs, probably more due to mix. If you think about APAC for instance with the strength that we saw in the quarter, for the same products in APAC, you typically get a little lower price and so that mix, I'm sure, has some play in to the quarter, but we're not looking at this as something that\u2019s sustained or that we're worried about increasing over the next 12 months. And when I think about the supply constraints, I don't feel that the organization is putting price reductions in place to retain customers, which I think is what you're asking. So I don't feel that that's happening right now and we've got pretty good controls over pricing flexibility in the field and our confidence level that that's not occurring.", "Matt Taylor", "And just to follow up on the supply discussion, we noticed that you had taken off extremities from the watch list in the presentation, you didn't mention that they were constrained. I guess my question is can you talk about some of the lines of product that have improved or not improved and just remind us sort of where you are constrained now.", "Bryan Hanson", "Yeah. Just quickly that might have been just an oversight, the extremities as we've been talking about, continue to be constrained as a result of the North campus. So I'm not sure what we missed that, but that would be consistent with what we said before. It is still impacted and what I would say is that generally, the way I think about supply recovery is this and again this is coming from direct interaction with the field. Even though we're getting rolling recoveries, certain categories are getting more healthy than others. The sales organization is still waiting to get the full recovery. They still are concerned when we have other issues with other products that we're going to creep into the spaces that we've already recovered, because we've had lapses like that in the past. So it kind of goes back to that trust piece.", "Even though things are recovering, they\u2019re waiting for full -- truly a full comprehensive product recovery before they go on the offensive. So, I think we're not seeing the translation yet even in those areas for recovery, because people are waiting to get it all there so they know they can go on the offensive. A perfect example of that, Dan maybe you can provide the Oxford in what you\u2019ve heard on \u2013", "Dan Florin", "Sure. Yeah. I think Bryan\u2019s point is an important one, which is that lack of trust in the field, the hesitancy to go on offense and the need to have the full bag in order to truly drive offense. So, there are brands out of the North campus that we've restored to full supply as we expected, but the translation to revenue acceleration and that timeline that Bryan is talking about is an important distinction. Part of that is trust, part of it is the duration of the supply situation, but still feel very optimistic that out over time, we're going to bring all of the supply and new products together to drive that acceleration into 2019.", "Matt Taylor", "You want to give maybe the specific examples, because I think it really kind of remains true with even telling the sales organization, we're in full supply in Oxford and seeing a delay.", "Bryan Hanson", "Sure. Yeah. With Oxford, we\u2019re at full supply in Oxford, entering the fourth quarter. We're excited to have the Persona partial knee in there as well. So now you've got a full bag of mobile bearing and fixed bearing in the partial knee space. But still even with that full supply of Oxford, saw some delay in terms of the revenue uptake on Oxford. It's taking longer than we expected to see that accelerator. So that\u2019s I think a proof point of what we're describing.", "Operator", "We will now move to our next question and that will be from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank.", "Kristen Stewart", "Just kind of I guess big picture for you, I guess to what extent, I guess, are you still excited about costs taking kind of a life of its own, I kind of feel what extent do you still feel very optimistic about the future for Zimmer, because I feel like this -- you've kind of pointed out a lot more of the risk factors. So maybe if you could take a step back and talk about maybe some of the things that you've kind of come in and looked at Zimmer, the pluses and the minuses, since taking over the helm six weeks ago that you might be more excited about longer term as you look at the company more strategically over the next several years? Is it just kind of your view of looking at Zimmer from an orthopedic Company, can you maybe talk about how you may look at Zimmer from shaping the company more directionally? Is it diversification? Is it just getting the company back to -- are you satisfied with a low single digit growth rate? Can you just talk more directionally over kind of a longer term perspective?", "Bryan Hanson", "Yeah. So Kristen, first, I'm going to correct you. This is Zimmer Biomet, not Zimmer and I think it's important because one of the key things that I'm going to be concentrating on is culture in this organization in some of the things that are in a way of that culture creation right now is we just haven't yet become a fully integrated new organization. There's still camps of Zimmer and Biomet and we need to create the Zimmer Biomet, forget the legacy companies. And sorry to do that, but I think I would be remiss in not doing that because I know that my own team is listening right now. So that was a focus from them.", "So just to give you a sense for, I kind of like to think about things that I experience over the last month that maybe I didn\u2019t like as much as I would have expected and then things that I like more than what I expected. And then maybe I can kind of distill that to say, based on those things, how am I feeling about accepting the job and the future of the company. I\u2019ll start with the negative and finish it with the positive.", "The things that I probably experienced in a more negative way than I expected is just the complexity and the challenges, the scope of the challenges associated with quality remediation and supply recovery. It's more complex than I think I assumed when I came in. So that would be on the negative side obviously. The culture gap, which was kind of what I was just referencing on the Zimmer Biomet discussion we just had is wider than I expected. ", "And I got to tell you that this organization, because of what they've been through, throughout the organization, is fatigued. I can feel the fatigue in the organization and when the culture is not rock solid, that fatigue is exponential, right? And I think that's the issue that I'm seeing and that was -- it's probably not as good as I was even hoping. So those would be the things that on the negative side I\u2019ve experienced over the last 30 days or so.", "On the positive side, we\u2019ve got great employees and I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in skip level meetings, one-on-ones, just walking around, popping in people's cubicles, spending time out in the sales organization, spending time in our factories. We have a solid team in the sales organization as I think I've said already is even better than I thought. We have a first class sales organization. I didn't. Like I said, that\u2019s a surprise, but it's a relief, right. The portfolio is very attractive. I thought that coming in, but I'm hearing from our surgeons partners that we have the deepest, broadest portfolio in the industry that is the access to what obviously and they're very excited about the portfolio of products we're going to launch, so that my confidence level there is higher than it's ever been.", "This kind of surgeon loyalty and again I've spent time specifically with surgeons and the stickiness associated with that customer is better than I've ever seen in any business that I've been with. And so that\u2019s a surprise on the positive side. Here's one of, maybe a little softer, but it is really important to me, the employees that I've met feel very open to me, most desire a different form of leadership, a more inspirational positive form of leadership and this is something that I love to bring. And so I'm not feeling any resistance at all to it. I'm feeling an acceptance of it and that obviously is one of the things that I was hoping for, but I'm realizing and it\u2019s still kind of, it\u2019s still these things.", "I feel and I think the takeaway has got to be this. The cadence of recovery may not be what you were hoping for, but my confidence level right now is better than ever that this business is going to get turned around, I\u2019m 100% confident it's going to happen based on what I'm seeing. And to answer your question further, once we get to that stability place and we get our fair share of the market where I already play in, then I do want to take a step back and take a look to say, are we in the right markets to allow for a better weighted average market growth and ultimately through that weighted average market growth, allow us to grow in that mid-single digit growth rate at some point in the future, because that's the only way you're going to get to double digit EPS growth on a consistent basis.", "And so I don't want to go there yet. I'm not always patient, but right now I'm trying to be patient, put that on the back burner. Let's get to health first and then ultimately let\u2019s take a look at the portfolio and make the right decisions. So hopefully that answers your question.", "Kristen Stewart", "And then just one for Dan I guess and maybe you I guess in terms of just the guidance, what is the main sticking point or what's the main catalyst in terms of determining what the investment trigger is going to be? Is it mainly just what the right level of spend is for the remediation? Is that why they\u2019re hesitant to push off into the first quarter to get 2018 guidance in terms of giving why not a wide range for 2018 and set a no range for 2018 since you\u2019re giving SG&A and gross margin guidance?", "Bryan Hanson", "I will just give you my viewpoint on it, Kristen and then Dan, he will provide any color. When I look at this as I\u2019ve mentioned, there are a lot of moving pieces and parts right now, pretty material events that need to happen here over the relatively short term. And until we get through some of those and in either one burn down risk as a result of passing those milestones or experience risk, I think that we just want to be cautious in giving you guidance until we get a little smarter on those topics. ", "And the only thing that's going to make us smarter beyond the assumptions that we made is actually pushing through the milestones and experiencing the good or the bad. And when we get to the earnings call after Q1, we're going to be a lot smarter on that topic. And so we're really just trying to enable guidance for you that is more realistic and more informed and that's the reason why we\u2019re delaying. There isn't a specific thing. There are a number of things that are pushing us in that direction.", "And Dan, I don\u2019t know if you have any other color around it?", "Dan Florin", "Well, Kristen, I would just say that we've tried to give you some markers on certain elements of the P&L so that you can reflect those in your models. Look, I would expect that the consensus estimates for both revenue and EPS are probably going to come down after today in light of what we have shared, but that does not diminish at all the long term opportunity that Bryan has talked about.", "Operator", "We will now take a question from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Can we also take a look at what the milestones are or the steps are in our near term that will increase our confidence in giving the guidance or just over the next 12 months. I feel like we have some sweeping verbiage on execution in North Campus facility and supply, but is there a way to get just a little bit more granular on what really needs to be checked off?", "Bryan Hanson", "Yeah. Probably, one of the and I'm not going to get into too much detail, but I think just probably when we think about supply recovery, which I think all of us would agree is one of the most important components of that revenue acceleration we've been talking about, the first and foremost, you've got to again kind of bifurcate the activities that we've got in place, one of these is taking those processes that are most important to us with high volume products that are non-automated in the North campus and moving them to contract manufacturing that ultimately have a more automated process, proven track record of supplying products like these for others in the industry and transitioning that volume to them. ", "Just inside that one piece, that has to go right, this is not just one or two codes, these are families of codes. There's a lot of the SKUs that have to go through this process. There is a verification, and validation process that ensues. And there's nothing you can really do to speed this up. It's time sequence because a lot of it would be like fatigue testing for instance for an implant, but you can get through a million different iterations or movements with this product to check speed testing, find out that it fails, because you got to get 5 million. Then you got to find out why it failed and restart the whole process.", "So verification and validation is something that sounds very easy and ultimately we will absolutely get through it, but things always go wrong inside of that and you got to restart the clock as a result. So one of the biggest things that I'm focused on is what is our target dates associated with families that we have that we're moving out on that verification and validation timeframe, when do we think that should close, right? And so when we hit those and we passed them and that will be, we should hit all of those before the quarter earnings call. And so we'll get a lot smarter on whether or not we had major issues or not. ", "That's just one example of things that need to go right to be able to get that supply recovery because the only pathway to full capacity is through that contract manufacturing. On the other side of the coin, when you look at our factory in the North Campus and one of the big things that Mike mentioned is, the FDA still has to come in and sanction what it is we're doing with suppliers -- and with the quality remediation. We have a great team working on this. We've been working on it for a month. We're spending a lot of money in this area and a lot of effort of senior management and we have consultants that I think are some of the top notch folks in the industry following us on this and giving us their unbiased view of whether or not we're achieving what we said. ", "But at the end of the day, the FDA has got to come in and look at what we're doing and agree with us. If they for whatever reason come in and disagree and there are further things we have to take action on with remediation, that could impact our ability to supply product out of that North Campus. These are just two examples of pretty significant things that we just got to have time to tell us whether we're on the right track. There are many others. I want to oversimplify, but those are pretty big milestones.", "Joanne Wuensch", "And then a little bit more of a specific question. Can you pull apart a little bit what's going on in your spine and CMF franchise, as it relates to LDR and then the broader market?", "Bryan Hanson", "So if I kind of break those businesses up, within spine and CMF, obviously two different businesses, but CMF is actually doing pretty well. That's a solid team that we have, good strategy that continues to deliver results and really help that overall franchise out. So, I\u2019d just say, kudos, let\u2019s keep doing what we\u2019re doing over there and get more of it. On the spine side, I think we've got all kinds of opportunity in spine. This is an amalgamation of different acquisitions over time, LDR being the most recent and where we're falling down right now is, the channel integration is not going as planned and we're experiencing, as we said in the comments, dissynergies associated with that channel integration.", "And just to be honest, we had to make some changes at the senior leadership team for that organization. We think we've got the right team in place right now. Now, got to get focused on reversing some of these dissynergies and getting a better channel strategy in place. I do believe that can happen. It\u2019s going to take time because just looking at it, it's not anywhere where we needed to be and that we've got to unwind some of the things that have occurred there. But at the end of the day, when that gets past us, we have a very full portfolio that's exciting for our customers and exciting for our sales reps. We just don\u2019t have the channel strategy to implement it right now.", "Operator", "And that question will come from Richard Newitter of Leerink Partners.", "Richard Newitter", "I was hoping to just on the outlook that you plan to provide next quarter and I appreciate you don't want to go too far in advance of yourself, but maybe just the question is a little bit more on the process. Coming off of a period here, where we haven't been able to fully bank on kind of the given timelines or thresholds that you provided, what's going to change in the way that you approach kind of the under promises over deliver and within the context of you seem a lot of things that are out of your control, how should we be thinking about when you do provide that outlook? What kind of bottoms up processes you need to change at the organization so that you feel confident that whatever you do provide, we can kind of take at face value?", "Bryan Hanson", "So some of the things that I've learned over the years and I've been blessed by working with two very good companies, Covidien with a lot of time there and Medtronic more recently. And on the Covidien side, there is a level of discipline and rigor that I received from my old boss and mentor [indiscernible] and that rigor and discipline will be something that we put in place here and I'm not saying it doesn't exist, but the level of focus that I will have with this team in putting a process together that allows us to feel more confident in the guidance that we give will be something that we do. And not new to me and there is a process that I'm used to following and we're going to make sure that we bring that here.", "And we've got good people to be able to do it. It's just a -- it's a level of discipline and rigor that I've seen that I want to make sure that we have here as well. So that's one piece and I think it would be helpful, we\u2019re obviously not ready to give 2018 guidance, certainly not anything beyond that, but I do want, again with this idea of full transparency, I want to give everyone a view of kind of what I'm thinking about this right now and I kind of again think about it in three major components that we've got to get in front of us here.", "The first one as I've already talked about is supply recovery and I don't want to forget that supply recovery is the first step. The second step is translating that supply recovery into actual revenue acceleration, right? And I\u2019ve talked a little bit about why I think some delays could occur there, but that's got to happen. It's got to be supply recovery acceleration as a result. Second piece is, we\u2019re going to launch these products, excellent product pipeline that I\u2019ve talked about and we got to get to full launch as quickly as we can. I'm seeing that as being somewhere in the mid-2019 timeframe but that has to happen and we've got to do it effectively, right?", "And then the second -- the third piece to me is really around this idea of culture shift. I know that people consider it soft. It is a very important thing to me and right now, we have gaps in the culture and we've got to enhance the culture. So those three things need to happen. I just think logically about those from supply recovery and resulting acceleration, that's going to happen later in the year guys. It's later than what you've been thinking, because translating that into revenue growth is going to take longer than maybe what you're assuming. ", "I already said the pipeline is really full swing in mid-2019 and anyone who's done any kind of a culture change knows that it takes time. We're having immediate impact in this area. We're going to get quick results out of the gate, but to make it sustainable, it's just going to take time. It's a continuous improvement game. So when I just kind of put all those things together, I think realistically the way we should be thinking about this is a gradual recovery towards market growth if you will through 2019. ", "So think about it in that way. That's where I am. I'm going to get smarter on this topic. I'm going to learn more as we go and the very things that we just said as we burn down risk areas, but this is the way I'm thinking about it today. Some of you may have a hope for a faster recovery than that and I get it and potentially maybe it can be, which is based on everything that I'm seeing right now, I'm setting the expectation that I think is realistic that that's probably not probable. Okay. It is likely going to be what I just said. It would be a gradual recovery through 2019. So hopefully that helps provide color, at least in the way we're thinking about the business right now.", "Bryan Hanson", "Okay. I think that\u2019s the last question. I like to -- we just threw a pot at you in a very short period of time. Some of it probably stuff you didn't want to hear, didn\u2019t expect to hear. At the end of the day, the whole idea behind this from my perspective and Dan\u2019s is, we want to be as transparent with us as we possibly can and that was the intent of the conversation today. Let you know what we know, up to a reasonable point obviously. We didn\u2019t get to this place overnight and you shouldn't expect us to be able to recover from it any time soon. It's going to take some time to get there. ", "That said, based on everything I've learned, I am more confident than ever that this business is going to turn around. Although the pacing may not be what you expected or hoped for, I'm 100% confident that the end game is going to be something you're going to be very happy about. So thanks so much. I appreciate you joining the call today. I'm looking forward to connecting with you between now and earnings call, I\u2019m sure, through various events, but really looking forward to connecting on the first quarter earnings call as we give guidance for 2018. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "And thank you again for participating in today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.
