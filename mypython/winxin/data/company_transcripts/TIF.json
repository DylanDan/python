Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Tiffany & Company Fourth Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today's call is Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations; and Michael Kowalski, Chairman of the Board and Interim Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Mark Erceg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "At this time, I like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead.", "Mark Aaron", "Thank you, Jennifer. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2016 conference call. I am delighted that Tiffany's Chairman of the Board and Interim CEO, Mike Kowalski and our CFO, Mark Erceg, are on today\u2019s call. We will review actual results and comment on the 2017 outlook and then we will allow time to answer some questions. ", "Before proceeding, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the planned, assumed, or expected results expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements.", "Additional information concerning factors, risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the news release filed today under cover of Form 8-K. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, except as required by applicable law or regulation.", "Okay. By now I hope you have had a chance to read today\u2019s news release which indicated fourth quarter and full year results that were in line with the guidance that we provided in January and reaffirmed last month. Worldwide net sales rose slightly in the fourth quarter and earnings per diluted share declined slightly. ", "For the full year, worldwide net sales declined 3%, diluted EPS declined 1% on a GAAP basis, and 2% when excluding charges in both years and we managed our balance sheet effectively generating strong cash flow in the year.", "So let us review the results starting with the top line. First there were no meaningful changes in regional sales mix in 2016 with the Americas representing 46% of worldwide sales; Asia Pacific at 25%; Japan at 15%; and Europe at 11%. ", "In the Americas, total sales and comparable store sales declined both in the fourth quarter and the year as a result of lower jewelry units sold. In the US, we experienced softness across most of the countries for the year, although at lesser rates in some stores as the year progressed. In addition to the full year sales weakness in Canada was partly offset by growth in Latin America. We attributed a portion of the softness in the US throughout the year to local customers, which we believe was tied to macro-market and political uncertainties.", "Sales attributed to foreign visitors declined in the full year, which we attribute to lower spending by Chinese visitors, but we believe total sales benefited in the second half of the year due to increased spending by Japanese tourists. We estimate that US sales in 2016 for foreign tourists remained at approximately 20%.", "We have previously spoken about the impact of post-election activities near our New York Flagship Store, which represents less than 10% of worldwide sales. While we typically do not discuss individual store results, we are for at least this quarter reporting its sales results because of the unique situation and level of investor interest. Sales in the New York Flagship declined 11% in the full year and 7% in the entire fourth quarter versus a 14% decline in the November December holiday period due to some large transactions in January.", "In addition, we estimate spending by foreign tourists in that store remained at roughly 40% of its annual sales. Elsewhere during 2016 we opened one store in Canada in the Holt Renfrew department store in Toronto, relocated our store in Holt Renfrew in Vancouver, and relocated our store in the King of Prussia Mall outside Philadelphia. Of course, we also continued to renovate many stores, highlighted by magnificent upgrades to our stores in Beverly Hills and San Francisco. ", "Turning to Asia-Pacific, while total sales were roughly unchanged in the year we were pleased to see a healthy rate of growth in the second half and fourth quarter that was generated by increases in jewelry units sold. During the year, we were very pleased with strong total and comparable store sales growth in Mainland China as we believe the Tiffany & Co. brand continues to gain in recognition and prominence with customers.", "I should add that lower spending that we attributed to Chinese tourists in other regions in 2016 may have led to some of the higher spending that we saw by local consumers within China. Also in the greater China market we were pleased to see smaller sequential sales declines in Hong Kong as the year progressed. However, there was noteworthy softness in much of the year in Australia and Taiwan.", "We significantly enhanced our store presence in Asia Pacific in 2016. We opened seven stores, relocated two and closed three. In China, we opened three stores in Ningbo-Heyi, in Tianjin incense, and in Shenzhen-Mixc, and we closed two stores, one in Beijing in the Peninsula Hotel and one in the Tianjin Friendship Store. We finished the year with 31 stores in Mainland China.", "In addition, we opened our 15th store in Korea in the Shinsegae Gangnam Department Store. We opened our first store in New Zealand in Auckland\u2019s magnificent Britomart precinct. And we opened two stores in Australia, one in the Gold Coast Pacific Fair and one in the Sydney Airport. And in Singapore, we relocated our store at Changi Airport and closed our store in Raffles Hotel.", "In Japan, we achieved healthy retail sales growth in 2016 even excluding the favorable translation benefit from the stronger yen, and finished the year on a strong note. We were pleased to have an increase in jewelry units sold in the fourth quarter and full year in Japan that spanned most categories.", "Anecdotally, we believe our already strong presence in Japan further benefited from the brand exposure we received on a popular television show called [for the romantic], which aired in the July-September time frame. In addition, we believe that the stronger yen has been a factor contributing to the increased purchasing attributed to Japanese tourists that we have experienced in other regions.", "Conversely that stronger yen has likely been the reason for lesser tourist spending in Japan primarily attributed to Chinese visitors, which reversed the trend we saw in 2015. However, we believe our sales in Japan are made largely by Japanese customers and we continue to estimate that spending by foreign tourists represented less than 10% of sales in Japan. Lastly in Japan we had a net reduction of one store in 2016 as we closed the store in the [Indiscernible], while we relocated two stores during the year in Nagoya and Kagoshima. ", "Conversely it was a challenging year a Europe. Total sales declined on a reported basis in the fourth quarter and full year, partly reflecting weakening European currencies. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales declined to a lesser extent in the year and actually rose slightly in the fourth quarter. The sales weakness arose largely from lower jewelry unit volume across all categories.", "Throughout the year, we experienced varying degrees of soft demand partly attributed to local customers that we believe is the result of economic and political condition, and also attributed to lower spending by foreign tourists likely tied to the effects of the tragic events in Paris and elsewhere. ", "We estimate that spending attributed to foreign tourists generally represents in the neighborhood of one quarter to one third of total European sales. In both the fourth quarter and the full year results were soft across much of continental Europe, while sales on a constant exchange rate basis in the UK, which represents roughly 40% of European sales \u2013 sales rose in the UK, which represents about 40% of European sales.", "In fact we believe the sales lift that we saw in the UK in the second half of the year was from spending attributed to foreign tourists after the British pound declined following the Brexit vote. Built three stores in Europe in 2016, including two in Italy on Rome\u2019s Via dei Condotti and in Venice, and a second store in Amsterdam in the De Bijenkorf department store, and we closed a small store in the Frankfurt Airport.", "I commented several times on the significance of spending attributed to foreign tourists in most regions. In general, tourism flows from one region to another maybe affected by changes in currency values as well as geopolitical and other external factors. Therefore we believe that creating and reinforcing local and global brand recognition is most relevant to growing our business regardless of where we are spending money in the short-term.", "Lastly, lower sales in our other segment in both the fourth quarter and full year resulted from comp store sales decline in our five stores in the United Arab Emirates. Also [store sales] increased in the full year, but were roughly unchanged in the fourth quarter.", "In terms of store productivity, worldwide sales per gross square foot for company operated stores was $2700 in 2016 compared with $2900 in 2015 resulting from the 3% increase in worldwide gross square footage and the modest worldwide sales decline. ", "By region, sales productivity in 2016 ranged from $3800 in Asia Pacific to $3700 in Japan to $2500 in Europe and to $2200 in the Americas. Keep in mind that these productivity levels are calculated in US dollars and therefore year-over-year differences also reflect foreign-currency changes.", "Our strategies partly revolve around optimizing our worldwide store base through openings, relocations, renovations and closings. We expect this to result in increasing global square footage by approximately 2% a year for the foreseeable future. This initiative goes hand-in-hand with our strategy to more proactively reach customers to deliver a more engaging shopping experience, to deepen long-term relationships with customers and ultimately to increase the frequency of store business and the conversion rates.", "Beyond the Tiffany & Co. we operate in 28 countries, we also serve customers through e-commerce enabled websites in 13 of those countries. Worldwide e-commerce sales were approximately unchanged in the year, and continued to represent 6% of Tiffany's worldwide sales, but were somewhat a higher percentage in the US alone.", "As we have said many times, our website serve an important dual function of generating online sales but also delivering marketing communication that drives awareness and store traffic. That covers regional sales results. ", "Looking at the products side, from a sales perspective trends indicate a general softness across all jewelry categories to varying degrees. Despite that there were some noteworthy product related highlights in 2016. During the year, we introduced some new designs, refreshed some existing collection and importantly have said that we intend to accelerate the pace of doing this going forward. ", "A relative improvement that we have seen in fashion jewelry sales can be attributed to higher gold jewelry sales, exemplified by the T collection, which we have continued to build upon with new designs. ", "We also saw relative improvement in fashion silver jewelry in 2016 led by the popularity of the new Return to Tiffany Love collection with silver jewelry sales approaching stabilization after years of decline. We focused on product newness in silver jewelry in 2016 and grew the number of new items under $500 by more than 10%.", "I should also mention success in our designer jewelry category, which we are now disclosing on its own. Driven by Elsa Peritti\u2019s jewelry collection, highlighted in 2016 by her exquisite Diamonds by the Yard and the Open Heart design, and the designs of Paloma Picasso, highlighted by her popular olive leaf, and her New Paloma's Melody collection.", "The engagement jewelry and wedding bands category posted mixed sales performance by region during the year, although we were pleased to see unit volume growth in the quarter and the full year on a worldwide basis. Relatively speaking [Indiscernible] this product activity was high, fine and solitary jewelry.", "We continue to be pleased with the success of our Victoria collections in platinum and diamond. However there was some softness at the highest end in this category. We had held our Blue Book event this spring attended by global audience as we do every year and the results while strong did not measure up to the huge success of those events in the prior two years. You should note that the term high jewelry now replaces the former term statement jewelry.", "Lastly, I will just mention that we continue to see healthy sales growth in the watch category in 2016. While watch sales have grown albeit off of a low single-digit percentage of sales base, we see considerable opportunity over the longer term to expand that business through a combination of product developments and marketing medication.", "That covers the top line review. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Mark Erceg.", "Mark Erceg", "Thanks, Mark, and welcome everyone. Let me start by stating that while fourth quarter and full year GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share both were in line with our expectations, Tiffany's financial performance over the past couple of years has been disappointing, which is why I am so pleased to be working with Mike Kowalski, the board and all of Tiffany's dedicated and talented employees to accelerate the execution of our key strategies in the years ahead.", "One of those strategies is expanding our e-commerce and omnichannel capabilities, which require us to upgrade certain IT systems. So I want to briefly comment on the $25.4 million impairment of capitalized software development costs we recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016. Simply put, as part of a comprehensive system review we identified a solution which negated the need to install a separate inventory management and merchandising system, which work had already begun on.", "By further leveraging our existing ERP system and the order management system we are in the process of implementing, we expect to be able to access the full range of capabilities we are originally seeking but at a lower cost. ", "This project, now that it has been [recast] along with the rest of the investments we are making in information systems will we believe make our supply-chain more efficient, improve the customers\u2019 in-store experience and generate incremental sales by expanding and leveraging both our CRM and omnichannel capabilities.", "Let us now look at the rest of the income statement. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 64.1%, which was up 110 basis points versus a year ago. In fact gross margin increased year-over-year in every quarter as we benefited from favorable product input costs, 2015 pricing actions, which carried over into 2016 and a favorable shift in product sales mix.", "For the full year gross margin was 62.2% versus 60.7% last year, but unfortunately the 150 basis points of gross margin expansion generated during 2016 was more than offset by increases in SG&A expense.", "SG&A expense as a percent of sales for the fourth quarter was 43.2%, up 170 basis points versus year ago and for the year was 44.2%, which was up 200 basis points. The increases in SG&A expense as a percent of sales reflected sales deleveraging due to higher store occupancy and depreciation costs as well as higher labor and incentive compensation costs. Lowering the rate of SG&A expense growth as a percent of sales remains a top priority for the company going forward. ", "Marketing spending as a percent of sales was roughly unchanged from the prior year. We continue to broaden Tiffany's presence in a variety of media, and as an example appeared on television in February with our first Super Bowl commercial. A 60-second ad, which ran in 10 key markets, featured Lady Gaga in order to set the stage for our new HardWear jewelry collection, which is launching next month.", "Net interest and other expenses in the fourth quarter and for the full year were below prior year due to both reduced foreign currency transaction losses and lower interest expense. Tiffany's full year effective tax rate was 34.1%, which was down from last year\u2019s rate of 34.7% due to the favorable impact from the conclusion of a tax examination in the first quarter.", "Turning to the balance sheet and statement of cash flow, we finished the year with reasonable debt levels and generated strong cash flow, both of which gives us the ability to continue investing in our business while also returning excess cash to shareholders. Inventory finished the year 3% below year ago at $2.2 billion.", "Accounts receivable at January 31st were 10% higher than the previous year end with the increase partly tied to the timing of collections driven by sales growth in Japan since the majority of our stores in that market are operated within department stores. A portion of the increase was also currency related.", "Capital expenditures for the year came in at $223 million with more than half of the spending related to the opening, renovation and/or relocation of stores. Capex represented approximately 6% of worldwide sales during both 2016 and 2015. It is also worth pointing out that we made an unplanned and voluntary contribution of $120 million to Tiffany's US pension plan during the fourth quarter of 2016. We expect this to lower our 2017 pension expense as a result of incremental returns expected to be generated on the investments made with that contribution and lower premiums owed to the PBGC.", "Putting it all together we generated $702 million of operating cash flow and $479 million of free cash flow in 2016 after giving effect to the $120 million voluntary pension contribution. Importantly this was well above our initial goal of generating at least $400 million of free cash flow for the year.", "In terms of share repurchases, we spent $184 million and bought more than 2 million shares in 2016. Turning to dividends, we increased the quarterly dividend by 12.5% in May, which marked the 15th dividend increase in the past 14 years.", "We finished fiscal 2016 with $986 million of cash and short-term investments versus $1.1 billion short-term and long-term debt. So total debt represented just 37% of stockholders equity, which was unchanged from the prior year. Tiffany's return on assets was 9% and return on stock orders equity was 15%, both of which are generally consistent with our long-term objectives, which call for a return on assets of at least 10% and a return on equity of at least 15%.", "Looking into 2017, our financial expectations recognize two important external challenges. First, we remain mindful of economic and geopolitical uncertainties and their potential effects on both local and foreign tourist spending. Second, since over half our sales continue to be outside the United States and we expect the US dollar to be stronger on average than the prior year, we should be facing a sizable headwind in terms of translating our non-US sales into dollars.", "In addition, we will have to overcome the negative effect a stronger dollar may have on foreign tourist spending in the United States. Of course, we do openly acknowledge that we will partly benefit from the translation effect of non-US expenses into dollars but that positive impact is expected to be relatively minor compared to the two foreign exchange headwinds I just mentioned.", "We plan to open 11 stores in 2017, half in Asia Pacific, relocate 9 and close 6, representing a net 3% increase in global square footage. As part of our strategy to optimize the global store base we also continue to renovate some of our existing stores.", "With this in mind we expect total sales to increase by a low single-digit percentage over the prior year, which importantly translates into a mid single-digit increase over the prior year on a constant exchange rate basis.", "Moving further into the P&L our 2017 outlook assumes an increase in operating margin entirely due to an increase in gross margin with SG&A expense growth just slightly higher than sales growth. The assumption of higher gross margins tied to favorable product input cost and proactive expense management.", "In addition, [F&F] taking any meaningful price increases in 2016 expect for currency changes we took modest price increases in the past month that varied by country but averaged out to a low single-digit increase on a worldwide basis. Our 2017 outlook further assumes interest in other expenses net of approximately $40 million and effective tax rate consistent with the prior year and that we continue buying shares under our existing share repurchase program. Although we expect minimal benefits to diluted earnings per share from the current planned repurchases.", "Taking all this into account our outlook calls for net earnings per diluted share to increase by a high single-digit percentage from last year's $3.55 per share on a GAAP basis. And to increase by a mid single-digit percentage over the adjusted $3.75 per share last year. We also plan to manage the balance sheet efficiently but a particular focus on not growing that inventories. In order to generate net cash from operating activities approximately $700 million and free cash flow approximately $450 million for the full year. The difference of $250 million represents our planned capital expenditures.", "I am now pleased to turn the call over to Michael Kowalski for some brief comments before we open the call to your questions.", "Michael Kowalski", "Thank you gentleman for providing everyone with a thorough of understanding of Tiffany's performance in 2016. I just wanted to address few matters and then we will be happy to take your questions. First we began an external search in early February to fill the role of Chief Executive Officer when Fredric Cumenal stepped down from that position in order to become interim CEO. We assume that it may take time to find the right person with broad experience and broad management with the global perspective and who possess the strong leadership skills to motivate and inspire our Tiffany's colleagues around the world.", "Second although Tiffany luxury industry faced numerous challenges in 2016 we have not been pleased with our financial performance. While we were able to realize important improvement in gross margin and generate a healthy level of free cash flow sales results were disappointing. And we were unable to generate sales leverage on our fixed costs.", "Third and most importantly we believe that Tiffany has a set of powerful strategies that can propel our business forward in the long term. With the right leadership and pace of execution we believe there are substantial opportunities to grow our business. Specifically we are focused on increasing the rate of new product introductions and innovations and we recently announced the hiring of Reed Krakoff as Chief Artistic Officer. We are also focused on maximizing our marketing effectiveness and building stronger relationships with customers. Optimizing our store network and improving our business operations and processes all well effectively managing our capital and costs.", "And we remain absolutely committed to our industry leading effort around corporate social responsibility and environmental sustainability an area of great importance and relevant to us and we believe to our customers as well. In essence we are committed to executing with excellence the strategies that are within our control and pursuing long term growth opportunities.", "This May 5, will mark the 30th anniversary of Tiffany's initial public offering in 1987. Since then our company has generally produced strong returns for shareholders. And we intend to pursue opportunities that could continue to generate attractive total shareholder return in the future.", "In my role as Interim CEO I have been actively engaged with the management team and employees across our business and I have no doubt that my colleague at all level share an extra ordinary sense of dedication and passion for our company. I truly appreciate their efforts. And all of you on this call I appreciate your ongoing interest in Tiffany's progress.", "And now I would be happy to answer some of your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instruction] We will go first to Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning this is Warren Chang on line for Omar. I just had a question on accelerating the pace of newness so at the Investor Day last year you discussed some ways that you are speeding up the processes of both product design and also the supply chain and bring product to market more quickly. What part of these assortment are turning faster than they were year ago and what's changed in terms of your structural capabilities to deliver on frequency and freshness?", "Michael Kowalski", "Certainly, this is Mike. Certainly the portion of the product assortment in which we delivered new greater newness at a greater pace is in fashion product. And I think we have seen the sales result to the extent the fashion has grown faster so we certainly continue our emphasis on that segment of the assortment. We have also had increase success with sales under the $500 price point and once again as we indicated on the call we have stabilized that segment and we hope to grow it. We have put \u2013 we have begun to put into place many of the innovations that we spoke of earlier to bring product to market. It's still relatively early stages but we are seeing progress and speed of bringing product and the efficiency with which we do it and then of course most importantly the arrival of Reed several weeks ago we believe will be yet another way to increase the pace of newness new product introduction. So at this point we are feeling good about 2017 and beyond.", "Mark Erceg", "We are also very pleased with the progress we are making in our jewelry search design center and we expect to have that fully online by the end of this fiscal year.", "Michael Kowalski", "We are definitely adding more resources in the whole product development, design and development area and you will see it play-out over the course of the next year.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thanks. Good luck this year.", "Mark Aaron", "Next question.", "Operator", "We will go next to Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America - Merrill Lynch", "Lorraine Hutchinson", "Thank you good morning. When you talk about increasing the pace of newness how should we be tracking that is it a number of new collections, number of products and then will Reed\u2019s impact these sales by holiday? Will you be able to get some product in the stores by then?", "Michael Kowalski", "Yes. Absolutely. It might begin \u2013 certainly there is a number of individual new products and collections in work. You will certainly see some of Reed\u2019s impact in holiday specifically you will see luxury collection accessories which are very, very exciting and non-jewelry collection you will see that on and around November. But I think you will manifest you will see the new product the pace of new product introduction manifest itself both ways both in individual new products, importing new collections or categories like luxury accessories. You will of course see important watch introduction in the second half of the year and obviously jewelry collections.", "Mark Erceg", "And Lorraine as we have historically said new jewelry designs in any one year represent less than 10% of our sales in that year the objective is ultimately to raise that to more than 10%.", "Lorraine Hutchinson", "Thank you.", "Mark Erceg", "Jenifer next question.", "Operator", "We will go next to Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company.", "Oliver Chen", "Hi, thank you. We had a longer term question in relation to supply chain. What are your thoughts regarding capacity utilization and how in your philosophy regarding vertical integration and the opportunities you see and as that relates to what you have been on a really good journey with the networking capital management and as we another topic was IT, I was just curious from a consumer facing perspective what features are you looking forward to having in terms of what consumers are demanding and what capabilities will be different in terms of what you are looking for over the next few years? Thank you.", "Michael Kowalski", "Thanks for the question. I will try and answer it in the order in which it was presented. So with respect to supply chain you\u2019re right we are very pleased with the vertically integrated nature of our supply chain. It does a number of things for us which is control the quality of the offering, which is control the pace and the speed of innovation which we are going to be accelerating ramping up even further with it towards research design center which will allows us to fast prototyping and also allow us to get really tight on the design specs so we can do a lot of design cost element thing work right up front which we are very pleased by.", "We have been looking at ways for us to maximize the efficiency of the team that we have in all areas and we have been doing a lot of additional training which is allowing us to cross views of the capacity that we do have within our internal system more efficiently and more effectively each and every year. So we are very pleased with what we are seeing on the supply chain side. With respect to IT it's an area of clear focus for us. We have been investing a lot behind it. We are confident that we are going to bringing forward a lot of additional capabilities that the consumers are going to be the direct beneficiary of as far as what we are focusing on right now. A lot of it has to do with client selling and I mean a lot of it has to do with our digital capabilities and the shopping experience more seamless for the customers all around the world.", "Oliver Chen", "Thank you and the question, we had a quick question Lady Gaga was an exciting kind of aspect of the brand. From a newness perspective what do you thinking about, how you are thinking about customers in terms of what you want to target, what's the opportunity and thinking about self purchasing versus gifting as you make \u2013 as you drive a lot of innovation in your portfolio and marketing?", "Mark Erceg", "Oliver, well I think certainly it's true that self purchase and gifting must move forward together self purchase greater degrees of self purchase have always been part of and has been an objective of this company for many, many years and I think to the extent that we are seeing relative strength in our fashion collections and individual fashion items that we are making progress and we will continue to make that a focus and at the same time our investment in luxury collection, luxury accessories and the gifting component of that also is critically important. We think that's terribly important because it's necessary to drive traffic into our store so we intend to move forward on all those fronts.", "Oliver Chen", "Thank you. Best regards.", "Mark Erceg", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer & Co Inc.", "Brian Nagel", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, the first question I have this with respect to guidance. There is an initial guidance that you put out for 2017 if I look at those middle figures particular at the top line number it does assume a better trend that we have seen recently at the chain and we have talked a lot of in prepared comments in response to some of the questions about newness. But how should we think about the drivers of that improved top line are there key factors that sort of say realize upon and then the second question is that how did the cadence of sales through the year. You expect better sales later in the year or should be relatively spread out through the year? Thank you.", "Mark Erceg", "Brian it's Mark. We are not talking about the cadence throughout the year, no quarterly guidance. So you will have to make your own assumptions on that. But clearly, with all of the initiatives that are happening here in terms of better engaging customers and here we are talking about product development and here we are talking about exciting innovations and marketing communication we have to make some assumptions and we think with all of these things happening we ought to be able to perform little bit better than we did in 2016.", "Michael Kowalski", "And let me just add returning here five or so weeks ago I have been terribly pressed by the number of initiatives again they are in various stages of development but there is an awful lot going on around here in terms of improving the store experience the Tiffany Touch customer service program that are gold setting in measurement around the Tiffany experience index which measures client's satisfaction. There is an awful lot happening and of course as we have spoken now with some length new pace of product introduction so I think we are reasonably confident that the goals that we have set in terms of sales and in 2017 are in fact achievable.", "Brian Nagel", "Got it. Thank you. In fact, one follow-up with one question. Thank you for that. With respect to it is obviously more focus on the U.S. business, domestic business but there is a lot of chatter out there within retail about the impact of declining mall traffic and recognizing Tiffany's located in the better malls but nonetheless is declining mall traffic at all something that's affecting the Tiffany business?", "Mark Erceg", "Yes I mean one of the reasons that of course it is we are certainly not immune to that and as we have said earlier one of the reasons that we are excited about the luxury accessories collection, the gift collection because it's designed very specifically to drive traffic in Tiffany store. The business that we walked away from slowly but consistently over the past ten years. And we think it's time to put that back. So we think that that can help traffic and finally again improvements in the store experience itself we are not immune to the decline in store traffic, but we think we have to do something about it on an individual store basis whatever maybe happening in the mall.", "Michael Kowalski", "We are also working proactively to make sure that Tiffany is relevant and acceptable wherever shoppers happen to be. So our true ship initiative is example way for us to make sure that we are evolving with the current times.", "Brian Nagel", "Well thank you very much. Best of luck for the year ahead.", "Mark Erceg", "Jenifer next question.", "Operator", "We will go next to Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "Thanks. Good morning everyone. One just one quick one for me first and then I will follow-up. The timing of Chinese New Year help your January accelerated from your holiday did timing of Chinese New Year helped at all with that potentially impact your first quarter?", "Michael Kowalski", "Yes I mean the shift did have some to January. It happened in the first quarter but clearly if we had some benefit in late January it worked the other way in the early February.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "Okay. Great and Mark I wanted to ask just now that you have been saw a little bit of timing I had a chance to really think deeply about you have talked about wanting to help improve efficiency with the business. Could you talk about some of the specific initiatives I know you talked a bit about this new order management systems but anything else as you think about strategies for 2017 and how can you improve the inventory efficiency or optimize the cost structure that would be helpful? Thank you.", "Mark Erceg", "Thank you very much for the question. I mean as with Mike, he made the comment and he was very pleased to see the enormous number of initiative that were being auctioned when he kind of parachuted back in I will tell you that there was a lot of things being done in a lot of good regards by a lot of really accounted people, which I am going to now in your partial beneficiary along with the shareholders that are out there and those of you on the call today.", "A lot of this is just basic locking enactment we have a global procurement group that's relatively early in its formation which is doing extremely good. We must get our arms around those global spend pools, we are able to negotiate harder and better with more visibility and with more impact. That's the key initiative I have mentioned earlier that newer research design center I don't want to overplay but I want to -- either being able to do fast prototyping on the ideas that Reed and his team are generating is going to put us well down the path of being able to design for efficiency in all of our internal production processes and frankly the loss allows for those items that we do choose to put out to external bid with tighter in that process as well. Clearly the systems that we have available to us today are going to be optimized in the years ahead and that's going to allow us do better assortment planning and with better assortment planning we will able to do more high level analytic that go along with that we will be able to get pricing in a lot more discrete ways we are going to be able to make sure that in each store we have the right product at the right time or is as much as practical versus what we have today in several pretty exciting initiatives all year marked in that regard.", "The plant structure as I indicated earlier is also doing a lot of really good work to cross train so that we have the ability to do multiple operations at multiple sites and that's allowing us to extract a lot more value and we are starting to play with some different technologies as well which we think over time will lead to some additional productivity gain. So there is a broad based basket of things that we are aggressively pursuing and I am confident that we are going to be able to affect our cost structures in a favorable way which allow us few additional money into other investment areas going forward.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "On the inventory side, I know for many years where Tiffany was lengthening out its inventory \u2013 its diamond inventory in order to safeguard against the shortage and supply and obviously diamond markets are little bit different today than back then. Is there an opportunity to extract more efficiency out of your diamond inventories by taking a less conservative approach to new guide inventory on hand?", "Michael Kowalski", "Short answer is yes and that's something we are actively engaged in as well. We are trying to make sure that we are getting the right collection of rough stones and then being able to quickly and efficiently process those is obviously an area of focus for us.", "Mark Erceg", "Yes I mean that's building up as a diamond supply chain was a ten year process and we are done. We are maxed out now there is an opportunities to identify ways to improve it.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Michael Kowalski", "Jenifer next question.", "Operator", "We will go next to Robert Drbul with Guggenheim Securities.", "Robert Drbul", "Hi and good morning. Mike welcome back.", "Michael Kowalski", "Thank you Bob.", "Robert Drbul", "I guess the question I have is can you comment a little bit about January flagship stores changed in January. And your assumptions in the 2017 around the flagship store?", "Mark Erceg", "Bob it's Mark. I will just mention in January the flagship store technically did very well. But that was really driven by couple of very large one off transaction. So we are not going to read too much into that but technically that's why you saw the flagship store down by considerably smaller amount in the fourth quarter versus what it had been in holiday period. And with the plan someone cautiously to the New York flagship store for 2017 but we are not going to share our assumptions with online store. And obviously we [indiscernible] service NYPD to maximize access to minimize the disruptions but it is large and beyond under our controls but we will do what we can. We also have obviously other stores here in the city which we can we will better utilize it as the year progresses. Yes.", "Robert Drbul", "Okay and I guess my second question would be when you look at the comp leverage point in the business overall do you see an opportunity to bring that down over the longer term from where we are right now?", "Mark Erceg", "I think you heard us say that with respect to SG&A in 2017, the SG&A growth as a percentage of sales will just be slightly ahead of our sales forecast. So that's something that we are very mindful of and it's something that we are going to be working hard in order to begin to make sure that we can fund all these investments areas that we think will really accelerate the top line for us. So we are definitely moving in that direction Bob again to find what we can resume getting leverage on SG&A.", "Robert Drbul", "Great. Thank you very much. Good luck. ", "Michael Kowalski", "Thanks Bob. Next question?", "Operator", "We will go next to Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.", "Dana Telsey", "Good morning everyone. Nice to hear the progress that you have been making so far on the product side and it also sounds like there is progress on the gross margin side. If you look at the opportunities going forward, what do you see for product import cost product input cost and also on the marketing spend and also Mike since you\u2019ve been back what's the biggest difference from when you left the operational role? Thank you.", "Michael Kowalski", "Real quickly on the input side what I would tell you is that we have been in a relatively favorable environment as it relates to both metal prices as well as rough and polished diamonds. We except that to continue through at least 2017 time horizon relatively long supply chain on rough and polished. So a lot of the cost visibility that we have in the 2017 is basically pretty tight and worn out by things that already come to past so to speak. And then with respect to our metals we tend to go out forward and lock in our metal pricing as well. So we are pretty confident about the gross margin plot that we spoke to in the context of our 2017 guidance.", "Mark Erceg", "And Dana in terms of what's changed again is I said a moment ago and as Mark indicated when he arrived few months ago. I think I am not surprised by it but certainly impressed by the number of initiatives underway both in terms of improved customers service the work that it's been doing around inventory productivity and efficiency and IT development and I think most importantly what hasn't changed is that this culture remains very strong and resilient and everyone at Tiffany despite the obvious challenges in terms of the changes continues to be passionate about the brand and confident in our future, Tiffany most certainly is one of the world's great luxury brand. It's not broken and everyone here is simply committed to making it greater so I feel really good.", "Dana Telsey", "Thank you.", "Michael Kowalski", "Thanks Dana.", "Operator", "We will go next to Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc.", "Laurent Vasilescu", "Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. The investment of [indiscernible] in cost savings budget in 2018 I think of which $30 million was close to P&L can you tell us how much closely in 2016, how much should we anticipate for 2017 and finally are there any opportunities to increase that $50 million target beyond 17?", "Mark Erceg", "Hi Laurent, it\u2019s Mark. In answer to the first part of your question we are definitely moving in that direction through savings that we already achieved in global procurement and savings that are anticipated we are not going to get more granular than that in terms of exactly how much it was in 2016 it will be 2017 but we are definitely hitting that target that we specified for 2018. And then the opportunities for cost savings beyond that I turn it to the other Mark here, but I think the answer is going to be we are always going to be looking for opportunities to run the business more profitability more efficiently.", "Mark Aaron", "I completely agree. And as I mentioned little while back the global procurement initiative is still in its early days. And we are finding enormous benefit from the work that's being done in that area and it's now starting to go into a lot of other areas of the business with respect to store design, case lines, lighting, we are finding enormous opportunities in all those areas. And we are very confident that as Mark said we will be able to achieve the target levels savings that we laid out by the indicated days not sooner.", "Michael Kowalski", "But Laurent, I will just add, ultimately we need better sales growth. I think that's the obvious. And if all of these initiatives we are pursuing generate better sales growth combined with what we are working on our expense side that's what will give us a return to good operating margin improvement.", "Laurent Vasilescu ", "Okay. Thank you. And as a quick follow-up your e-commerce sales have been relatively flat over the last two years are there opportunities for to get the double-digit percentage of sales and any update on that partnership would be appreciated?", "Michael Kowalski", "To say in terms of [indiscernible] we have been very pleased for the relationship with them and it's certainly -- but it's certainly possible that 6% of sales could gradually move up close to 8% or 10% and it\u2019s beyond some customers certainly opt more for shopping online and they will use our website more but everything is going to be a very large number because it's not the nature of our business.", "Mark Erceg", "Luxury accessories revamp that we are underway which that will lend itself we think to more e-commerce transaction in nature.", "Michael Kowalski", "Yes I think it's that critically important point that the disappoint sales growth in e-commerce over the year I think more than any years, recent years more than anything else is a function of merchandising assortment and the fact that we have not had growth in lower price point jewelry and of course there has been an absence of gifts. Those are gifts are being put back active product development in so in jewelry under $500 and that's going to have that should have an important impact on our ability to grow e-commerce sales because those are that's the heart of that business.", "Laurent Vasilescu ", "Thank you. And best of luck.", "Michael Kowalski", "Jenifer next question.", "Operator", "We will go next to Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley & Co.", "Kimberly Greenberger", "Thank you so much. Good morning. I am wondering if you can go through some of the revenue growth drivers that you have got in place, I know there are lot of macro factors impacting Tiffany's sales growth but knowing that there are certain aspects of sales growth that are in your control I think you have got a number of different strategies in place I think one would be the pace of innovation, you mentioned some development of additional service metrics in the stores. Could you just maybe take through the two or three or four or five different revenue growth strategies that you have got inflation and \u2013", "Michael Kowalski", "We have already touched on a few that are critically important so let me just add certainly enhanced client telling effort that are going to be informed by our new CSR systems something somewhat operational but it will have an impact on sales. It would be more intelligent client focused staffing programs in all of our stores where we are working very hard to improve the store experience built around better assortment and create a visual merchandising. Again, I think you referenced, I referenced also the Tiffany Touch customer service program I think so much of the effort around in addition to obvious new product development pace of new product development really is going to be built around enhancing all the attention of the customers in store experience.", "Mark Erceg", "As Mike said I am sorry CRM bias.", "Kimberly Greenberger", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Michael Kowalski", "Thanks Kimberly.", "Operator", "We will next to Betty Chen with Mizuho Securities.", "Betty Chen", "Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit more about [indiscernible] things like you saw unit growth there in 2016 for the quarter also it sounds like Hong Kong may have seen some sequential improvement maybe if you can share your thoughts with us on that region and also longer term any updates on how you read the Mainland China opportunity and any learning from some of the initial folly on how to maybe accelerate some of that growth? Thanks.", "Michael Kowalski", "Let me start with last part of your question because it's the easiest. We certainly see the Mainland if I can use that term Mainland China opportunity as continuing to be very, very significant and again the brand is still in its early relatively early stages of development in that market we have good awareness but lots of opportunity to improve lots of opportunities to optimize the store network. So I think we are as optimistic as we have ever been about the opportunities in Greater China.", "Mark Erceg", "Yes and in terms of your question about unit growth, jewelry unit volume growth in Asia-Pacific during the year part of it was just core better growth but a lot of it was due to fact that we opened the new stores. So that unit growth is not on comp store basis. Not a total region basis, total sales basis but nonetheless we were pleased with it and then in terms of Hong Kong as everyone knows Hong Kong really softened almost two and half years ago started in October 2014 but finally in 2016 we started to see some improvement. Still down but certainly getting less bad from quarter to quarter and what point it will completely bottom out and start growing is anybody's guess but we certainly think that's the worst part is probably behind us and we are getting closer to stabilization there. ", "Betty Chen", "Okay. My second question is if I could, in the last year I think you mentioned a lot of units under 500, I think maybe up 10% or so any sort of material increase in 2017 or 2018 that we should think about for that category especially since it\u2019s an important area for not only inflow but also online as well? Thanks.", "Michael Kowalski", "Well, we will be there in across all categories for 2017 and 2018. There will be newness in silver, gold, platinum, diamonds so we are not going to get too technical in terms of how we are dividing up our newness by category or by material but they will certainly be newness in silver just as there will be across every category.", "Betty Chen", "Great, thanks, best of luck.", "Michael Kowalski", "Thank you. Jenifer next question.", "Operator", "We will go next to Simeon Siegel with Nomura Global Research.", "Simeon Siegel", "Thanks good morning. Mark, it seems like the loan impairment this quarter went beyond the liquidity loan if that's right is there anything we should think about regarding further potential financing impairment and then just maybe taking a step back falling up on the supply chain commentary, maybe it's still early but as you have looked through the operations you have been referring to the aspects of the integration that you\u2019re pleased with anything you call out as parts of the process you might want to image the opportunity and changing? Thanks.", "Mark Erceg", "Two good questions. So with respect to the loans that we had previously made in order to be able to access supply the good news is that that has all largely packed at this point we have one loan as outstanding as a performing loan. After this quarter it may be couple of million dollars and as I said it's a performing loan that should be all that remains with us so what we think is we have a processed through all of that.", "With respect to your other question I don't want to evade because it's a fair question but I think for me there is just abundance of opportunities that is across. So a lot of work has been done a lot of really good work has been done but that said and despite the fact it's a 180 year old company there is still enormous opportunities going forward that we have the ability to access. So maybe one thing I would offer is the state of the IT systems because the company is rapid growth days there is an opportunities for now that we ability the ability to stitch that together in seamless way and that's going to give us a lot of additional capabilities going forward. So, maybe one thing is I would have thought that maybe there is little bit more of evolved IT infrastructure and related to the financial cue but there is only addressed and we are going to get after in short order and again I don't speak from an opportunities.", "Simeon Siegel", "Thanks, best luck for the year.", "Michael Kowalski", "Jenifer, next question.", "Operator", "We will go next to Janet Kloppenburg with JJK Research.", "Janet Kloppenburg", "Good morning everyone. Welcome back Mike. ", "Michael Kowalski", "Hey Janet, thank you.", "Janet Kloppenburg", "I wanted to just ask the question about the mix of the business, it sounds like the silver business is stabilizing and the fashion silver business is improving. And I am wondering if encourage Mike that that mix can contain to be favorable and that you are a turning point in the fashion silver business?", "And for Mark I was wondering how influential that would be to the gross margin as we look into fiscal 17 and whether or not you think, you will be able to generate the same level of gross margin improvement in 17 as was seen in 16. And just lastly Mike or Mark whoever on marketing the legendary marketing campaign launched in the fall. I was wondering if there is any way to discuss the effectiveness of that campaign and reaching the millennial customers how well was it resonated and if the program will move forward? Thank you.", "Michael Kowalski", "Let me try to answer the first question Janet around the overall going forward direction of product assortment, product categories as I think everyone on the call knows part of the magic of Tiffany over the very, very many years has been our ability to balance that those categories and to move forward with them all simultaneously critical to that has always been our ability to drive lower price point sales because of the very favorable margin profile that category. And once again as you have heard before we stabilized that segment.", "We also feel very good about fashion segment, gold fashion part of the segment. And once again to the entire mix that also has favorable gross margin profile. So I think we are not finished certainly but right now we are feeling relatively good about the direction of category evolution and of course as we have said now many times on the phone we have the work in progress on watches which we are pleased with and of course the upcoming gift collection which also should be additive incremental to gross margin.", "So on that score of product balance relative category growth going forward we are in a pretty good spot right now and what I would offer is at the end of the day when you ask questions about gross margin and things we are really focused on operating margin. We\u2019re trying to put together sustainable business model to get about this basis point in the operating line each and every year.", "Certainly within our product offerings certain groupings within that have higher gross margins than others. Silver fashion is an example that said we enjoy pretty attractive gross margins in the absolute across all of our product offerings. And I don't want us to become articulated on gross margin as it relates to product mix because at the end of the day I am happy to sell an incremental item across any of our offerings because in the absolute they are very accretive and attractive to us. So product mix does play into it but I don't want to overplay the role of that in our overall business model.", "Mark Erceg", "And certainly we continue to try to drive sales at jewelry because again [indiscernible] are not as robust as they are another parts of the product spectrum on the margin they are just wonderful. So we have no problem. We have no problem in joining the success in those sorts of sales. And finally Janet last question about the millennial and the advertising campaign I don't know that always a difficult on answer, difficult to know questions but as some quantitative evidence I would simply point out that again there is the fashion categories where we enjoy the most relative success so I think that be at least directionally of some success in appealing to millennial.", "Janet Kloppenburg", "Thanks so much and good luck.", "Michael Kowalski", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada. ", "Brian Tunick", "Thanks. Good morning. I guess for Mike, I was just curious about your new board members, your new investors what in your mind do you think the new board members bring to the table and maybe what could be the timing of their influence on strategy for the business? Thanks very much.", "Michael Kowalski", "Well certainly in terms of timing they are already at the table we had our first board meeting which was a very productive helpful meeting. Certainly the new directors collectively they bring a wealth of obviously a wealth of highly relevant experience and expertise whether it's consumer products luxury and life style products and obviously retailing. I don't think that as we said a couple of weeks ago we still, we feel very, very confident in the fundamental strategic direction of the company so I am not from my perspective not especially looking for a dramatic left or right turns in our strategies. I think they along with the entire board will help evolve our strategic direction and again we are confident that they will all contribute importantly to that.", "Okay Jenifer another question.", "Operator", "We will go next to Paul Lejuez with Citi.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hey guys good morning. It's Jen on for Paul. Two quick ones if I may. First wondering if you could talk a little bit about January comps improvements beyond the flagship what you saw kind of Americas and then Europe and Asia-Pacific where trends also improved versus holiday?", "And then secondly, I think you said that we will start to see some of the luxury accessories in November I was wondering if we started to see some of that already and will start to see like more in November or if we should \u2013 if we won't see anything until November and gross margins on that categories should we think of them as being higher than some of the other categories? Thanks.", "Mark Erceg", "Well to say, it will be November for the introduction of the full non-jewelry luxury gift collection. March is attractive and in terms of January trends we did say that things were slightly better in the U.S. part of that just coming from the big transaction in the New York flagship store and we did already mentioned that we had some shift from the earlier Chinese New Year that benefited some business in Asia and so but we are not going to get more specific than that. So January came in a little bit better than we had expected. And we planned accordingly for 2017.", "Paul Lejuez", "Alright. Great. Thank and best of luck guys.", "Michael Kowalski", "Jenifer next question. ", "Operator", "We will go next to Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. ", "Ike Boruchow", "Hi good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick follow up into Asia-Pacific and any guiding explicitly for the reason but just kind of curious embedded in your outlook are you assuming that the declines I Hong Kong continue to improve a little bit and then I am just curious about how you view the changes in travel in terms of Korea and China and how that's changing and how that might impact other business on the Mainland?", "Michael Kowalski", "Yes, we are assuming that at some point business in Hong Kong will stabilize without getting more specific than that but we said it 2016 we saw it sequential getting better and we hope them that we can continue to see that 2017 certainly would be very nice at some point to talk about it flattening out, but not yet. In terms of Chinese Tours Travel and Korea [indiscernible] we will see it's a little bit early to make a comment and implications of that but again we are pretty comfortable in dealing with the dynamics of tourist movement around the world so we will see how that develop. We certainly got strong physician in Korea strong store day.", "Ike Boruchow", " Got it, thank you.", "Michael Kowalski", "Maybe one or two questions and we will wrap it up. Jenifer?", "Operator", "We will go next Christian Buss with Credit Suisse Securities.", "Christian Buss", "Good morning. I am wondering if you could provide some perspective on your e-commerce business and how that's evolving on how that's trending in the percentage of sales and what combination if did she have for 2017 on that business?", "Michael Kowalski", "It's been 6% of worldwide sales for several years now. And I think it's important to put it in perspective relative to our global luxury peers 6% is probably about average for luxury peers and significantly larger than our luxury peers. Having said that we do believe that obviously we would like to restart growth but again I think the key is as I said before the key to that segment or to that distribution channel really is going to be about product innovation and development. So I think I will leave it at that. Yes.", "Christian Buss", "Thank you and best of luck.", "Michael Kowalski", "Thanks. Okay one more question.", "Operator", "We will go next to Randal Konik with Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Randal Konik", "Thank you for taking my call. So couple of questions I guess one on the product newness factor here it talks about increasing the pace of newness kind of any further color on how you are thinking about that either from a skew count perspective or an actual category perspective because when I look historic about over the last 17 years or at least over the last time. You guys are doing great job when you announced Tiffany keys collection, the key marketing around the celebration rings so when you basically come out with the new categories it does very well and I am just trying to get a sense of how you are thinking about launching new collections and versus launching just additional excuse within existing collection and then lastly around skew counts do you think about increasing gross skew counts but basically leading net skew counts flat to increase skew count productivity. I am just trying to get a sense of how you think this all plays out from the product newness perspective? Very much appreciated.", "Michael Kowalski", "Correct. Well, let me say the obvious maybe we are not about two profligate the skew count so probably more or less your suggestion that combined with the pace of new product and productions and increased pace of new product, new collections reductions, new skew count probably will stay where it is and it might even continue to decline a bit. But the key will be building, growth is going to come from a combination of one new collections and if you look at the evolution of our assortment of the past ten years far more concentrated today in important collections than it was ten years ago in multiple smaller collection. So we want new collections but they have to be big and they need to be impactful of course Tiffany would one of the models going forward for that. At the same time we need to be mindful that existing collections return to Tiffany and return to Tiffany Love they have to be renewed and we have to continue to animate and increase and inject energy into those. So it's going to be as it always is a very careful balance of making sure that we have significant new collections that marketing can drive at the same time making sure that core collections that are still the majority that will always be the majority of sale continue to grow at the same time. So it's a complex balancing act.", "Randal Konik", "And can I add some follow up if possible with Reed, I think that\u2019s a great hire what are your expectations of him or what has he seen when you review the business on how you can better tie product launches to the store look and importantly the marketing cadence or the marketing look out there with the product on people etcetera. So how to see, what is your vision for him or what's his vision for the brand and how to tie it all together since he is more his role is kind of the in-charge of your multiple areas not just product?", "Michael Kowalski", "Yes I think, I will at this point I will decline to speak for Reed, he hasn't been here that long although tremendous he has bent for my perspective tremendous progress but I think what you said if I can just repeat because I think it is critically important for everyone on the call and in addition to product design Reed will lead the brands artistic and design vision with respect to stores to e-commerce to marketing to advertising right now he is heavily engaged and looking it at there is new store prototypes. So I think we are going to look to Reed for obviously a comprehensive integrated brand vision what that brand vision is going to be other than it's not going to be radical left or right turn from where we are I think it's going to be a continued evolution fine tuning of what we have but I think probably would be premature for us to speak about that today.", "Mark Aaron", "Right. I think we are going to wrap it up. I hope this has been helpful to all of you and have a great day. Thank you all. Jenifer let\u2019s wrap it up.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your line.

Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today\u2019s call is Ralph Nicoletti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark Aaron", "Thank you. Hello everyone. Earlier today we reported Tiffany\u2019s third quarter results and I hope you\u2019ve had a chance to review the news release. On today\u2019s call, Ralph and I will comment on those results and on the full year outlook.", "Before continuing, please first note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany\u2019s Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.", "Now turning to results. As an overview, Tiffany\u2019s worldwide sales rose 5% in the quarter, with mixed performance by region due to a variety of factors that I\u2019ll address in a moment. There was a 2% negative translation effect from the strengthening U.S dollar. And sales on a constant exchange rate basis rose 7%. By product category, we saw the greatest strength in fashion jewelry sales.", "The operating margin was up from last year, resulting from a gross margin increase that more than offset higher SG&A growth. And that SG&A increase included the stepped up marketing spending that we had discussed on last quarter\u2019s call. During the quarter, we completed a long term bond issuance to prepay high rate existing debt, which reduced the future interest expense and extends long term debt maturities. We recorded a $94 million one-time charge for the debt extinguishment. Adding it all up, Tiffany\u2019s third quarter net earnings increased 5%, excluding the charge, but declined 60% with the charge.", "Let\u2019s now look at regional sales performance in the quarter. Starting with the Americas region, total sales increased 10% in the quarter due to an overall increase in the average price per jewelry unit sold, reflecting price increases taken in the Americas and other regions as well, but also stronger demand for gold within the fashion jewelry category. It\u2019s worth noting that there was healthy unit growth in most categories, but that was offset by continued unit declines in entry level price point silver jewelry. ", "We attribute the healthy sales growth from the Americas to a range of factors, including more engaging selling initiatives and visual merchandizing in our stores, new products, compelling marketing, and what has been a favorable macro environment for our core customers. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales rose 11% in the quarter and comparable store sales also increased 11%, following an 8% comp increase in the first half of this year, and compared with a 1% comp increase in the third quarter of last year.", "We experienced healthy rates of sales growth in most markets of the U.S. Sales growth in the New York flagship store benefited from increased local demand, while foreign tourist spending was about equal to last year. In terms of new stores, earlier this month we opened a 2,000 square foot store on Boston\u2019s fashionable Newbury Street and expect to soon open a 5,000 square foot store in the exciting Miami Design District. Elsewhere in the Americas region, we were pleased to see solid, double digit local currency sales growth in Canada, Mexico and Brazil in the quarter. ", "The Asia pacific region had its challenges in the quarter, starting with the difficult comparison to a 22% comp store sales increase last year, which at that time had been driven by broad based growth across the region, including some statement jewelry sales. It was a different picture in this third quarter, with double digit comp store sales growth in mainland China, offset by varying degrees of softness in other markets. We\u2019d expected only modest comp growth in Asia Pacific in this third quarter.", "As we\u2019ve said before, Greater China now consisting of a total of 45 stores in mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao, represents more than half of our Asia Pacific sales. And our nine stores in Hong Kong contribute a meaningful part of those greater China sales. To no one\u2019s surprise, recent protests and demonstrations have led to a decline in visitors coming to Hong Kong, which we believe was the primary factor adversely affecting sales at several of our Hong Kong stores, including one at their airport. In total, Asia Pacific sales increased 2% due to growth in the engagement jewelry and wedding bands category and the fashion jewelry category.", "Looking at results on a constant exchange rate basis, total sales also rose 2% and comp store sales declined 3%, which as I said reflected mixed performance across most markets, but strong comp growth in mainland China. Regarding new store activity in this region, just a week ago we opened our seventh store in Australia in Adelaide and we anticipate opening our 27th store in China in January.", "Turning to Japan, total sales on a constant exchange rate basis declined 5% in the third quarter due to lower unit volume in all jewelry categories. And comp store sales declined 6% versus a 5% comp increase in last year\u2019s third quarter. However, the Yen averaged 106 to the dollar in the third quarter, versus 98 a year ago. So including that negative translation effect, sales in dollars declined 12%. The Yen has weakened further since the end of the quarter, being quoted at 118 to the dollar today.", "I presume by now you\u2019re all aware of the extreme volatility in consumer spending before and after an increase in Japan\u2019s consumption tax on April 1st. As a result, Tiffany\u2019s comp store sales on a constant exchange rate basis had increased 30% in the first quarter due to substantial pull forward of demand and then declined 13% in the second quarter. The return to monthly sales growth is taking longer than anticipated and we believe softness is now being exacerbated by weakening economic conditions. Despite the volatility, our sales in Japan and year to date have grown at a modest single digit rate in Yen as we typically expect over the longer term. We increased our store count by one in Japan during the quarter when we opened a highly visible, 3,000 square foot free standing store in the important Shinjuku area of Tokyo. ", "While we were pleased with an overall improvement in European sales performance, sales results by market were mixed. Total sales rose 9% in the third quarter due to sales growth in all jewelry categories, tied to both higher volume and average price. And that total sales growth came from higher spending by both local customers and foreign tourists. Looking at it on a constant exchange rate basis, total sales rose 10% and comp store sales rose 2%, which followed a 5% comp decline in the first half of the year and compared with a 2% comp increase in last year\u2019s third quarter. ", "We saw quite a contrast in European sales results between the UK and the continent. All countries in which we operate stores in continental Europe, achieved varying degrees of comp store sales growth in local currencies tied to both local customer and foreign tourist spending. However, comps continued to decline in the UK, reflecting some softness in both customer categories. In Paris, we continue to be very satisfied with the initial sales results and brand enhancing exposure from the major store we opened on the Champs Elysees earlier this year, which is serving both foreign visitors and local shoppers. Lastly, we had a solid quarter in our other segment, with 28% sales growth in the quarter. This performance was driven by strong 35% comp store sales growth and the sales in our first company operated store in Moscow, which opened earlier this year.", "With all the talk about tourism, it\u2019s important to think about it from a global perspective. Tiffany\u2019s expanding store base positions us nicely to benefit where the customers spend locally or when they travel. Therefore shifts in spending from one market to another, whether local or tourist related tied to currency shifts or other macro events, become less relevant as long as we are serving the customer somewhere. ", "Summarizing our worldwide store expansion plans, we are on track to have opened 10 stores by the end of this fiscal year and to have closed two older ones. In total, this represents net increases of 3%, both in company operated stores and in gross square footage. In addition to expanding our company operated store base, we continue to focus on renovating, and in a few cases, relocating existing stores to enhance the in-store experience for our customers and to optimize space utilization. So while we continue to expand our store base at a measured pace, it goes without saying that maximizing the quality of distribution is the highest priority. Beyond stores, I just want to reiterate that our websites around the world continue to serve two important functions, as sales vehicles, but equally important, for marketing communication that can drive brand and product awareness and store traffic.", "That concludes the regional sales review. In terms of merchandizing highlights, we saw strong growth in our fashion jewelry category and at relatively higher price points. In the fashion jewelry category, which primarily includes jewelry without gemstones, we\u2019re delighted with the initial response to our new Tiffany T collection, targeted to the style conscious female self-purchase customer with wide ranging and global appeal. Tiffany T is offered in a range of materials with the majority of designs in yellow, white or rose gold, with and without diamonds, as well as some pieces in sterling silver, making the collection available in a wide range of prices from a few hundred dollars up to about $20,000. For the T collection, as well as our successful Atlas collection launched over the past year, it\u2019s worth noting that gold jewelry is performing especially well.", "Sales in the engagement jewelry and wedding band category rose modestly in the quarter and our relatively new Harmony engagement collection is growing in popularity. Our expanded Keys collection is also performing well globally, with some expansion of styles and fashion in fine jewelry. Also worth noting is the continued success of our yellow diamond collection, Elsa Peretti\u2019s Diamonds by the Yard collection and our beautiful Victoria collection. ", "Ralph will now review the rest of the earning statement, the balance sheet and our full year expectations.", "Ralph Nicoletti", "Thank you, Mark for that sales review. Topline results were clearly mixed for a variety of reasons during the quarter, but we are executing our strategies well despite the volatile global environment. I think the key takeaways affecting third quarter results were sales growth benefited from strength in the Americas and improving trends in Europe, partially offset by softness in Asia Pacific and Japan.", "Healthy fashion jewelry sales growth was led by strength in gold jewelry and operating margin increase that was tied to continued solid gains in gross margin, despite a substantial year over year increase in marketing spending. And we are maintaining our most recent full year earnings outlook.", "As Mark provided an update on our sales performance, I will now review the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin was 59.5% in the third quarter, up from 57% last year due to favorable product and book costs and price increases taken across all product categories and regions as well as strong sales growth in fashion jewelry.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 10% in the third quarter, notably reflecting the substantial increase in marketing spending that we planned and had highlighted on our call three months ago. Much of that marketing increase was tied to the launch of the Tiffany T collection, which will continue to substantially lift marketing spending in the fourth quarter as well.", "Operating earnings increased 10% on the 5% sales growth and the operating margin increased 70 basis points in the quarter as the higher gross margin more than offset the higher SG&A spending. As previously disclosed, we took a one-time charge in the third quarter for a loss on debt extinguishment tied to prepaying during the quarter $400 million of long term debt that carried an average interest rate of 9.8%, with maturities between 2015 and 2019. The $94 million pretax charge equated to $61 million after tax or fully $0.07 per diluted share. We replaced it by issuing $550 million of long term debt during the quarter, with an average interest rate of 4.4% and maturities of 10 years for $250 million and 30 years for $300 million. This was an important step to lowering our ongoing interest cost and extend maturities.", "Interest and other expenses net in the third quarter was $15, versus $14 million last year. And the effective income tax rate of 35.5% in the quarter was 3.2 points above last year when we had benefited from a one-time favorable impact of tax regulations as well as differences in geographical mix of earnings. ", "In total, net earnings, excluding the debt extinguishment charge, rose 5% in the quarter to $99 million or $0.76 per share, although net earnings declined 60%, including the charge.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the quarter in a strong position, with substantial liquidity. Net inventories at October 31 were up 6% versus year ago to support new stores and product introductions. We now expect a high single digit increase in net inventories for this year. Our longer term objective continues to call for keeping inventory growth less than the rate of sales growth.", "Capital expenditures of $153 million in the year to date were similar to the $149 million at this time last year. For the full year, we are now forecasting CapEx at $250 million versus $220 million last year, with the increase tied to information technology with the development of a global customer relationship management system and more advanced order and inventory management capabilities.", "During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 63,000 shares at an average cost of $92 a share. This leaves $278 million available for future repurchases under our $300 million three-year program that expires in March of 2017. ", "Factoring in everything I\u2019ve mentioned in our overall liquidity position, at the end of the third quarter we had $383 million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments versus $521 million a year ago. The total of short term and long term debt as a percent of stockholders equity was 37% versus 36% a year ago.", "I want to wrap up the call with a brief comment on our full year outlook. We began 2014 projecting net earnings in the range of $4.05 to $4.15 per share or 9% to 11% higher than the adjusted $3.73 per share that was earned in 2013. We have raised the range twice after reporting first and second quarter results. And today, based on these third quarter results, we are affirming our most recent forecast at $4.20 to $4.30 per share, excluding the debt extinguishment charge, representing estimated full year EPS growth of 13% to 15%.", "Our full year forecast now calls for a mid to high single digit percentage increase in worldwide sales in dollars versus our previous high single digit forecast. We have been feeling some adverse effects from the stronger U.S dollar, which would have had a greater effect on the rate of sales growth in the fourth quarter and into next year if the current exchange rates hold where they are now. We continue to expect a healthy increase in the operating margin for the full year but coming entirely from the higher gross margin. ", "To conclude, Tiffany has performed well so far this year, although regional performance outside the Americas has been volatile. Most importantly, we\u2019ve successfully added stores in a number of key markets. We have expanded our assortment with the exciting Tiffany T collection, among others. We have evolved our marketing communications and we continue to enhance our in-store experience. Those initiatives position us well going forward. ", "We wish you happy holidays in the coming weeks and now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Mark.", "Mark Aaron", "Thanks Ralph. We hope you\u2019ve all found this third quarter review to be informative.

Today's call is being recorded. Participating on this call is Mr. Jim Fernandez, executive vice president and chief financial officer, and Mr. Mark Aaron, vice president of investor relations. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead sir.", "Mark Aaron", "Thank you. Hello and thank you to everyone for joining us. On today's call, Jim and I will provide you with a review and analysis of Tiffany's third quarter financial results and also comment on our outlook for the balance of the year.", "Before continuing, please note Tiffany's Safe Harbor provision that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's 2009 annual report on Form 10-K and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.", "Now we can proceed. We're pleased to deliver another quarter of strong financial performance. Worldwide sales growth of 14% was higher than we expected. Gross margin was also better than we expected, and SG&A expense growth was in line with our expectations, all of which contributed to a solid 27% increase in net earnings and a 43% increase in net earnings from continuing operations when excluding non-recurring items.", "Despite challenging conditions that continue in some markets, these results reflect the powerful benefits from having a globally diversified store base. In fact, the combined sales of the Asia-Pacific, Japan, and Europe regions actually exceeded our U.S. sales in the third quarter. ", "Let's now look at the details. In the Americas, sales increased 9% in the third quarter. The overall sales growth came from increased average price per unit sold, as strong unit growth in the engagement, fine, and designer jewelry categories was offset by unit declines in silver jewelry. Comparable store sales on a constant exchange rate basis rose 5% in the quarter, versus a 10% decline last year. The trend improved as the quarter progressed, with increases of 1% in August, 6% in September, and 10% in October. This compared with declines last year of 17%, 8%, and 4% in the respective three months.", "Please note that effective with our next report we will be discontinuing the disclosure of specific monthly comp store sales numbers for the Americas. Instead, in the future we will discuss intra-quarter changes and trends in a more general and directional sense as we do for our other geographic regions, which we think is more relevant.", "Continuing with the quarterly review, sales in the New York flagship store declined 3% in the quarter, but our annual Blue Book customer event in New York occurred last year in October and this year in November. The eight New York-area branch stores posted a 1% comp increase. Comparable sales for branch stores in the Americas rose 8% in the quarter on top of a 10% decline last year.", "Looking around the Americas, it was generally consistent single-digit comp growth in most regions, with the exception of greater strength in the Pacific Northwest as well as in Hawaii and Guam. Sales to local market customers increased in the quarter, but a larger portion of the sales growth in the Americas continued to come from higher sales made to foreign visitors. The sales results in the New York flagship store reflected no significant changes in sales to either local customers or tourists.", "In terms of price stratification, we continued to see bifurcated performance, with declines in sales and transactions below $500, but double-digit percentage increases in most every other higher price category, indicating to us the diverging effects to one degree or another that the economy is having on consumer spending.", "During the third quarter we opened new stores in Baltimore, Maryland, in the Towson Center, and in Santa Monica, California, in Santa Monica Place, and are very pleased with initial results. And just earlier this month, we opened our jewel salon in the New York flagship store where we invite our highest spending clients from throughout the world to see our statement jewelry collection in a luxurious new environment.", "Complementing our stores in the Americas are Internet and catalog sales, which increased 7% in the quarter due to an increased average order size. This compared with an 8% decline last year. And lastly, the Americas region includes Canada, Mexico, and Brazil, and we are pleased to say that local currency comps in the quarter rose nicely in all three countries. We definitely see the potential for additional stores in those countries.", "Let's now turn to the Asia-Pacific region, where a 24% sales increase was generated by higher spending per transaction tied to unit volume growth, especially in the fine and engagement jewelry categories. On a constant exchange rate basis, sales rose 20% and comparable store sales rose 11% on top of a 9% increase last year. The trend during the quarter showed the largest increase in October.", "The greater China market now represents more than half of our Asia-Pacific sales and it posted the highest total sales growth in the region, while most other countries were up to lesser degrees, and Australia continued to be relatively soft. ", "We held a glamorous event in Beijing in October within the Forbidden City, attended by over 400 customers and members from the press. We were extremely pleased with the favorable reactions and extensive media coverage, which had served to heighten awareness of our brand and support Tiffany's growing position as a diamond authority throughout China as we move to double our store base there in the next few years.", "Also during the quarter we opened our sixth store in Taiwan and we were pleased to launch informational websites last month in Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, which we know from historical experience should benefit our stores from the increased brand and product exposure that the websites provide.", "Turning to our business in Japan, total sales rose 12% in the quarter, as an increased average price per unit sold more than offset lower units. However, the sales growth was magnified by the yen being about 10% stronger than the U.S. dollar versus last year. Measured in local currency, total sales in Japan rose 2%, but comparable retail store sales declined 2%, which was on top of a 13% decline last year. The monthly trend improved during the quarter and the comp in October was actually positive, although it's certainly too early to draw any conclusions from that.", "Now let's look at our continued strength in Europe, where a robust 22% sales growth was due to increases in jewelry unit sales and in the average price per unit sold, in the quarter 9% and 4% weaker than last year. Therefore, total European sales, excluding translation, rose 29% and comparable store sales increased 24% on top of a 9% increase in last year's third quarter. Comps rose by at least 20% in all three months, and there was no meaningful difference in the strong performance between sales in the U.K. and most continental European countries.", "A large majority of our sales in Europe are to local customers, but we are seeing increasing sales to foreign visitors as well. In addition, this past June we introduced ecommerce in continental Europe and it is generating sales above our expectations and probably also stimulating customer visits to our stores.", "Rounding out our segments, our other sales, which rose 26% in the third quarter, primarily due to increased wholesale sales of Tiffany products to third party distributors in emerging markets such as Russia and the Middle East. ", "Looking at a few merchandising highlights in the quarter, sales of engagement jewelry were strong in the Americas, Asia-Pacific, and Europe. Statement jewelry and the fine jewelry category, including the Tiffany Garden and Metro collections, celebration rings, and many others, performed very well, reflecting the overall strength of higher-end transactions in platinum, diamonds, and gold.", "Conversely, worldwide silver jewelry sales rose only modestly, although pretty strongly, in Europe and Asia. And the Keys collection continues to perform well, especially in platinum and gold, despite tough year-over-year comparisons. The designs of Elsa Peretti and Paloma Picasso posted healthy sales increases, led by Elsa's always-popular Diamonds By the Yard and Paloma's distinctive new Marrakesh collection. ", "We are delighted with initial customer response to our new collection of extraordinary yellow diamonds. Tiffany brand watch sales continued to post strong growth in our stores. In fact, you can see one of the beautiful new watch designs today in our ad on page three of both the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. And lastly, we are very pleased with initial sales of our new leather accessories collection. So you can see that sales growth in the quarter spanned the majority of product categories.", "Turning to the rest of the earnings statement, gross margin in the quarter rose 3.7 points to 58.5%, which was higher than we expected. An important contributor to the higher margin was the price increase that we took earlier in the year to offset higher product costs over the past two years. In addition, there were also meaningful manufacturing efficiencies and sales leverage on the fixed costs that are in cost of sales. ", "Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 15% in the third quarter, which were close to our expectations. We had said at the start of the year that SG&A would increase all year due to higher staffing and occupancy costs tied to store growth and that marketing costs would rise sharply all year in absolute terms and as a percentage of sales to reverse a steep reduction last year. In addition, we said that the increase in marketing spending would be even greater in the third quarter to support the major event we held last month in Beijing.", "SG&A in the third quarter also included about $6 million of non-recurring costs tied to the pending relocation of our New York headquarters staff. Last year, SG&A expenses included a $4 million charge related to terminating a management agreement after we bought out some minority interests in connection with our diamond sourcing and polishing operations in South Africa and Botswana. You can refer to the non-GAAP measure schedule in today's news release. Excluding those one-time items, the SG&A increase over last year was also 15% and the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales was 43.3% in the quarter versus 43% last year.", "Other expenses net, which is largely interest expense, was $13 million in the quarter, versus $11.3 million last year. The effective tax rate was 34.9%, in line with our expectations, compared with 22% last year when there were favorable tax reserve adjustments tied to the expiration of certain statutory periods. ", "Adding it all up, net earnings from continuing operations rose 27% in the third quarter to $55.1 million and EPS rose 26% to $0.43 per diluted share. And excluding the various non-recurring items, net earnings from continuing operations increased 43% in the third quarter and have increased 63% in the year-to-date.", "I'll now turn the call over to Jim.", "Jim Fernandez", "Thanks Mark. We are obviously very satisfied with Tiffany's overall financial performance in the third quarter, with better than expected sales and earnings growth. New stores and new products are being well received and our infrastructure is performing efficiently to ensure product supply availability and timely distribution. So we believe we are well-positioned for a successful finish to 2010 and of course the sustained solid performance over the longer term. ", "We certainly have the financial strength to achieve our objectives. Our balance sheet at October 31 had $530 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments versus $375 million a year ago. Total short-term and long-term debt at October 31 stood at $755 million versus $753 million a year ago and stockholders' equity was about $2 billion. At October 31, Tiffany's return on average assets was 10%, and return on average stockholders' equity was 18%, both of which achieve our objectives. ", "Looking at a few other items on the balance sheet, accounts receivable at October 31 were up 19% from a year ago, largely due to sales growth and receivables are turning at a high 17 times per year. Net inventories at October 31 were up 7% from a year ago, primarily due to the addition of new stores and new products. In addition, about a third of the year-over-year increase resulted from translating foreign inventories into U.S. dollars. Inventory availability in our stores is high, and we expect a low double-digit percentage increase for the full year.", "I want to add that our internal manufacturing facilities, complemented by outside suppliers, are performing very well to ensure that we have strong product supply. Last year we internally produced 60% of merchandise sold, and that number will move higher in the coming years. In fact, we recently finalized plans to expand our U.S. jewelry manufacturing capacity, and we broke ground for a 25,000 square foot facility in Lexington, Kentucky. Earlier this year, we began some production at a temporary facility in Lexington, and look forward to opening this new facility next spring, which will ultimately employ approximately 125 skilled workers.", "Capital expenditures were $89 million in the year-to-date, versus $47 million last year when we restricted spending wherever we could, and we are now forecasting full-year cap ex of approximately $150 million, which is down from our previous forecast of $180 million, which results from some projects being carried over into 2011. You should still assume that cap ex in future years will represent approximately 6-7% of sales, with 2011 cap ex probably at the upper end of that range.", "We've been repurchasing stock this year on a regular and also opportunistic basis. In the third quarter we spent $26 million to buy back approximately 588,000 shares at an average cost of $43.68 per share. In the year-to-date, we've spent $73 million to repurchase approximately 1.7 million shares at an average cost of $42.68. While we have $329 million of remaining purchase authority under our currently authorized program, which will expire in January, we do not expect to spend that full amount in the next two months.", "We previously indicated our intentions to refinance a portion of the current maturity debt that was on our balance sheet at July 31. In September, we paid off 15 billion yen, or approximately $179 million of maturing debt and entered into 10 billion yen, or $118 million of new six-year debt in Japan at an attractive rate of 1.72%. At October 31, we had about $100 million of current maturity long-term debt, which we intend to pay off as it comes due over the next year.", "While we reduced our cash balances for debt reduction and share repurchases, I want to reiterate that we intend to maintain what we consider higher than normal liquidity in light of lingering economic uncertainties. Mark mentioned some of the new stores that we opened in the third quarter. There are additional exciting store openings in this fourth quarter. ", "In the U.S., we will be opening stores in the next few weeks in Jacksonville, a second Houston area store in the Woodlands, and another store in Los Angeles in the Beverly Center. In Asia-Pacific this month we've opened a store in Kunming, China, another store in Seoul, Korea, and will soon open a major store in China World, Beijing that will mark our 14th store in China.", "In Europe, two weeks ago we opened our ninth location in London, a 260-square meter store in Canary Wharf, and next week we will add our second store in Spain when we open a 360-square meter location on Paseo de Gracia in Barcelona. Worldwide, this will bring us to 14 stores added in 2010 and one closed in Japan, representing a net 6% increase in the number of company operated stores. We have not finalized our store opening plans for next year, but I will share with you that we are looking at quite a number of attractive markets, and will accelerate the rate of store openings in 2011.", "We indicated in today's news release that the fourth quarter has started very nicely, with sales growth exceeding our expectations. Even though the vast majority of the holiday season is certainly still ahead of us, we're pleased with the strong start. ", "In terms of our financial outlook for the full year, we are now projecting worldwide sales growing 12% to just over $3 billion. This implies a high single-digit percentage worldwide sales increase in the fourth quarter, with sales by region in the quarter in dollars expected to be up by a high single-digit percentage in the Americas, a slight increase in Japan, a low teens percentage in Asia-Pacific, and a mid-teens percentage in Europe. We expect a slight decline in other sales for the year.", "We've raised our gross margin expectation based on recent margin dynamics, and now look for about a 2 point increase in gross margin in the fourth quarter. For the full year, this implies more than a 2 point increase versus the previous expectation of 1.5 points. ", "Related to that, since increasing our retail prices earlier this year, precious metal and diamond costs have moved higher. We use substantial quantities of platinum and silver, and their costs have increased substantially year-to-date. Gold has also increased, but our usage is much smaller than platinum and silver, and costs for Tiffany quality diamonds are also up. Of course, keep in mind that labor can be a meaningful portion of product cost, and labor costs have increased only modestly. ", "Our strategy has always called for increasing retail prices when necessary and appropriate to offset higher product costs, and we would expect to take such action probably early next year. But as long as we assume that every jeweler also passes through their cost increases, Tiffany will maintain its strong competitive position.", "Looking at the rest of our forecast, we continue to manage our SG&A expenses very effectively, and we expect SG&A expenses, excluding non-recurring items, to increase 10-11% for the year, which implies a high single-digit percentage increase in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect other expenses net of about $50 million for the full year and we expect an effective income tax rate of approximately 34% for the year. ", "In total, based on our higher than expected third quarter earnings, and our increased assumptions for gross margin, we're now projecting net earnings from continuing operations in a range of $2.72 to $2.77 per diluted share. Consistent with previous forecasts, this does not include net expenses related to the pending location of our New York headquarters staff and a net tax benefit recorded in the first quarter, which in total is estimated at $0.06 per diluted share. And it compares very favorably with our initial 2010 expectation of $2.45 to $2.50 per diluted share.", "I'll close my remarks by reiterating that Tiffany's experienced organization, financial, and brand strength position us very well to continue to reward our stockholders. Please feel free to call Mark with any questions or comments about these results. Please also note on your calendars that we plan to publically report Tiffany's sales results for the November-December holiday period on January 11, 2011. However, we will continue our practice to not hold a conference call for that interim period. ", "That concludes this call. Thank you for joining us today and we hope that you enjoy the upcoming holidays.", "Operator", "For a replay of this call, you may dial toll-free at 888-203-1112, or our toll number is 719-457-0820.

F2Q06 (Qtr End 7/31/06) Earnings Call Transcript (TIF)", "url": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/16215-tiffany-and-co-f2q06-qtr-end-7-31-06-earnings-call-transcript-tif?part=single", "date": "2006-08-31 00:00:00", "company": "TIF", "executives": "Parsing error", "analysts": "Parsing error", "body": ["Tiffany & Co. (NYSE:TIF)  F2Q06 Earnings Call  August 31, 2006 8:30 am ET Executives March  1, 0000 ET", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Tiffany & Company second quarter earnings release conference call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. Participating on today\u2019s call is the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mark Aaron, and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Jim Fernandez.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark Aaron", "Thank you. Good morning, and thanks for joining us on this conference call. We reported Tiffany\u2019s second quarter results earlier today and hopefully you have had a chance to review the press release.", "Before continuing, please note Tiffany\u2019s Safe Harbor provision that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany\u2019s 2005 report on Form 10-K and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Now we can proceed.", "In the second quarter, Tiffany\u2019s net sales increased 9% and we achieved solid sales growth in a number of markets. As we expected, a lower gross margin and higher expense ratio affected results. However, we said on our first quarter conference call that we expected virtually no pre-tax earnings growth in the second quarter and the results we issued today met that expectation.", "Also in the past few months, we opened stores in exciting U.S. and international markets, we announced plans for some others, and we introduced a number of new products. The Board of Directors increased the dividend  for the fourth consecutive year, and we again repurchased a considerable amount of stock.", "Let\u2019s first look at our sales performance by channel of distribution in the second quarter.", "U.S. retail sales rose 8% in the quarter, primarily due to 5% comparable store sales growth, as well as results from several new stores. The 5% comp store sales growth was on top of a 6% increase in last year\u2019s second quarter. In terms of the monthly trend during the quarter, comps rose 6% in May, increased 8% in June, and declined 1% in July. In last year\u2019s second quarter, comps had increased 7% in May, 6% in June, and 4% in July.", "We are not going to read too much into the volatility of the monthly numbers and will not speculate on what future sales conditions it may portend. In fact, U.S. comps have rebounded in the month of August to date, with a mid-single-digit increase.", "After reporting disappointing results in the first quarter, sales in our flagship New York store rebounded in the second quarter with a 5% increase, which was on top of a 3% increase a year ago. We are looking forward to completing the renovation of the flagship store\u2019s main floor, which has likely been somewhat disruptive to sales in the past six months, but which should be wrapped up next week.", "Comps in our seven New York suburban stores also rose 5% in the quarter. Sales results in our U.S. branch stores improved in the quarter with a 4% comp increase, which was on top of a 6% increase a year ago.", "Looking around the country, several regions with above average growth included our eight stores in Florida, our four stores in Texas and one in Denver, as well as the Northwest region, which includes our two stores in Washington, one in Portland and five stores in northern California.", "However, the six stores in our Pacific region, that includes Hawaii and Guam, were again soft, primarily due to a decline in sales to Japanese tourists.", "In terms of some sales dynamics, the 5% comp in the quarter was generated by an increase in the average spending per transaction, while store traffic and transactions were virtually equal to the prior year.", "In terms of price stratification, there was sales growth in every price strata that we measure. However, there was smaller percentage growth in sales under $500, but meaningfully higher growth in sales and transactions over $10,000, $20,000, and $50,000, which of course are at a lower gross margin.", "In terms of customer mix, the overall U.S. comp store sales growth in the quarter was due to higher sales to local market customers, which also accounted for the majority of the New York flagship store\u2019s increase.", "Our expectation calls for a mid-single-digit increase in comparable U.S. store sales for the full year. Last year, U.S. comps rose 7% in the third quarter, 5% in the fourth quarter, and 7% for the full year.", "Consistent with our growth strategy, our U.S. plans include opening five new stores in 2006. We are getting strong results from our new store in Indianapolis that we opened in the second quarter. Also during the quarter, we expanded Tiffany\u2019s presence in South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, California, when we added an 800 square foot diamond salon in our store there. South Coast Plaza is our highest volume U.S. branch store and the salon showcases Tiffany\u2019s extraordinary diamond assortment and enables us to better serve the large and growing customer base.", "Earlier this month, we had a terrific opening in Nashville when customers welcomed our new store there. We also enjoyed a strong opening in our new store on the pier in Atlantic City, a new luxury retail project, and we are on track to open stores on the big island of Hawaii and in Tucson later this year.", "While U.S. comps rose 5% in the quarter, total U.S. retail sales rose 8%, indicating that new Tiffany & Co. stores continue to generate considerable sales and enthusiastic customer reaction.", "Staying in the U.S. for a moment, our direct marketing sales also rebounded strongly in the second quarter, posting an 18% increase. This was on top of a 5% increase last year and was better than our expectation.", "We said on the first quarter call that direct marketing sales at the end of April were soft because Mother\u2019s Day occurred a week later than last year, which caused a shift in ordering and sales to early in the second quarter. These results are indicative of that shift.", "The strong direct marketing sales growth was generated by increases in both the number of orders and in the average amount spent per order. We are very pleased with the pace of e-commerce growth, as well as the customer\u2019s favorable reaction to the product news we began selectively e-mailing to customers earlier this year. As we have said previously, we are reducing catalogue circulation by 10% to 15% this year due to the synergies between our website and catalogue.", "Let\u2019s now turn to international retail sales, which increased 10% in dollars in the second quarter.", "On a constant exchange rate basis, which excludes the translation effect from foreign currency changes, international sales rose 12%, indicating the foreign currencies were generally weaker than the U.S. dollar versus a year ago. For example, in the second quarter, the Yen averaged 114 to the dollar versus 109 a year ago. My following comments by region will reference sales on that constant exchange rate basis.", "International comparable store sales increased 10% in the second quarter, which was on top of the 3% increase a year ago. Japan now represents approximately half of Tiffany\u2019s international sales. Total retail sales in Japan increased 6% in the quarter, due to an increase in average jewelry price and mix. Comparable store sales from Japan rose 2% in the quarter, which was below our expectation and compared with a 1% increase a year ago.", "In terms of the monthly results during the quarter, comps increased 4% in May, on top of a 5% decline in May last year, rose 6% in June on top of a 2% increase, and declined 4% in July, compared with a 5% increase in July 2005. As noted in today\u2019s press release, comps in August to date have posted a high single-digit decline.", "Geographically, the 2% comp increase in the second quarter was comprised of similar increases in Tokyo and outside Tokyo. The Ginza flagship store, rose 1%.", "We opened two boutiques in Japan in the first quarter, in Mito and Yonago, and closed one in Tottori in the second quarter. We also recently announced plans to open a freestanding store in November in the important Roppongi Hills section of Tokyo, which is a key centre of luxury retail activity.", "We are continuing to pursue attractive opportunities to expand and enhance Tiffany\u2019s distribution base in Japan. Two current examples:", "Let\u2019s now look at the other half of the international retail channel, which is generating strong growth in sales and profitability. Comparable store sales in the Asia-Pacific region outside Japan increased 27% in the second quarter, which was on top of the 6% increase in the second quarter last year, and was considerably above our expectation. We experienced exceptional growth in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and Australia. We are also seeing strong growth in China in percentage terms, but it is still on a very small base.", "We opened a second store in Beijing during the quarter, and later this year will further expand Tiffany\u2019s presence in China with a second store in Shanghai and one in Macau. In addition, last week we opened a store in Busan, Korea to replace an older one that closed earlier this year.", "In Europe, comparable store sales rose 17% in the second quarter, which was on top of a 5% increase last year and was also above our expectations. We achieved strong sales growth in every European market. Sales in London rose nicely in the quarter, although sales were lower in the flagship store on Old Bond Street due to the disruption from the major renovation. However, we completed that renovation in mid-July and since then have seen a pronounced sales pick-up at that location. With almost 50% more gross square footage, the newly renovated store provides a more spacious and luxurious environment for our customers, and we are delighted with the results. We will further expand Tiffany\u2019s European presence in September when we open a store in Vienna.", "Finally, turning to the other Americas, we achieved solid sales increases in our stores in Toronto, Mexico, and Brazil during the quarter. Our new store in Monterey has had a strong start and we are very excited about our plan to open a store in Vancouver this November.", "Looking at international sales for the rest of the year, we are looking for a  low single-digit increase in Japan comparable store sales for the full year, and for translation purposes are planning the Yen at 115 to the dollar. We are looking for healthy low double-digit comp store sales growth in the various other international markets outside Japan, but are not planning them at the robust rate seen in the first-half of the year.", "Finishing the top-line review, sales in our other channel rose 4% in the second quarter. Sales at Little Switzerland stores increased 10%. In addition, we are continuing with our development of Iridesse stores, where we are adding seven stores this year.", "There was actually a slight decline in wholesale diamond sales in the quarter, but we still expect the pace of such sales to accelerate in the remainder of the year based on increased rough diamond purchasing.", "That covers sales by channel of distribution.", "Looking at a few merchandising highlights in the second quarter, growth was seen across a range of product categories, with diamond jewelry maintaining a prominent role in the sales growth, from high-end diamond jewelry to diamond engagement rings, to new diamond and platinum pendants. We are also pleased with continued favorable response to some of Tiffany\u2019s other relatively new fine jewelry collections, such as the Swing and Legacy collections.", "Our celebration rings initiatives continue to be very successful and has become an important base of our business.", "There was also growth in silver and gold jewelry, highlighted by the popular 1837 and Atlas collections.", "Sales also rose in the designer jewelry category, including Elsa Peretti and Paloma Picasso.", "We are pleased to report that the sales performance of Frank Gehry\u2019s jewelry designs, even though only introduced into one-third of our stores at the end of the second quarter, is far exceeding our expectations, and we will complete the store rollout in the third quarter.", "Lastly, the timepiece and tableware categories posted modest sales growth in the quarter.", "I am now pleased to turn the call over to Jim.", "Jim Fernandez ", "Thanks, Mark. Now let\u2019s look at the rest of the income statement. Gross margin of 55.1% in the second quarter was four-tenths of a point below a year ago, which was close to our expectation. The decline largely reflected higher product costs. We recorded a LIFO charge of $8.1 million in the quarter, compared with a charge of $3 million in last year\u2019s second quarter.", "We\u2019d been affected by higher costs for precious metals, but as appropriate, are addressing cost pressures through retail price adjustments. Higher costs are affecting the entire industry, and while it is difficult to quantify any customer resistance to higher prices, we believe that Tiffany is maintaining its competitive position and value propositions.", "We continue to expect that gross margin for the full year will be approximately equal to the prior year, based on our assumption for sales mix, product costs, and anticipated wholesale diamond sales.", "SG&A expenses increased 12% in the second quarter, which was in line with our expectation. The year-over-year rate of growth accelerated in the second quarter, largely due to higher store-related costs. SG&A in the first-half has also included increased marketing related event spending tied to the launch of the Frank Gehry jewelry collection.", "As expected, the expense ratio of 42.5% in the quarter was higher than the prior year because of insufficient sales leverage on these and other SG&A costs.", "We continue to expect a high single-digit percentage increase in SG&A for the full year which, based on our assumption for sales growth, would still result in some improvement in the expense ratio for the full year.", "Other expenses net of $5.3 million in the second quarter were in line with our expectation, and we expect it to be approximately $20 million for the full year.", "Therefore, earnings before income taxes declined 4% in the second quarter and our expectation called for it to be approximately equal to the prior year.", "The effective tax rate of 38.9% in the quarter was higher than the 28% rate in last year\u2019s second quarter. You will recall that Tiffany had a tax benefit of $6.6 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2005 related to the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. We continue to expect an effective tax rate of approximately 38% for the full year.", "Adding it all up, Tiffany generated net earnings of $41.1 million, or $0.29 per diluted share in the second quarter versus $50.6 million or $0.35 per diluted share a year ago.", "From a return perspective, at the end of the second quarter we were achieving a 9% return on average assets and a 14% return on average stockholder\u2019s equity, which in both cases are close to our expectations. We remain committed to achieving appropriate and sustainable investment returns. Our long-term objectives continue to call for a 10% return on average assets and a 15% return on average stockholder\u2019s equity.", "Tiffany\u2019s balance sheet remains strong. At July 31st, net receivables were up 14% from a year ago, largely due to sales growth, and are turning at 19 times per year. Net inventories at July 31st were up 16% from a year ago. An increase in finished goods was partly to support sales growth, as well as for new stores and new products. There were also increases in raw material and work in process inventories due to higher diamond purchasing and the effect of higher metal prices.", "In total, our expectation continues to call for a mid- to high-single-digit percentage increase in inventories for the full year, and some improvement in inventory turnover.", "Tiffany was again very active in its share repurchase program in the second quarter, spending almost $84 million to buy 2.5 million shares at an average cost of $33.20 per share. In the first half of 2006, we spent almost $164 million on share repurchases. That alone would have left us with $113 million authorized for repurchases under a $400 million program expiring in March of 2007. However, as announced today in a separate press release, Tiffany\u2019s Board of Directors has extended the program to December of 2009 and added $700 million to the authorization. That means we can spend up to $813 million in the next two-and-a-half years to repurchase stock which, at roughly current stock prices, would represent 15% to 20% of shares outstanding and market cap.", "We finished the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $147 million versus $129 million a year ago. Tiffany\u2019s debt leverage remained reasonable at the end of the quarter, with total debt to stockholder\u2019s equity at 33% versus 24% a year ago.", "We are optimistic about Tiffany\u2019s prospects for 2006 and beyond. We certainly acknowledge that there are various economic uncertainties and geopolitical anxieties. However, we remain convinced that there are increasing numbers of discerning consumers seeking the extraordinary products that we offer.", "In existing markets, we communicate to customers with effective marketing and public relations initiatives. We also have the opportunity to expand Tiffany\u2019s market penetration by entering many new markets. This year, we are increasing Tiffany\u2019s worldwide square footage by approximately 7%, which is slightly above our mid-single-digit growth strategy.", "We will maintain our active product development program by introducing many new jewelry designs in a wide range of prices.", "I am pleased to say that Tiffany\u2019s infrastructure is performing very well in support of our growth initiatives. Our internal manufacturing facilities are operating effectively, and our distribution centers are performing efficiently, handling store inventory replenishment and shipping Internet and catalogue orders to customers in a very timely fashion.", "We have substantial long-term opportunity to benefit from leveraging this highly developed infrastructure.", "Tiffany operates in a large and competitively fragmented industry, and we believe that our multi-channel communications and distribution represent a powerful model for long-term growth.", "In today\u2019s press release, we noted that our expectation for this third quarter includes a mid-single-digit increase in earnings before income taxes and net earnings approximately equal to last year\u2019s $0.16 per diluted share, which had benefited from a lower effective tax rate due to favorable reserve adjustments related to the expiration of certain statutory periods.", "Our full-year expectation for 2006 calls for low double-digit growth in earnings before income taxes, and net earnings of $1.77 to $1.82 per diluted share. Beyond 2006, our objective calls for at least 12% growth in earnings per share.", "We appreciate your interest in Tiffany. Please note on your calendars that we plan to report third quarter results on November 29th. That concludes this conference call, but as always, please feel free to call Mark with your questions or comments, and thanks for listening.", "Operator", "Thank you, gentlemen.

(NYSE:TIF)  F3Q06 Earnings Call  November 29, 2006 8:30 am ET Executives March  1, 0000 ET", "Operator", "Good day, everyone and welcome to this Tiffany & Co. third quarter earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today's call is the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mark Aaron and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Jim Fernandez. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark Aaron", "Thank you. Good morning and thanks for joining us today. On this conference call, Jim and I will review Tiffany's third quarter performance and comment on the near-term outlook. Please first note the following Safe Harbor statement for Tiffany.", "Statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's 2005 report on Form 10-K and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Now we can proceed.", "The results we reported this morning included solid comparable store sales growth in the U.S. and in many international markets. Our gross margin declined modestly. The SG&A expense ratio improved. We recorded gains in the quarter associated with the sales of equity investments. Our effective tax rate rose modestly from last year. So all in all, we reported 23% net earnings growth.", "Let's first look at Tiffany's sales performance in the four channels of distribution. Total U.S. retail sales rose 9% in the third quarter. On a total U.S. store basis, this was due to an increase in price and mix as well as some increase in unit volume. Comparable store sales growth of 6% in the quarter was pretty much in line with our recent expectations and was on top of a 7% comp increase in last year's third quarter. While we saw an increased number of transactions on a total U.S. store basis, as well as higher spending per transaction, comparable store sales growth was driven entirely by higher spending per transaction.", "Sales rose nicely throughout the quarter with comps increasing 6% in August, 7% in September, and 4% in October. For comparison, you should note that U.S. comps in last year 's third quarter had increased 5% in August and 8% in both September and October. From a geographical perspective, sales in the New York flagship store rose 13% on top of a 12% increase a year ago. We were pleased to finally complete the multi-year renovation of our New York flagship store during the quarter, and the reaction of our customers has been quite favorable.", "In addition, comps in the seven New York area branch stores rose 6%. Branch store comps around the U.S. rose 4% and there was no particular geographical concentration of strength. For example, a few stores with the largest percentage increases were in Seattle, Palm Desert, Houston, Coral Gables and Charlotte with varying degrees of change in other markets. However, the softest region was in the Pacific, where we continue to experience sales declines in Hawaii and Guam.", "Our price stratification analysis for the U.S. indicated that the greatest growth occurred in sales and transactions over $20,000 and over $50,000 which as many of you know, occur at lower gross margins.", "In terms of customer mix, the majority of the comp store sales growth came from higher sales to local market customers, which was also true for the New York flagship store.", "Lastly, we are experiencing robust performance in the new U.S. stores we've opened in 2006 in Indianapolis, Nashville, Atlantic City and Tucson. We will wrap up our U.S. store expansion for the year when we open a beautiful store on the big island of Hawaii tomorrow.", "Also in the U.S, sales in the direct marketing channel rose 11% in the third quarter which was slightly above our expectations and was on top of a 4% increase last year. Growth was generated by increased numbers of orders and increases in the amount spent per order. As planned, we reduced catalogue circulation in the quarter in line with our full year objective to reduce mailings by 10% to 15%. On the other hand, we began e-mail marketing earlier this year to the large customer database we have accumulated in recent years and these communications serve as timely reminders of upcoming holidays while providing appropriate gift suggestions.", "Let's now look at international retail sales which rose 9% in the third quarter but included some very divergent results. The 9% growth was on top of a 7% increase last year and was pretty much in line with our expectations. There was minimal currency translation effect in the quarter, and on a constant exchange rate basis which excludes the effect of translating local currency results into U.S. dollars, international retail sales also increased 9% in the quarter while comparable international store sales rose 4%.", "My following comments will refer to sales on a constant exchange rate basis. The international retail channel is composed of several distinct regions with approximately half of the channel sales in Japan while the other half includes the rest of Asia Pacific, Europe, Canada and Latin America.", "Total retail sales in Japan in the third quarter declined 3% as a decline in unit volume was only partly offset by an increase in average price and mix. Comp store sales in Japan declined 5%, which was below our expectation for a smaller decline and compared with a flat comp in last year's third quarter. The yen averaged 117 to the U.S. dollar in the third quarter versus 112 a year ago; therefore, the 3% decline in total Japan retail sales in yen translated into an 8% decline in U.S. dollars. Results in Japan were consistently soft throughout the quarter with comp declines of 5% in August, 4% in September and 7% in October. In comparison, comps in last year's third quarter had declined 2% in August and 1% in September, but had increased 4% in October. In the quarter, the 5% comp store sales decline was divided pretty evenly between the Tokyo market, including a 4% decline in our Tokyo flagship store, and locations outside Tokyo.", "Recent economic reports confirm that the Japanese economy is growing, although it appears that the environment for consumer spending is challenging. However, we believe that Tiffany has the potential to improve its performance there as we continue to focus on a more proactive customer engaging sales approach, as well as upgrading a number of our retail locations in Japan through renovations, expansions and/or relocations. This year we've opened four locations and closed one in Japan, including the highly visible opening earlier this month of our freestanding store in the Roppongi Hills section of Tokyo.", "Sales growth was notably better in the other half of international sales, continuing the strong trends from the first half of the year. In the Asia Pacific region outside Japan, a 17% increase in comparable store sales in the third quarter was above our expectations and was on top of a 4% increase last year with notable strength in Hong Kong and Australia. We're also pleased with Tiffany's growing presence in China, with new stores opened this year in Beijing and Macau and a second store in Shanghai opening in December. Asia Pacific comps have gained 21% year-to-date.", "Sales in Europe were also strong. Comparable store sales rose 21% in the quarter, which compared with a 1% decline last year and was above our expectations. London represents more than half of our European sales and we noted considerable strengthen all four stores there, as well as strength in our stores in Italy, France and Germany. This year, we opened our 14th retail location in Europe with a store in Vienna. We also completed the extensive renovation of our flagship store on Old Bond Street in July and since then sales have meaningfully increased in that important store. European comps have increased 20% in the year-to-date.", "Rounding out international sales in the third quarter were solid increases in Canada and Latin America, and we are very much looking forward to opening a prominent Tiffany & Co. Store in Vancouver next week.", "Finally, Tiffany's other channel of distribution, which has several components, posted a 23% sales increase in the third quarter. More than half of that growth came from a meaningful and expected increase in wholesale sales of diamonds that are below our quality standards. As you know, our objective for these wholesale sales is to simply recoup our cost.", "Also in this channel, Little Switzerland sales rose 9% in the quarter, although that continued to be below our expectations. Lastly, a doubling of the Iridesse store base this year is contributing to their sales growth and we recently enhanced Iridesse.com when we launched e-commerce. So that covers our four channels of distribution.", "From an overall merchandising perspective, the sales strength in the quarter was concentrated more toward higher-end jewelry. There was substantial growth in diamond statement jewelry as well as in fine jewelry such as our Swing and Legacy collections with diamonds and colored stones; and, we saw double-digit growth in engagement jewelry in the U.S. and many international markets except Japan.", "It also looks like Celebration rings have become a perennial winner and we continue to expand that assortment with new designs. The designer jewelry category grew in the quarter fueled entirely by the incremental sales of Frank Gehry's jewelry collections which are exceeding our expectations. And of course, the 1837, Atlas and Return to Tiffany collections in gold and silver remain fashionable favorites.", "Let's now look at the rest of the income statement. Gross margin of 53.6% in the third quarter was one-half point below the prior year and was slightly below our expectations. The decline was due to wholesale sales of diamonds and higher product costs, partly offset by sales leverage on fixed costs. We recorded a LIFO charge of $10.4 million in the quarter versus $4.2 million in last year's third quarter. We've increased retail prices in 2006 to address these cost pressures.", "SG&A expenses rose 8% in the quarter which was exactly what we expected and represented a moderation in year-over-year growth from the faster rate in the first half. The majority of the third quarter increase reflected anticipated store-related and marketing-related spending. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales was 45.5% versus 46.1% in the third quarter a year ago. You should note that is SG&A expenses in the third quarter of 2005 had included $4.3 million of charges related to business disposition.", "Other expense net in the third quarter was actually income of $1.2 million instead of the typical net expense. The change was largely related to pre-tax gains of $5.2 million associated with the sale of equity investments in an online retailer and a manufacturer, both of which had been written off in previous years. We also realized a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.6 million on the disposition of some marketable securities. The after-tax benefit of these two gains was approximately $0.03 per diluted share. Without these various gains, other expense net would have been an expense of $5.5 million, or higher than the $4.3 million last year, due to interest expense on higher average borrowings. We expect a similar year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter.", "Tiffany's effective tax rate in the third quarter was 35.6% compared with 33% in last year's third quarter. In both periods, we had favorable reserve adjustments relating to the expiration of certain statutory periods during the respective quarters, but the favorable effect was greater last year. So adding it all up, Tiffany's reported net earnings rose 23 % in the third quarter to $29.1 million or $0.21 per diluted share.", "I'll now turn the call over to Jim.", " Jim Fernandez ", "Thanks, Mark. All in all, we were pleased and encouraged with Tiffany's third quarter results. We achieved solid growth in the U.S. while strong growth in most international markets more than offset continued softness in Japan. On a trailing four quarter basis, return on average assets was 9% and return on average stockholders equity was 14%, both of which are close to the minimum long-term objectives we set for at least a 10% ROA and at least a 15% ROE. Tiffany has the financial strength, the infrastructure and the commitment to grow our business and the potential to meet or exceed our profitability targets.", "Let's look at Tiffany's balance sheet. At October 31, accounts receivable were up 16% over a year ago, partly due to sales growth and also reflecting some shift in credit card usage toward Tiffany's in-house card. In total, receivables are turning at a high 19 times per year. Net inventories at October 31 were 19% higher than a year ago and higher than initially planned, but part of the year-over-year increase can be attributed to an unusually low base in October of 2005.", "Higher raw material and work-in-process inventories were related to internal manufacturing and diamond sourcing activities. Higher precious metal costs also represented part of the increase. Higher finished goods were largely related to new stores and certain existing stores, as well as broadened product assortments. We now expect inventory levels to increase by a low double-digit percentage for the full year which is somewhat higher than our previous expectation. However, we do expect sales results to benefit from high in-store availability levels.", "To support our business and sales growth, Tiffany's two distribution centers are also in very good shape. They are efficiently handling store replenishment requirements and are ready to accommodate the expected surge in e-commerce and catalogue orders in the next few weeks.", "Tiffany stepped up its pace of share repurchases in the third quarter, taking advantage of the recently increased authorization that was approved by our Board of Directors in August. We spent approximately $100 million to repurchase 3 million shares in the quarter, representing an average cost of $33.42 per share. Year-to-date, we've spent $264 million to repurchase 7.7 million shares representing approximately 5% of the shares outstanding at the start of the year. The current repurchase program expires in December of 2009 and we intend to act opportunistically in our share repurchase decisions.", "We finished the quarter with $58 million of cash and cash equivalents, total short-term and long-term debt of $661 million and total stockholders equity of almost $1.7 billion. The ratio of total debt to stockholders equity was 39% at October 31st compared with 24% a year ago. The increase reflected borrowings for share repurchases and higher inventory levels.", "In today's press release, we increased our full-year earnings outlook to $1.79 to $1.84 per diluted share. To achieve that expectation, we are looking for total sales to increase approximately 10% for the year which includes U.S. comparable store sales growth in a mid single-digit range and international comp store sales on a constant exchange rate basis, growing in the high single-digit range.", "We are now looking for gross margin for the year to be slightly lower than the prior year, which implies a decline in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect a high single-digit increase in SG&A expenses for the year with a similar rate of increase in the fourth quarter. We now expect other expenses net to be in the area of $13 million to $14 million for the year, which is lower than we originally thought at the start of the year, reflecting the gains in the third quarter. Excluding the gains recorded, other expenses net would be close to the $20 million we had expected. We also expect an effective tax rate of approximately 37% for the year.", "We believe Tiffany is well prepared for this holiday season. Mark mentioned merchandising highlights in the third quarter. On a related note, we held an exhibition in our New York flagship store in the last week of October called Simply Spectacular. It was tied into the recent publication of our annual blue book and showcased the extraordinary jewelry shown in that book. I can tell you that there was considerable customer attendance at the one week exhibition and the interest shown has continued, certainly indicating customers willingness to spend.", "At more modest price points, charms are getting a renewed focus with a new twist at Tiffany. Based on customer requests, we've introduced a wide assortment of sterling silver charms for bracelets and necklaces, with a Tiffany exclusive lock mechanism that allows customers to make designs that reflect their own style. At higher price points, we have our new Tiffany Stars diamond collection with an assortment of styles. We certainly have exciting new designs at intermediate price points too, including Tiffany's new Novo diamond engagement ring, which is currently available in Japan and will be launched in the United States and other markets in early 2007.", "Wrapping up my remarks, we are now almost halfway through the November-December holiday shopping season, at least from a calendar perspective. Tiffany's worldwide sales growth in November to date is currently running ahead of our expectation. Our expectation for the holiday season and fourth quarter includes U.S. Comp store sales increasing in the high single-digit range and international comps on a constant exchange rate basis growing in the mid single-digit range. We are currently exceeding those comp store sales expectations as well.", "Of course, keep in mind that the vast majority of Tiffany's holiday business to be transacted is still ahead of us in December, so we will not and would advise you not to extrapolate results in November to the entire holiday season and fourth quarter, but at least we are enjoying a good start.", "We plan to update you on Tiffany's holiday sales results on January 10th. Until then, our best wishes to you for an enjoyable holiday season.", "That concludes this call. Of course, please feel free to call Mark with any questions or comments and thank you for listening.", "Operator", "Thank you.

(NYSE:TIF)   F4Q06 Earnings Call  March 26, 2007  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Mike Kowalski \u2013 Chairman and CEO ", " Jim Fernandez \u2013 CFO ", " Mark Aaron \u2013 Investor Relations", "Operator", "Good day, everyone and welcome to this Tiffany & Co. fourth quarter earnings conference call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. Participating on today's call is the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mark Aaron; the Chairman and CEO, Mr. Mike Kowalski; and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. James Fernandez.", "At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark Aaron", "Thank you. Good morning and thanks to all of you for joining us. On today's conference call, Jim and I will review Tiffany's fourth quarter and full year performance and then Mike will have some comments about our business for the coming year.", "Please first note Tiffany's Safe Harbor statement, that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's 2005 report on Form 10-K and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Now we can proceed.", "With Tiffany's strong fourth quarter sales increase, we capped off a year of geographically broad-based growth in most markets. Let's begin by looking at fourth quarter sales in Tiffany's channels of distribution, which were closely correlated to the sales trends for the November/December holiday period that we had reported on January 10.", "U.S. retail sales rose 13% in the fourth quarter. Comparable store sales rose 9% due to an increase in the average amount spent per transaction, which we also saw throughout the year. But we were also pleased to see an increase in the number of transactions on a comp-store basis.", "Sales growth in the quarter ranged across many jewelry categories and price points, from silver jewelry under $500 to diamond jewelry over $50,000. However, the largest percentage sales growth was at the high end in both the quarter and the year.", "The comp increase slightly exceeded our expectation and was on top of a 5% comp increase in last year's fourth quarter. The monthly trend ranged from an 11% increase in November to an 8% increase in December and a 15% increase in January.", "Sales in our New York flagship store rose 17% in the quarter and comparable sales in our seven stores in the New York market outside of Manhattan rose 13%. Comparable brand store sales rose 8% in the quarter and the growth was pretty much spread from coast to coast. However, sales declined in Hawaii and Guam, which was entirely due to lower sales to Japanese travelers.", "Overall U.S. retail sales growth in the fourth quarter largely resulted from increased sales to U.S. customers. It was not surprising that our New York flagship store benefited from increased sales to foreign visitors who took advantage of their strong foreign currencies. However, for the full year, foreign tourists accounted for 11% of U.S. retail sales versus 12% in the prior year.", "Regarding the sales strength in the New York flagship store, it's also worth noting that we had hosted our Simply Spectacular event at the end of October featuring an extraordinary assortment of jewelry from our legendary Annual Blue Book and many subsequent sales occurred in the fourth quarter. The New York store is also likely benefiting from the conclusion last September of the multi-year store renovation.", "For the year, U.S. comp store sales rose 5%, the New York flagship store increased 9%, brand store comps rose 4% in 2006, with the largest percentage increases in our Houston, Palm Beach, and Seattle stores. The New York flagship store represented 9% of company-wide sales in 2006 versus 10% in the prior year. In addition, the flagship store has achieved record sales productivity of more than $6,000 per gross square foot, a level not seen since the year before we added 25% to its square footage back in 2001.", "In regard to our five largest U.S. brand stores by sales volume in 2006, the largest one was the South Coast Plaza store in Costa Mesa, California, followed by our highly successful stores in Chicago, Beverly Hills, San Francisco, and Las Vegas.", "In 2006 we increased the number of U.S. store locations by 8% and our gross square footage by 4%, with the opening of new stores in Nashville, Indianapolis, Atlantic City, Tucson and on the big island of Hawaii. We're very pleased with their performance.", "Let's now look at International Retail sales, which increased 15% in dollars in the fourth quarter. On a constant exchange rate basis, which excludes the effect of translating foreign currency denominated sales into U.S. dollars, international retail sales rose 12% and comparable store sales rose 6%.", "Strong sales growth in most of our international markets more than offset continued softness in Japan. Tiffany sales in Japan have historically represented the largest portion of our international channel. However, you should note that in 2006 the growth of our international store base propelled sales in Europe, Asia Pacific, Canada, Latin America and elsewhere to a size that now slightly exceeds our sales volume in Japan. In fact, Japan represented 49% of international retail sales in 2006 versus 54% in 2005.", "You can refer to the non-GAAP measure schedule attached to today's press release and note that my following comments are on a constant exchange rate basis.", "In the fourth quarter, total retail sales in Japan were equal to the prior year, with an increase in average price offsetting a decline in unit volume. Comparable store sales in Japan declined 4% which was slightly below our expectation, but was on top of 7% comp increase in last year's fourth quarter. The yen averaged 118 to the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter, versus 117 a year ago, which meant that the year-over-year comparison in yen and dollars was virtually the same. The monthly comp store sales trend included declines of 4% in November, 5% in December, and 5% in January.", "For the quarter, comp sales store declined 4% in Tokyo and 5% outside Tokyo. Reiterating what we've said in recent months, the luxury retail market in Japan and for consumer household spending in general, is challenging. However, we are focused on improving the in-store shopping experience, on cultivating long-term customer relationships, and on upgrading the physical presence of certain boutique locations through renovations and/or relocations. We are convinced that such initiatives can generate improved sales performance.", "In 2006 we opened four new locations while closing two older ones. For the full year, a 4% increase in total retail sales in Japan was largely due to higher jewelry unit volume, while for the second consecutive year, comparable store sales equaled the prior year.", "Outside Japan, Asia Pacific comparable store sales surged 22% in the quarter, which was on top of a 13% increase last year, and it was led by very strong growth in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Australia. We're also pleased with our performance in China, where we added stores in Beijing, Shanghai and Macao in 2006. For the full year, Asia Pacific comps rose 22% on top of an 8% increase in 2005.", "Europe was also very strong with a 19% increase in comp-store sales in the quarter, which compared with a 1% increase last year. European sales were strong in all markets and especially in London, which represents the majority of our European sales. In 2006 we completed the renovation and expansion of our London flagship store on Old Bond Street and it's been posting strong growth ever since. For the full year, European comps rose 20% with solid growth in all countries compared with a 1% increase in 2005.", "Rounding out international sales, we achieved double-digit comp store sales growth in Canada and Mexico in 2006. We expanded Tiffany's presence with a store in Vancouver and one in Monterrey and both are posting excellent initial results.", "During the year we increased a number of company-operated Tiffany & Co. international stores and boutiques by 8% and the related gross square footage by 10%. At the end of 2006, we operated 167 Tiffany & Co. stores and boutiques in 18 countries, which represented an 8% increase in the number of locations in the U.S. and internationally. We increased total square footage by 6% in 2006 to approximately 792,000 gross square feet, including 486,000 square feet in the U.S. and 306,000 square feet internationally.", "Returning to the U.S., direct marketing sales rose 10% in the fourth quarter, which was on top of a 15% increase last year. Direct marketing sales rose 11% for the year on top of an 11% increase in the prior year. In both periods, these increases were very close to our expectations.", "During 2006, sales growth came from increases in the number of Internet orders and in the average amount spent per Internet and catalog order. The average amount spent per direct marketing order rose to $231 in 2006 versus $221 in the prior year. Tiffany's e-commerce business has become highly successful since being launched seven years ago, while catalog sales have declined along with a reduction in catalog circulation. In fact, we mailed 22 million catalogs in 2006 versus 26 million catalogs seven years ago, while e-commerce sales in the U.S. have grown to be four times the size of catalog sales. Not surprisingly, this has had very favorable implications for profitability over that seven-year period.", "Finally, sales in Tiffany's other channel rose 48% in the fourth quarter and 18% for the full year. The majority of growth in this channel in the quarter and the year came from increased wholesale sales of diamonds obtained through our rough diamond sourcing program, but not put into production due to their lower quality.", "In our specialty retail businesses, Little Switzerland represents more than half of the other channel and their sales rose 11% in the quarter and the 6% in the year. In addition, Iridesse sales rose in the quarter and year, partly due to comp store sales growth, but also from a doubling of their store base from six to 13 stores. So that covers sales in our four channels of distribution.", "From a merchandising perspective, Tiffany's sales growth in the quarter occurred in a wide range of jewelry categories. Diamond jewelry sales were especially strong, including engagement rings, necklace, studs and bracelets. This was also true throughout the year.", "In terms of the average price per unit sold in 2006, for statement jewelry, the average price per piece sold in the U.S. rose to $91,000 from $81,000 in 2005. The average for a solitaire diamond engagement ring in the U.S. was unchanged at $10,400 while the average in Japan was $4,100 versus $4,200 in 2005.", "Complementing the growth of our classics, we expanded our successful Swing and Legacy collections with additional designs incorporated colored stones and we launched Tiffany's Star collection. We also recently introduced Tiffany's Novo diamond engagement rings and initial customer response was very favorable.", "From a different perspective, we launched the unique jewelry designs of Frank Gehry in 2006 and sales have exceeded our expectations. In the gold and silver jewelry categories, Tiffany's Atlas, 1837 and Return to Tiffany\u2019s collections are perennial favorites, while a variety of new silver charms are delighting customers.", "The average price per unit sold in silver jewelry in the U.S. rose slightly to $191 in 2006 versus $187 in 2005, while in Japan it rose to $221 versus $215 in the prior year. We are encouraged with our sales performance in most countries and in most jewelry categories.", "I'll now turn the call over to Jim.", " Jim Fernandez", "Thanks, Mark. I'll begin my comments by reviewing the rest of the income statement. Gross margins declined 1.6 points in the fourth quarter and three-tenths of a point in the year, which were lower than our expectations in the start of 2006. There were a myriad of factors causing the declines, but meaningful factors were higher precious metals cost and increase in wholesale sales of diamonds, which earn virtually no margin, and changes in sales mix. Sales leverage on fixed costs provided a partial offset to those factors.", "The higher product costs were partly reflected in our reported LIFO inventory charges of $13 million in the fourth quarter and almost $33 million for the year, both of which were substantially higher than a year ago. We increased retail prices during 2006 to address these higher product costs and are positioned well for 2007.", "SG&A expenses increased 12% in the fourth quarter, but the increase included the $6.9 million impairment charge for the write-off of goodwill related to our Little Switzerland business. The pre-tax $6.9 million charge also reduced net income by $6.9 million and fully diluted earnings per share by $0.05 per share.", "For the full year, a 10% increase in SG&A was slightly above our initial, high single-digit expectations, reflecting store-related and marketing-related costs and the impairment charge. However, despite increasing our total advertising cost to 6.2% of net sales in 2006 versus 5.7% of sales in 2005, the full-year expense ratio of 40% was one-tenth of a point below the prior year.", "Earnings from operations increased 11% in the fourth quarter and 9% in the year. The full year operating margin of 15.7% was slightly lower than the prior year. Other expenses net of $11 million in the full year were lower than our $20 million expectation at the start of the year. However, in the third quarter, we had recorded income and gains of approximately $7 million related to the disposition of marketable securities and the sale of equity investments in an online retailer and manufacturer, both of which had been written off in previous years.", "Tiffany's effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 36.6% and 37.2% for the full year. The tax rate in the year was slightly below our initial expectation of 38%. In addition, our effective tax rates in fiscal 2005 were only 29.9% in the quarter and 30.8% in the year, which reflected a tax benefit from repatriation of foreign earnings related to the provisions in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Those benefits had amounted to $0.10 per diluted share in the fourth quarter and $0.16 per diluted share in the year.", "Earnings before income taxes increased 11% in the fourth quarter and 10% in the year. Adding it all up, net earnings in the quarter and the year were virtually equal to the prior year. However, earnings growth met our expectations, factoring out the impairment charge in this year's fourth quarter. Earnings for the year rose to $1.80 per diluted share, which achieved the expectation of $1.77 to $1.82 per share we set out at the beginning of 2006. Excluding the impairment charge of $0.05 per diluted share, which we did not include in our last public forecast, EPS would have also been at the high end of the most recent guidance of $1.82 to $1.85 per diluted share.", "Tiffany's return on average assets was 9% in 2006 and our return on average stockholder's equity was 14%, both of which were close to our long-term objectives to achieve at least a 10% ROA and at least 15% ROE.", "Tiffany's balance sheet at January 31st included cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $192 million, short-term and long-term debt totaling $518 million and stockholder's equity of $1.8 billion. The ratio of total debt to stockholder's equity increased to 29% from 26% a year ago.", "In fiscal 2006, accounts receivable rose 19%, which was partly due to sales growth and also reflected some shift in credit card usage towards Tiffany's in-house card which some customers have used to finance larger purchases. Receivable turnover was 18 times for 2006 compared with 19 times in the prior year.", "Net inventories increased 15% in fiscal 2006, which was higher than our expectations. Inventory growth during the year was affected by new store openings along with our decision to deepen assortments in certain existing stores along with broadened product offerings, all of which we believe are benefiting sales results. Higher raw material and work in process inventories are largely due to expanded diamond sourcing operation as well as increased precious metal costs.", "Tiffany's capital expenditures were approximately $182 million in 2006, which at 7% of net sales, was close to our initial expectations and was consistent with our objective to spend, on average, no more than 7% to 8% of net sales. Going forward, we now project that CapEx will average 6% to 7% of net sales.", "One other factor affecting the balance sheet was our substantial share repurchase activity in 2006. In August, Tiffany's Board of Directors increased the authorization for repurchases and we took advantage of it. For the full year we spent $281 million to repurchase 8.1 million shares at an average cost of $34.50 per share, compared with spending $133 million in 2005.", "We highlighted our financial expectations for 2007 in today's press release. Specifically, we said we are looking for net sales growth of 11% to 12% for the full year. This would include a high single-digit increase in comparable store sales on a constant exchange rate basis, consisting of similar growth both in the U.S. and internationally.", "The international comp store sales expectation includes increases of low single-digits in Japan and low double-digits for Europe and Asia-Pacific outside Japan. From a translation perspective, we are planning the Japanese yen at 125 to the dollar versus 117 in 2006.", "As we've previously announced, we expect to accelerate the rate of store openings by increasing the number of company-operated Tiffany & Co. stores and boutiques by approximately 10% in 2007. That reflects adding approximately 17 Tiffany & Co. stores net of closing a couple of underperforming boutiques in Japan, which should increase worldwide gross square footage by roughly 8%. We will also expand the number of independently-operated locations in certain international markets.", "In other sales channels, we are looking for mid-teens increase in direct marketing sales with strong Internet sales and with catalog mailings approximately 10% lower than 2006. Lastly, we expect at least a 25% increase in other sales due to growth in wholesale diamond sales and our specialty retail sales.", "We expect Tiffany's operating margin to increase approximately one-half point in 2007, mostly due to an improvement in gross margin that comes from sales mix, leverage on fixed costs, and assumes stabilization in product costs.", "We expect only minimal improvement in the SG&A expense ratio in 2007 due to some initial expense pressure from an accelerated rate of store expansion. We expect other expenses net to be in the range of $21 million to $23 million in 2007, which would represent a modest increase from 2006 if you exclude the $7 million of gains from sales of investments and securities that we recorded in the third quarter of 2006. The increase would be due to higher interest expense.", "We also expect Tiffany's effective tax rate to be approximately 38% in 2007, which is higher than the 37.2% rate in 2006.", "In total, we currently expect Tiffany's earnings per diluted share to increase 15% in 2007, which is at the high end of the guidance we had published in January. We are planning for healthy EPS growth in most quarters, but less so in the third quarter when we will compare to the nonrecurring gains from the sale of investments and securities in 2006.", "On the balance sheet, we are expecting a high single-digit percentage increase in inventories, which based on our sales expectation, would lead to improved turnover. We also expect capital expenditures of approximately $180 million or 6% of net sales and we certainly expect to continue our active share repurchase program.", "Tiffany is well-positioned financially and operationally to pursue its strategies and to achieve solid sales and earnings growth. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Mike.", " Mike Kowalski ", "Thanks, Jim. I certainly agree that Tiffany's foundation for growth is solid and I share the enthusiasm about our entire management team about the many opportunities we are pursuing in 2007 and beyond.", "However, before looking forward, it is worth repeating some of our successes in 2006. We achieved solid comp store sales growth in the U.S. and most international markets. In fact, Tiffany's international retail channel reached a milestone with sales of $1 billion. We were disappointed with results in Japan, but believe our ongoing investment in the Japanese market is appropriately calibrated against the market opportunity there.", "Worldwide, we opened a substantial number of new stores which has generated excellent results while completing the multi-year renovations and expansions of our flagship stores in New York and in London.", "Our merchants delivered an exciting array of new products, spanning a wide range of designs and price points, and the introduction of Frank Gehry\u2019s new designs generated both enormous excitement and significant sales.", "Our marketing and public relations initiatives delivered Tiffany's message of compelling designs to a growing number of customers, initiatives which included the start of e-mail marketing in the United States, the launch of an informational web site in China, and on a global scale, the continuation of the Celebration campaign that has so successfully engaged the self-purchase fine jewelry customer; as well as the launch of the Frank Gehry collection with its high-profile launch events around the world and its provocative advertising imagery.", "In summary, our 2006 results demonstrated that the Tiffany brand is strong, relevant and clearly focused. While we are pleased with our performance and commend our employees around the world, we do have the potential to perform even better. We have exciting plans in place for 2007 and we have the financial strength and the management expertise to deliver against those plans.", "As previously announced, we are accelerating our store expansion plans in the United States from a rate of three to five stores per year to a new rate of five to seven stores annually, reflecting the excellent results we have experienced in the numerous unserved markets that have significant sales potential. We just recently opened a store in Austin, Texas, and have announced exciting plans for a store on Wall Street this fall. A second store in Las Vegas in the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace, stores in Massachusetts and New Jersey with additional U.S. stores in the works.", "Internationally, we expect to open approximately ten new stores in 2007. We recently added an additional location in Korea, are adding three stores in Japan while closing several; new stores in Hamburg, Germany and at the Singapore airport, and we are planning additional locations in several other countries.", "We continue to build an e-commerce business that has solid growth potential. Our distribution centers are efficiently handling store replenishment and the fulfillment of direct customer orders and our manufacturing and sourcing infrastructure performs well.", "In our specialty retail operations, we've expressed our disappointment with the results of Little Switzerland, however, we remain pleased and optimistic about our progress in building the Iridesse brand and we'll continue to add additional stores this year while we refine our assortment in anticipation of greatly-accelerated growth in 2008.", "Tiffany's product development program will deliver an array of new designs in 2007 to span a wide range of materials, price points and styles, and we have a significantly aggressive marketing plan to enhance product and brand awareness.", "In this morning's press release, we also commented on the start of fiscal 2007, which began with strong sales growth in February, including a robust Valentine's Day. Being almost two months into the first quarter, we are pleased with better than expected sales trends in the United States and most international markets except Japan, but we've noted a greater than expected shift in sales mix towards higher end, lower margin diamond jewelry. Therefore, we are currently on track to achieve our overall earnings growth expectations.", "The year 2007 marks the passage of 170 years since Charles Lewis Tiffany opened his store on lower Broadway in 1837, creating a brand that has since become among the widely known, trusted and admired in the jewelry world. We will continue to build upon that unique and invaluable heritage, pursuing a strategy to expand the reach of the Tiffany\u2019s Co. brand that are consistent with our brand character, that make sense to our core customers, that are competitively viable and that have meaningful and sustainable growth potential.", "That concludes this conference call.

F2Q07 (Qtr End 7/31/07) Earnings Call Transcript", "url": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/46312-tiffany-and-co-f2q07-qtr-end-7-31-07-earnings-call-transcript?part=single", "date": "2007-09-04 00:00:00", "company": "TIF", "executives": "Parsing error", "analysts": "Parsing error", "body": ["Tiffany & Co. (NYSE:TIF)  F2Q07 Earnings Call  August 30, 2007  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Mark Aaron -IR", " Jim Fernandez - CFO", "Operator", "Good day, everyone and welcome to Tiffany & Co. second quarter earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today's call is the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mark Aaron and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. James Fernandez.", "I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark Aaron ", "Thank you, good morning. On today's conference call, Jim and I will review Tiffany's performance in the second quarter and also comment on plans and expectations for the balance of the year.", "First, please note Tiffany's Safe Harbor provision, that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's 2006 report on Form 10-K and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Now we can proceed.", "While looking at the numbers we reported this morning, we think you will agree that Tiffany's second quarter was a very strong one. Sales growth was geographically broad-based around the U.S. and in most international markets, with total sales up 19% and worldwide comparable store sales up 13% on a constant exchange rate basis. Product sales growth continued to be stronger at higher price points, but we also achieved quite acceptable growth in categories at more moderate price points.", "Gross margin was seven-tenths of a point below the prior year but the strong sales growth provided substantial leverage on cost and enabled us to improve the expense ratio by 3 full points from last year. All of this led to Tiffany's earnings from continuing operations increasing by a very strong 41%, which was better than we expected.", "Lastly, we recently announced that Tiffany had entered into an agreement to sell Little Switzerland, which generated a one-time charge to earnings. As a result, net earnings of $37 million were 10% below the prior year, and the $0.26 diluted earnings per share was down from $0.29 in the prior year.", "It was clear that the underlying tone of Tiffany's business was very good in the quarter. Let's begin by looking at sales results in our four channels of distribution. U.S. retail sales increased 20% in the second quarter, which was well above our expectations, primarily due to higher spending per transaction, as well as some increase in the number of transactions. Overall, our price stratification analysis indicated substantial sales growth at higher price levels. However, while the largest percentage growth was in sales over $50,000 we saw growth in all price strata we measure, including those under $500. But there was stronger growth in sales and transactions as we moved up the price ladder.", "Diamond jewelry sales in the U.S. were again a stand-out category. In fact, engagement jewelry sales alone were up more than 25% in the quarter, which leads us to believe that Tiffany is increasing its market share by outperforming industry growth and most competitors. Many of our other diamond jewelry categories also performed strongly in the quarter.", "The other good news in the U.S. is that we saw healthy growth in silver jewelry, highlighted by new silver charms. Designer jewelry sales also rose nicely, paced by the success of Frank Gehry designs but also by solid growth in the designs of. Jean Schlumberger and Paloma Picasso. Tabletop sales continued to decline and watch sales rose modestly.", "U.S. comp store sales rose by a strong 17%, which was well above our high single-digit expectation and was on top of a 5% increase in last year's second quarter. U.S. comps were strong throughout the quarter, with a 20% increase in May on top of a 6% increase in the prior year, a 10% increase in June on top of an 8% prior year increase, and a 22% increase in July, which compared with a 1% decline in July 2006.", "From a regional perspective, sales surged 31% in the New York flagship store on top of a 5% increase last year, which partly reflected strong sales to foreign tourists as well as the likely benefit from the store renovation that was completed last September. Comps rose 2% in the seven branch stores in the New York market.", "Looking around the U.S., sales for all comparable brand stores increased 14% in the second quarter on top of a 4% increase last year. Most stores performed well, but the stores with noteworthy increases were in Boston, Orlando and Palm Beach Gardens, Houston, Beverly Hills, and Bellevue, Washington. It was only in the Pacific region of Hawaii and Guam where we saw continued, albeit modest, sales decline.", "Our analysis of customer mix indicated broad customer demand in the quarter. The majority of the U.S. retail sales increase came from local customers, but there was also a sizable increase in sales to foreign visitors. Our New York flagship store alone served almost half of those foreign visitors, including a significant number of European shoppers who are enjoying the benefits of strong currencies.", "The new stores that we've opened in the U.S. over the past year are performing very well and we're on schedule to open six additional stores in the second half of the year. In Providence, Rhode Island; Natick, Massachusetts; Santa Barbara, California; and Red Bank, New Jersey, as well as a second store in Las Vegas, Nevada which opens tomorrow, and a store right here in Manhattan at 37 Wall Street.", "Looking beyond the U.S., we achieved excellent results in the majority of our international markets, which more than offset softness in Japan. International retail sales increased 16% in the quarter. On a constant exchange rate basis, which excludes the effect of translating foreign currency denominated sales into U.S. dollars, international retail sales rose 17% and comparable store sales increased 7%.", "Similar to product trends in the U.S., international sales except in Japan were driven by growth in a wide range of categories, including diamond jewelry and engagement jewelry as well as silver jewelry and designer jewelry. My following comments about international sales by region will be on a constant-exchange-rate basis.", "Let's start with Japan. Total retail sales in Japan declined by 1% in the quarter, as an increase in average price per unit sold was offset by a decline in units. While there was some sales growth in fine and engagement jewelry, there was a decline in name designer jewelry sales. Comparable store sales declined 6%, which was below our expectation calling for a modest decline, and compared with a 2% increase last year.", "By month, comps in Japan declined 10% in May on top of a 4% increase in the prior year. Comps declined 7% in June on top of a 6% increase in the prior year, and comps declined 1% in July versus a 4% decline last year.", "Geographically, comp store sales declined 3% in Tokyo, including a 2% decline in our Ginza flagship store, while comps declined 7% in locations outside Tokyo. The average yen rate of 122 to the dollar in the second quarter was weaker than the rate of 114 in last year's second quarter, which meant that there was a negative effect from translating Japanese sales into dollars. Specifically, the 1% decline in total Japan retail sales in yen translated into a 7% decline in dollars.", "Despite the sales softness in Japan, we continue to believe we are progressing from a customer development perspective as we expand our relationships with key department store clients and further develop our base of Tiffany register clients in Japan. We are also introducing a number of new products into Japan with a particular focus on stimulating sales in the silver jewelry category and giving it appropriate marketing support.", "We continue to be active on the real estate side in Japan. This year we've opened several new locations, including boutiques in the Sabu Department Store in Tokyo's Shibuya district, in the Takashimaya Department Store in Tokyo's Shinjuku district, and in the Sakuya Department Store in Hiroshima. Earlier this year we closed boutiques in Mitsukoshi Stores in Hoshigaoka and Okinawa. We have announced plans to expand our presence with a new Tiffany for Men concept in the Isitan Department Store in Shinjuku later this year, and plan to add a third location in Nagoya in the Matsuzakaya Department Store.", "Outside of Japan, we benefited from very strong results in other international markets. In the rest of the Asia Pacific region, we posted a 24% comp increase in the quarter, coming from sizable increases in most markets, and especially in Hong Kong, which is benefiting from substantial numbers of Chinese travelers. This 24% comp growth increase was much greater than the low double-digit increase that we expected, and was on top of a 27% comp increase in last year's second quarter.", "We're pleased with performance in the new locations we've opened this year in Seoul, Korea and in Singapore's Changi airport. Two days ago we opened a second store in Macau at the new Venetian Macau Resort. We also have plans to open additional stores in Malaysia and Hong Kong in the second half.", "In Europe, we achieved a 23% comp increase in the quarter, which was also better than the mid-teens increased that we expected, and was on top of a 17% increase last year. Broad-based growth in Europe was led by our four stores in London, including a substantial increase in our flagship store on Old Bond Street. In July, we anniversaried the completion of that store's major renovation and expansion. While London generates more than half of our European sales, we also saw strong sales growth in most continental European markets. Despite the substantial numbers of European visitors shopping at Tiffany stores in the U.S., there's also plenty of demands from Europeans in their home market. We opened a store in Hamburg, Germany during the second quarter, and in the coming months plan to add a fifth store in London and a fourth store in Italy in Bologna.", "Lastly, we are pleased with Tiffany's results in the other Americas. We are posting excellent sales results in Canada, including the new store we opened in Vancouver in late 2006 and are equally pleased with Tiffany's developing business in Mexico where we operate five locations with another opening in Mexico City later this year.", "Turning back to the U.S., our direct marketing channel also had a solid quarter. A 12% sales increase was slightly better than we expected and was on top of an 18% increase last year. The growth was primarily due to an increased number of Internet orders with some increase in the average order size. We continue to see the complementary advantage from having both a website and catalogs which together deliver strong sales growth and marketing exposure. We also continue to edit our catalog mailing, which declined in the quarter in line with our planned 10% reduction in annual catalog circulation. Conversely, we are benefiting from periodic email communications to customers that we began last year. We are excited about our upcoming relaunch of Tiffany.com this fall.", "Lastly, sales in our other channel of distribution increased 151% in the second quarter, mostly due to sharply higher wholesale sales of diamonds. IRRIDESSE sales rose, but it still represents a small portion of the other channel. Results for Little Switzerland are now reported in discontinued operations.", "That cover sales in our four channels of distribution. Let's now look at the rest of the income statement. Gross margin of 55.3% was seven-tenths of a point lower than last year and below our expectations. The largest factor was increased wholesale sales of diamonds. However, it was partly offset by leverage on fixed costs from the strong sales growth.", "Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 11% in the second quarter which was largely due to increased expenses for new and existing stores. However, the strong sales growth provided substantial leverage, resulting in an expense ratio of 39.1% versus 42.1% last year.", "Adding it up, Tiffany's operating earnings from continuing operations increased by a better than expected 39% in the quarter, and the operating margin of 16.2% compared with 13.9% in the prior year. Tiffany's effective tax rate from continuing operations of 39.4% in the second quarter was higher than 37.6% in the prior year, but it was somewhat lower than we had expected. Net earnings from continuing operations increased 41% to $63 million, or $0.45 per diluted share. This far exceeded our expectation for the quarter due to the better than expected sales growth and operating margins.", "As we reported earlier this month, Tiffany entered into an agreement to sell its Little Switzerland business to NXP Corporation. The transaction is expected to close soon. As a result, we took an after-tax charge of $23.6 million, or $0.17 per diluted share in the second quarter. Little Switzerland's second quarter and historical results are now reported as discontinued operations.", "All in all, Tiffany's core business performed very well, and I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Jim.", " Jim Fernandez ", "Thanks, Mark. We're very pleased to have generated such strong operating results in the quarter and are equally pleased with our progress on a number of strategic fronts. Let me first review some balance sheet highlights. Accounts receivable at quarter end were 7% higher than a year ago, due to sales growth. Receivable turnover remained at a very high 18 times per year. Net inventories at quarter end were only 7% above the prior year, and largely due to higher finished goods associated with new stores and expanded product offerings.", "During the quarter, we spent $34 million to repurchase almost 662,000 shares of our common stock at an average cost of $51.69 per share. $636 million of authorization remains under the currently authorized program. I won't predict how much stock we may repurchase in the third quarter, but I will say that we try to take advantage of volatility in our stock price when circumstances permit us to do so.", "All in all, Tiffany finished the quarter with total short-term and long-term debt of $537 million and stockholders\u2019 equity of $1.9 billion, giving us a debt-to-equity ratio of 28% at July 31st, versus 33% at the same time a year ago. As many of you know, our long-term financial performance objectives include achieving a return on average assets of at least 10% and a return on average stockholder's equity of at least 15%. With solid growth in earnings from continuing operations, action to divest Little Switzerland and certain real estate and our share repurchase program, we are positioning Tiffany to achieve those objectives. For the quarter the return on average assets was 9% and the return on average stockholders\u2019 equity was 14%.", "I alluded earlier to the progress we've made so far this year in a number of areas. Our store expansion program is in full gear. We had announced back in January our intention to accelerate the rate of U.S. and international store expansion, and as a result we will be increasing the number of company-operated Tiffany locations by approximately 11% this year, which equates to about 8% growth in worldwide square footage.", "For the year, that includes opening seven stores in the United States and 11 stores and boutiques internationally. The new stores we have opened in recent years have performed well and we continue to see a multitude of exciting expansion opportunities.", "As Mark mentioned, diamond jewelry continued to perform exceptionally well in the quarter, with engagement jewelry delivering excellent growth along with our extraordinary assortment of other jewelry with diamonds. In addition to the classics, customers are responding enthusiastically to newer designs like the Legacy, Swing, and Novo collections, and Tiffany's celebration rings continue to grow in popularity. At other price points, we were also pleased with growth in silver jewelry which includes our very popular new silver charms.", "Product development will continue at the active pace we established over the past few years with an array of new designs ranging from diamond jewelry to silver jewelry. Our venture with Luxottica that we announced last year to introduce Tiffany's first eyewear collection is on track for an exciting launch in 2008. We are also enthusiastic about our strategy to substantially expand wholesale distribution of Tiffany watches in 2008. We are working to finalize plans for that major initiative and hope to be able to provide greater details in the coming months.", "Regarding the sale of Little Switzerland, we had acquired it almost five years ago, but more recently determined that it was simply not a good fit with our business. The sale will result in an improved operating margin going forward which we factored into the earnings expectation that we issued this morning.", "We have also made progress in capital utilization by entering into a sale/leaseback of our Tokyo flagship store. We had acquired that land and building in 2003 in order to secure Tiffany's presence on that prime location. Since then, we have been formulating plans for a renovation and eventual sale of the property. We are currently finalizing plans for an extensive renovation of that store and hope to share those plans with you in the near future.", "Two potential uses of the cash we're generating are dividend increases and share repurchases. Two weeks ago, we announced our second dividend increase of the year. We had increased the dividend by 20% just three months ago, and followed it with this latest 25% increase. In our share repurchase program, we have a substantial amount of repurchase capacity under the current authorization.", "In terms of our outlook for the rest of 2007, we mentioned in today's press release that the third quarter had started well with sales growth in August to date that is achieving our overall U.S. and international expectations. Our current financial performance expectations for 2007 are based in part on a continuation of a reasonably favorable retail environment, but also on the strength of our recent results and exciting plans. We are now expecting approximately 14% total sales growth for the full year, including comp store sales increasing by a low double-digit percentage in the U.S. and high single-digit percentage internationally.", "With international for the second half alone, we expect mid to high teens comps store sales growth in Europe and Asia Pacific. In Japan, comps up slightly. In direct marketing, we expect a mid-teens increase for the year with our optimism tied to the upcoming and exciting relaunch of our website. Lastly, we expect other sales to be up approximately 40% for the year with most of that due to increased wholesale sales of diamonds.", "Also for the full year, we expect gross margin to be down a few tenths of a point due to the decline in the first half, but expect that continued low double-digit growth and SG&A expenses will result in good expense leverage. We think that other expenses net may be closer to $10 million for the year versus our initial expectation for twice that level, as cash proceeds from asset sales result in higher interest income and lower interest expense. We now expect an effective tax rate from continuing operations of approximately 37% for the full year.", "Adding it all up, we are now looking for full-year net earnings of $2.44 to $2.49 per diluted share. Excluding the charge for Little Switzerland and its losses from operations, the gain from the sale of the Tokyo flagship and the related contribution to the Tiffany & Company foundation, that would equate to $2.22 to $2.27 per diluted share, which is higher than our previous expectation of $2.10 to $2.15 per diluted share that we issued three months ago, mostly due to the strong second quarter performance.", "All of us in Tiffany's management are excited about the strength of our business, but also with our many initiatives that should contribute to future sales and earnings growth. We appreciate your ongoing interest and will update you on our progress when we report third quarter results on November 30th.", "That wraps up my comments. Please feel free to call Mark with any questions, and thanks for listening.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Q3 2007 Earnings Call Transcript", "url": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/55923-tiffany-and-co-q3-2007-earnings-call-transcript?part=single", "date": "2007-11-30 00:00:00", "company": "TIF", "executives": "Parsing error", "analysts": "Parsing error", "body": ["Tiffany & Co. (NYSE:TIF) Q3 2007 Earnings Call November 30, 2007  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Mark Aaron \u2013 Vice President, Investor Relations", "James Fernandez \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Operator", "Good day everyone, and welcome this Tiffany & Co. third quarter earnings conference call.  [Operator Instructions]  Participating on today\u2019s call is the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mark Aaron and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. James Fernandez.  At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron, please go ahead sir.", "Mark Aaron", "Thank you and good morning.  Earlier today we reported strong sales and earnings growth for Tiffany\u2019s third quarter.  On this conference call, Jim and I will review those results and also comment on plans and expectations for the balance of the year.", "First please note Tiffany\u2019s safe harbor provision that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward looking statements.  Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward looking statements.  Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany\u2019s 2006 report on form 10-K and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.  Now we can proceed.", "Tiffany\u2019s third quarter was another good one.  Net sales rose 18% on solid growth in most countries.  We also are pleased to experience wide ranging product categories sales growth in a wide range of price points.  Gross margin was only slightly lower than last year and core SG&A expenses were well controlled.", "Net earnings rose significantly to $.71 per diluted share compared with $.21 in the prior year.  There were some meaningful items worth noting in the quarter, including the sale of our Tokyo flagship store property which generated a sizeable gain, and a related contribution to the Tiffany & Co. Foundation.  After adjusting for those items we were quite pleased with Tiffany\u2019s strong overall performance.", "Let\u2019s review the details of the quarter starting with sales performance in our channels of distribution.  US retail sales increased 12% in the third quarter largely driven by increased spending per transaction as well as an increase in the number of transactions.  An 8% increase in comp store sales was in line with our high single digit expectation.  From a price stratification viewpoint there was price [strated] growth in a wide range from under $500 to over $50,000 but the greatest percentage of growth in sales and transactions was in the $4,000 to $50,000 range.  The 8% increase in US comps was on top of a 6% increase in last years third quarter.  The monthly trend fluctuated, starting the quarter with an 11% increase in August on top of a 6% increase in August 2006, followed by a 2% increase in September on top of a 7% increase and finishing the quarter with a 12% increase in October on top of a 4% prior year increase.", "Geographically we posted good growth in most US regions.  Sales in the New   York flagship store surged 25% in the quarter on top of a 13% increase last year, and we\u2019re up 28% year to date with the increases coming from increased transactions and higher spending per transaction.  The flagship stores increase far exceeded a 5% comp store sales increase at our seven other stores in the New   York region.", "In October we held an event in the flagship store that showcased the extraordinary pieces in our new Blue Book.  It was an enormous success with sales substantially exceeding the level of last year\u2019s Simply Spectacular event.", "For all comparable US brand stores, a 4% sales increase was on top of a 4% increase last year.  It was no specific regional pattern, although we do note that a slight increase in comps in California contrasted with the better than average increase in Florida.", "Some branch stores with the largest percentage increases ranged from Bal Harbour and Orlando to Edina and Kansas City to Dallas and San Antonio to Bellevue and Palo Alto.  The Pacific region, which includes Hawaii and Guam, continued to post year over year decline.", "Looking at the customer mix analysis, the US sales increase in the quarter was pretty evenly generated by higher sales to local customers and foreign tourists, of which European visitors represented the largest increase.  For the New   York flagship store, more than half of its 25% sales increase came from higher sales to those foreign tourists.", "We\u2019ve added seven US stores this year in a diverse set of markets and will close a small store in Maui\u2019s Whalers Village by year end.  Openings have included Austin,  Texas, a second store in Las Vegas, Natick, Massachusetts, Providence, Rhode Island, Red Bank, New   Jersey and Santa Barbara,  California and last month we were delighted to welcome some of you to our magnificent new store at 37   Wall Street, which has had a very good start.", "International results in most markets also continued at a strong pace in the third quarter with sales up 22% in dollars on a constant exchange rate basis, international sales rose 18% and comps are up 10%.  My following remarks about international sales performance are on a constant exchange rate basis.", "In Japan, total retail sales rose 6% in the third quarter which was somewhat below what we expected and resulted from a higher average price per jewelry unit sold.  It was comprised of a 2% increase in Tokyo, which included a 3% increase in our Tokyo flagship store and an 8% increase in other regions.", "Comparable store sales declined 1% in the quarter, however, due to the extent of store openings, closings and relocations over the past year, which created a seven point spread between total sales and comp performance.  Looking at total sales performance in Japan may be more relevant at the moment.  In fact, over the past 12 months in Japan we\u2019ve opened six new locations and closed three boutiques and are achieving increased market penetration.", "Just for the sake of consistent reporting, the 1% comp decline in the quarter ranged from a 3% increase in August versus a 5% decline last year to a 1% increase in September versus a 4% decline last year and a 5% decline in October on top of a 7% decline.  The environment remains challenging in Japan but we believe our initiatives are generating the best possible results at this time and the total retail sales growth of 6% in the quarter and 1% in the year to date indicate progress.  Finally, the Yen averaged 116 to the dollar I the third quarter versus 117 last year so the translation effect on results was insignificant.", "In other international markets, sales certainly continued at a robust pace in the third quarter.  The Asia/Pacific region comp store sales rose 29% which was substantially better than the mid teens increase we expected and was on top of a 17% increase in the prior year.  We achieved double digit sales growth in every country in that region.  We\u2019re pleased with the performance of new stores we\u2019ve opened this year in Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Macao and plan to open stores in China in the coming months in the large cities of Tianjin and Chenyang.", "In Europe comp store sales rose 14% which was in line with our expectation and was on top of a 21% increase last year.  Sales were very strong in London, which represents more than half of our European sales but we\u2019re also pleased with large increases in most markets on the continent.  These are obviously very strong results and I\u2019m especially impressed in light of the large number of Europeans who are traveling and shopping in New York.", "This year we\u2019ve opened a fifth location in London in Selfridges Department Store and a store in Hamburg,  Germany, with a store in Bologna,  Italy scheduled to open in December.", "Rounding out international, we are doing very well in Canada, with strong growth in Toronto and excellent results at our new store in Vancouver and sales are also growing in Mexico.", "Turning back to the US, direct marketing sales increased 4% in the quarter which was on top of an 11% increase last year but was below our mid teens expectation.  The 4% sales increase was due to an increased amount spent per order.", "Catalog sales decline in circulation and was 15% lower in the quarter, which was roughly in line with our projected decline in mailings for the year.  The much larger part of direct marketing sales is ecommerce; we\u2019ve re-launched our web site in October with enhanced content, improved graphics and easier navigation.  You may find it interesting to visit tiffany.com and watch the Tiffany holiday video as well as the making of the holiday campaign.", "Lastly, an increase of 137% in sales in our other channels was largely due to higher wholesales of diamonds acquired through our rough sourcing program but that are subsequently determined to not meet our quality standards.", "Sales also increased at Iridesse due to the addition of new stores and we are currently focused on editing the product assortment and seeking ways to increase brand awareness and store traffic.  That covers sales in our four channels of distribution.", "We are also excited with what we saw from a product perspective.  Statement jewelry at the very high end continued to post a sizeable increase in the third quarter.  Engagement jewelry was a strong performer with solitaire diamond ring sales up almost 20% in the US alone.  We even saw single digit increase in Japan, while band ring sales also posted big growth.", "In fashion jewelry, our Charmed by Tiffany product and marketing initiative in silver and gold charms is paying off with strong growth in the US and many international markets as well as a modest increase in Japan.  The named designer category was also up in the quarter and we saw reasonably good growth in watches and in the table ware category.  Generally speaking, it was broad based strength in the jewelry category that propelled our sales growth.  Our Celebration Rings campaign is maintaining popularity and broadening its appeal, our continually expanding Legacy Jewelry Collection in diamonds and colored stones is very strong.  We are pleased with the response to relatively new collections like the Tiffany Somerset Collection of gold and silver mesh designs along with Tiffany\u2019s Swing, stars and hearts platinum diamond jewelry collection.", "Turning to the rest of the earnings statement gross margin was 53.7% in the third quarter versus 54% a year ago and was somewhat below our expectations.  The modest decline reflected higher wholesale sales of diamonds that were partly offset by reduced LIFO inventory charges.  We recorded a LIFO charge of $6.3 million in the quarter versus a charge of $10.4 million last year.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in the quarter with a large part of the increase due to labor and occupancy costs tied to new and existing stores as well as higher marketing expenses.  However, SG&A expenses also included the $10 million contribution we made to the Tiffany & Co. Foundation with proceeds from the sale of the Tokyo flagship store property.  Excluding that contribution SG&A expenses rose 16% and the expense ratio improved from the prior year.", "You should also note on the income statement that the line item other operating income represents $105 million pre tax gain we recorded from the sale of the property housing Tiffany\u2019s Tokyo flagship store.", "Other expense net was $2.3 million in the quarter that compared with income of $1.3 million last year which was largely related to pre tax gains associated with the sale of equity investments and marketable securities.  In total, the $6.8 million gain last year added approximately $.03 per share to last year\u2019s bottom line.  Without those gains, other expense net would have been $5.5 million last year.", "Our effective tax rate from continuing operations of 34% in the third quarter was fractionally higher than last year\u2019s rate.  Adding it all up, net earnings in the third quarter excluding the $.48 gain from the sale of the Tokyo store and the $.04 expense for the contribution to the Tiffany & Co. Foundation was $.27 per diluted share.  Last year\u2019s net earnings excluding the $.03 gain from the sales of investments and securities was $.18 per diluted share so when excluding those various items year over year earnings per diluted share rose 50% and exceeded our expectation.", "We\u2019re pleased with these overall results and presume most shareholders are as well.  Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim.", "Jim Fernandez", "Thanks Mark.  On many fronts it\u2019s been another very active year at Tiffany and especially so in the third quarter.  This year we\u2019ve maintained an active pace of store expansion, we\u2019ve opened seven new stores in the US and by year end we will have added a net of 12 new international locations.  In total, increasing the worldwide number of company operated Tiffany stores by 11% and the square footage by 8%.  We\u2019ve also been active in product development and as Mark mentioned we saw broad based growth in most jewelry categories in the quarter, ranging from diamonds to silver.  Tiffany\u2019s classic designs and newer introductions represent a very powerful offering for customers.", "During the quarter we completed the sale on lease back of our flagship stores in Tokyo and London which was consistent with our long term objectives to monetize those assets while being assured that we can maintain our successful presence at those locations for many years to come.", "As you know, we\u2019ve completed a major renovation of our London store in 2006, by combining two adjacent buildings, which has contributed to excellent sales results there.  We also recently announced that our Tokyo Ginza flagship store will undergo a major renovation in 2008 to dramatically enhance its presence at that important location.  We also completed the sale of Little Switzerland during the third quarter.", "Last month we announced the launch of a new generation of smaller US stores under the working name Tiffany Collections, those stores will be approximately 2,000 square foot each, will carry a wide range of Tiffany jewelry designs, except engagement and very high end statement jewelry and will enable us to further penetrate a number of existing markets as well as to enter smaller but attractive markets.  The addition of this new format should ultimately increase the number of Tiffany stores in the US from our previous objective calling for at least 100 stores to a new objective for as many as 170 stores.", "We are pleased to report that Luxottica is getting ready to introduce the Tiffany Eyewear Collection with a pre launch to select retailers in December and wider distribution of the complete collection starting in January.", "We expect to soon be able to share more details with you about our plans for major expansion of watch distribution beginning in 2008.", "Tiffany\u2019s balance sheet strengthened further in the quarter as the result of the Tokyo, London and Little Switzerland sales.  Cash in short term investments of $391 million of October 31st were seven times higher than a year ago.  Total short term and long term debt of $463 million was 30% lower than a year ago and total debt to stockholders equity was 24% at October 31st versus 39% a year ago.", "We will continue to take advantage of our strong financial position.  During the third quarter we spent $97 million to repurchase almost 1.9 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $51.28 per share.  At the end of the quarter we still had $539 million available under the current authorization and will be opportunistic in our purchases.  In fact, we\u2019ve done exactly that, November to date, by spending $208 million to repurchase 4.4 million shares at an average cost of $46.89.  That leaves us with $331 million available for future repurchases in the current program.", "During the quarter we also announced a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend rate, which followed a 20% increase that our border proved earlier in the year.  Net inventories at October 31st were 8% above the prior year due to new store openings, expanded product assortments, higher precious metal costs and expanded diamond manufacturing and sourcing operations.  Our inventory position is in good shape as we move into this most significant part of the holiday season.", "In accounts receivable on October 31st we\u2019re 14% higher than a year ago, largely reflecting strong sales growth but continuing to turn it 18 times per year.", "Tiffany\u2019s return on average assets improved to 11% which achieves our long term objective for at least a 10% return.  Similarly, the return on average stockholders equity improved to 18% which meets our objective for at least a 15% ROE.", "In terms of our financial objectives for the full year we are now projecting sales growth of approximately 15% which includes comparable store sales increasing 9-10% in the US and in the high single digits internationally on a constant exchange rate basis.  For the fourth quarter, that implies a mid single digit comp increase in the US, strong comp growth in the European and Asia/Pacific regions and a modest increase in total Japan sales.", "We are looking for direct marketing sales to improve in the fourth quarter as we increased the frequency of email messages to customers and generated 10% increase for the year.  We think other sales will be up 50% for the year.", "We are now half way through the all important November/December holiday selling season, although the vast majority of sales activity is still ahead of us in the next several weeks.", "We indicated in today\u2019s press release that sales trends in November were on track with our overall expectations for the quarter.  The macro uncertainties about consumer spending are well known but our stores are well positioned.", "Looking at the rest of the income statement, we expect gross margin to be down a few tenths of a point for the year, which implies a modest increase in the fourth quarter, however, we expect SG&A expense growth of approximately 13% for the year which would result in good expense leverage and an improved operating margin.", "For the full year we also now expect other expenses net in the area of $10 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 37%.  All this should result in net earnings in a range of $2.49 to $2.54 per diluted share for the full year.  If you exclude the charge for Little Switzerland and its losses from operations the gain from the sale of Tokyo flagship store and the associated contribution to the Tiffany Foundation, net earnings would equate to $2.25 to $2.30 for diluted share which is higher than our previous expectation of $2.22 to $2.27 per diluted share that we issued three months ago.", "As I said before, the next few weeks are the key to achieving a successful holiday season and Tiffany is well positioned in every controllable way to achieve one.  We plan to report our holiday sales results on Friday, January 11.  That wraps up my remarks and please feel free to call Mark regarding any questions about our third quarter results and thank you for listening.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]  This concludes today\u2019s conference, thank you for your participation.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

(NYSE:TIF) F4Q07 Earnings Call March 24, 2008  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Mark L. Aaron - Vice President, Investor Relations", "James N. Fernandez - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President", "Michael J. Kowalski  - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Tiffany & Company fourth quarter earnings conference call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. Participating on today\u2019s call are Mike Kowalski, Chairman and CEO; Jim Fernandez, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead.", "Mark L. Aaron", "Thank you. Good morning. Earlier today we reported Tiffany's fourth quarter and full year results and by now you\u2019ve hopefully had a chance to read the press release. On this conference call, Jim and I will review those results and then Mike will add his thoughts about Tiffany's plans for 2008.", "First, please note Tiffany's Safe Harbor provision that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's 2006 report on Form 10-K and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.", "Now we can proceed.", "Tiffany enjoyed a successful year in 2007. For the full year, we achieved broad-based sales growth in most markets and, notwithstanding a U.S. slowdown in the latter part of the year, Tiffany performed well from a financial perspective. Our earnings per share exceeded the growth objective we set at the start of 2007. It also exceeded the forecast we had provided with our holiday sales results in January when adjusted for the various one-time items noted in the press release. And we pursued a number of strategic initiatives during the year. Let\u2019s begin by looking at sales in our four channels of distribution.", "U.S. retail sales rose 4% in the fourth quarter, which was in line with the results we had reported for the November/December holiday season. An increase in the average transaction size was partly offset by a decline in the number of transactions.", "U.S. price stratification for the quarter was similar to the holiday season, mostly reflecting greater sales strength in the higher price ranges of various categories. In essence, silver jewelry sales were soft below $500 but stronger above that price. Similarly, fine jewelry sales from $10,000 to $50,000 were relatively stronger than in the $1,000 to $10,000 range, and while sales over $50,000, which represent almost 10% of U.S. retail annual sales, for the fourth quarter were modestly lower than the prior year, we were pleased to see an increased number of transactions.", "Comparable store sales declined 1% in the quarter. Similar to what we\u2019ve heard from many other retailers, we believe that fourth quarter performance was affected by customers exhibiting some caution tied to various macroeconomic factors.", "The monthly comp trend in the quarter was erratic, ranging from a 7% increase in November, which was on top of an 11% prior year increase, to a 5% decline in December on top of an 8% increase, to a flat comp in January on top of a 15% increase in the prior year.", "Sales in our New York flagship store were strong all year despite tough year-over-year comparisons, increasing 10% in the fourth quarter on top of a 17% prior year increase and 21% for the year on top of a 9% increase. Sales in the nine-store New York region, which includes the flagship store and our new Wall Street store, rose 9% in the quarter and 16% for the year.", "Comparable branch store sales declined 4% in the quarter, with some softness in most markets, but sales increased 4% for the year. Branch store comps had increased 8% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter and 4% for the year.", "Despite the fourth quarter softness, there were some strong performing stores, including Cincinnati, Edina, Houston, and Palo Alto. Sales in Hawaii, where we have four stores, rose fractionally and sales declines in California with 12 stores and Florida with eight stores were roughly in line with the overall brand store comp decline.", "You may find it interesting that for the year, our five largest U.S. branch stores ranked by sales volume were at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, San Francisco, Chicago, Beverly Hills, and in the Bellagio in Las Vegas.", "Tiffany continued to benefit from higher sales to foreign tourists in 2007, especially Europeans visiting our New York store, as well as our branch stores in Orlando, Las Vegas, and San Francisco, along with customers from Japan visiting our stores in Hawaii. In fact, fourth quarter comps in the flagship store entirely reflected higher foreign tourist spending, while for the full year the New York flagship store increase reflected a combination of higher sales to foreign tourists and local customers. Overall, sales to foreign tourists represented 14% of U.S. retail sales in 2007 versus 11% in 2006.", "For the full year, U.S. retail sales rose 11% and comps rose 7%. As a percent of sales, the New York store increased to 20% of U.S. retail sales in 2007 versus 19% in 2006, and the New York flagship store sales approached $300 million in 2007, with sales productivity topping a record $7,000 per gross square foot.", "It was another year of successful store openings. We added seven stores in Austin, Texas; the Forum Shops in Las Vegas; Natick, Massachusetts outside Boston; Santa Barbara, California; Providence, Rhode Island; Red Bank, New Jersey; and the Wall Street store. And in Hawaii, we closed our Whaler\u2019s Village store in Maui. In total, we added a net of six U.S. stores in 2007, which increased our U.S. store base by 9% and square footage by 10%. We are also planning to open six U.S. stores this year.", "So while we were disappointed with how U.S. retail sales finished the year, it was a good year nonetheless and we enhanced our base of distribution.", "Moving to the international side, our international retail sales increased 21% in the fourth quarter due to very strong growth in the Asia-Pacific region outside Japan and solid growth in our stores in Europe, Canada, and Latin America. On a constant exchange rate basis, which excludes the effect of translating foreign currency denominated sales into U.S. dollars, international retail sales rose 14% and comp store sales rose 6%.", "For the year, international sales rose by a strong 19%, with comps of 7% on a constant exchange rate basis. It\u2019s clear that our international business is steadily becoming more geographically diversified. For the full year, international retail sales represented 41% of Tiffany's worldwide net sales, with Japan accounting for 17% versus 19% in the prior year, the Asia-Pacific region outside Japan increasing to 11%, Europe growing to 8%, and the rest of international sales at 5%.", "My following comments will be on a constant exchange rate basis as noted on the non-GAAP measures schedule in today\u2019s press release. Total retail sales in Japan declined 2% in the fourth quarter, as the decline in jewelry units sold primarily in silver jewelry was partly offset by an increased average price. And while silver jewelry sales were soft, we were pleased with an increase in sales of engagement jewelry and in Elsa Peretti\u2019s jewelry design and similar patterns were true for the full year.", "The YEN averaged 110 to the dollar in the fourth quarter versus 118 in the prior year\u2019s quarter, so although Japan retail sales declined 2% in YEN in the quarter, they rose 4% when translated into dollars. For the year, there was minimal translation effect with the YEN virtually unchanged at 117 to the dollar.", "Generally speaking, it is a challenging retail environment in Japan. Comp-store sales in Japan declined 6% on top of a 4% comp decline in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. The comp trend included declines of 4% in November, 6% in December, and 9% in January, versus respective declines of 4%, 5%, and 5% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter.", "Geographically, the 6% comp decline in the quarter was comprised of a 5% decline in Tokyo and a 7% decline outside Tokyo and a similar pattern existed for the full year as well. It\u2019s worth noting that for the full year, comp store sales in Japan declined 5% but total retail sales were equal to the prior year, with the difference representing the importance of new stores and store relocations.", "During the year, we opened four new department store boutiques in the Seibu Department Store in Tokyo\u2019s Shibuya; in the Takashimaya Department Store in Tokyo\u2019s Shinjuku; in the Fukuya Department Store in Hiroshima; and in the Matsuzakaya Department Store in Nagoya, while closing three underperforming locations for a net increase of one location in Japan in 2007.", "More recently, the recent opening of a two-level Tiffany Boutique in the Matsuzakaya Department Store in Tokyo now gives us three street-facing locations on the Ginza and we have nearly completed our plan to convert key department store boutiques from standard format to full concession operations with our own Tiffany trained employees, which enables us to enhance the shopping experience.", "Outside Japan, sales in the rest of the world were, to say the least, quite robust. In the Asia-Pacific region outside Japan, comp-store sales surged 28% in the fourth quarter and 26% in the year, with double-digit percentage growth in every country. These gains were on top of strong 22% comp growth in both last year\u2019s fourth quarter and the full year. Sales in Hong Kong itself represent almost one-third of that region.", "During the year, we added six stores in the region, in Seoul, in Singapore\u2019s Changi Airport, in Macau, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong, and in Tianzhen in China. We finished the year with 34 company-operated Tiffany stores in that region.", "We also experienced another year of strong growth in Europe in 2007. Comp store sales rose 8% in the fourth quarter on top of a 19% increase and rose 13% for the year on top of a 20% increase. Europe was also a picture of broad-based geographical strength, both in London, which represents a little more than half of European sales, and on the continent. We added three European stores in 2007 in Hamburg, London, and Bologna and finished the year with 17 company-operated Tiffany stores in Europe.", "And we continue to be pleased with our developing businesses in Canada with very successful stores in Toronto and Vancouver, and in Mexico where we operate six locations.", "Internationally, we added a net of 11 new stores and boutiques in 2007, representing an 11% increase in retail locations and a 7% increase in square footage. Our plan is to accelerate that pace in 2008 with quite a few new stores and boutiques planned for Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Japan.", "Worldwide, we added a net of seventeen company-operated Tiffany & Company stores and boutiques in 2007, representing a 10% increase in the number of locations. Square footage increased 9% to approximately 860,000 gross square feet, including 533,000 in the U.S. and 327,000 internationally.", "Returning to the U.S., it was not too surprising that our direct marketing channel also experienced a sales slowdown in the fourth quarter. Sales declined 1% in the quarter compared with a 10% increase last year but rose 5% for the year on top of an 11% increase in 2006. The number of orders was up in both periods but the average order size fluctuated.", "For the full year, the average direct marketing order of $233 was virtually unchanged from $231 in the prior year. We relaunched our website in 2007 with enhanced functionality and graphics and are pleased with customer reaction. We also increased the frequency of e-mail communications to customers. Conversely, we reduced catalog mailings by about 10% in the year, although our current plan is to modestly increase circulation in 2008.", "Tiffany's Internet business has grown dramatically with high profitability since being launched in 1999. E-commerce sales of more than $150 million in 2007 represented roughly 80% of the direct marketing channel. E-commerce nicely complements our retail store presence while also acting as an effective marketing communications tool.", "Lastly, sales in the other channel rose 9% in the fourth quarter and 64% in the year. In both periods, the growth mostly came from increased wholesale sales of rough diamonds acquired through our diamond sourcing program and subsequently determined to not meet our quality standards.", "Sales in our Iridesse stores increased in the year due to new store openings but did not meet our expectations.", "So that covers sales by channel of distribution. Briefly looking at some merchandising highlights, it was another very strong year for diamond jewelry at Tiffany and an improving year for silver. The 10% worldwide sales growth in the quarter was spread across a number of jewelry categories.", "Engagement jewelry sales continued at a strong pace in the U.S. and internationally for the quarter and in fact, solitaire diamond ring sales rose more than 20% for the year. The average price of an engagement ring sold rose to $7,000 worldwide in 2007, from $6500 in the prior year.", "Celebration ring sales are also maintaining strong popularity with existing and new designs and the legacy jewelry collection is a solid performer, along with some of the established favorites like the swing, jazz, and bubbles collection.", "At more modest prices, sales of charm jewelry in silver and gold also rose at a strong pace and we are pleased with the results from our new Somerset collection. Of course, ongoing favorites in silver and gold also include the Atlas, 1837, and Return to Tiffany collections. The average price per piece of silver jewelry sold in 2007 rose to $196 worldwide from $189 in the prior year. And name designer jewelry sales posted a decent increase in the quarter and year.", "Lastly, despite some softening in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, worldwide statement jewelry sales for the year were quite strong, most notably in the U.S. as well as in certain international markets. Strong unit growth in statement jewelry was supplemented by an increase in the average price per piece sold to $96,000 worldwide from $93,000 in the prior year.", "I\u2019m now pleased to turn the call over to Jim.", "James N. Fernandez", "Thanks, Mark. It was a very active year at Tiffany, not only in terms of store expansion but also as it related to a number of strategic initiatives. I\u2019ll highlight them as I complete the review of the income statement.", "Tiffany's gross margin in 2007 was affected by various factors, including higher product cost, increased wholesale sales of diamonds that earn a zero margin, and shifts in sales mix. The higher product costs were reflected in the LIFO charges we recorded in 2007 -- $9.9 million in the fourth quarter and $28.7 million for the full year.", "However, the biggest item affecting gross margin in the fourth quarter related to an obsolescence charge we recorded to write-off certain watches as part of our new strategic alliance with The Swatch Group.", "Gross margin of 56.9% in the quarter was seven-tenths of a point lower than the prior year. Excluding the $19 million charge, gross margin would have increased in the quarter due to favorable product sales mix.", "As we announced in today\u2019s press release, we will discontinue utilizing the LIFO accounting method and begin using the average cost method for all inventories beginning in the first quarter of 2008. This will result in our inventory reporting conforming to the manner in which we operationally manage inventories and evaluate retail pricing and also will be consistent with many of our peer companies. We presume that analysts and investors will appreciate this change.", "The tax related cash outflow of approximately $60 million to be paid over four years is not significant given the strength of our balance sheet. In addition, we will provide adjusted figures for the 2007 quarters when we file our report on Form 10-K in the next week.", "SG&A expenses in the quarter and year were also affected by some one-time items. As reported, SG&A expenses increased 28%. However, that increase included two significant items. First, we have fully reserved against the $48 million loan that we made to the Tahera Diamond Corporation. Tahera recently sought protection from creditors and the impairment charge reflects our expectation that the loan will not be repaid.", "Second, we recorded an impairment charge of $16 million related to our Iridesse business based on lower-than-expected store performance and a related reduction in future cash flow projections.", "Excluding those two items, SG&A expenses would have increased 8% and with the 10% sales growth would have resulted in an improved expense ratio. Similarly for the full year, SG&A expenses increased 19% excluding the Tahera and Iridesse charges, as well as a $10 million contribution we made in the third quarter to the Tiffany & Company Foundation from the $105 million gain we realized on the sale leaseback of our Tokyo flagship store, SG&A expenses would have increased 12% in the year. Compared with the 15% sales growth we achieved, we would have shown an improved expense ratio.", "Other expenses net in the quarter and the year were lower than the prior year, largely due to reduced net interest expense as we reduced net debt with operating cash flow and with the proceeds from the sales of the Tokyo and London flagship stores, and the sale of Little Switzerland.", "Tiffany's effective tax rates in both the fourth quarter and the year increased from the prior year but came in pretty close to what we have expected. Therefore, net earnings in the fourth quarter of $118 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, were lower than the prior year but it was due to a number of non-recurring charges. Excluding those one-time items noted in today\u2019s press release, net earnings from continuing operations in the quarter would have increased 14% over the prior year.", "Similarly for the full year, adjusting for those items as well as the substantial gain we recorded from the sale of the Tokyo store, net earnings from continuing operations would have increased 20% and EPS from continuing operations would have been $2.33 per diluted share. This performance exceeded the 15% EPS growth we targeted at the start of 2007.", "We also finished the year with a strong balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments were $247 million versus $191 million a year ago. Our total short-term and long-term debt was $453 million, and our stockholders equity was $1.6 billion. Therefore, total debt represented 28% of equity versus 29% a year ago.", "Net inventories increased 8% in fiscal 2007 to support sales growth, new stores, and diamond sourcing. You should note that approximately half of the increase came from translating international inventories into U.S. dollars and on the other hand, the $19 million obsolescence charge we recorded for watches reduced inventories by almost 2%.", "All in all, we were pleased to achieve an improvement in inventory turnover in 2007 and are in a strong inventory position.", "Net receivables rose 17% in 2007, with about 5% of the increase due to foreign translation. Receivable turnover remained at a very high 18 times a year.", "Capital expenditures were approximately $186 million in 2007 versus $175 million in 2006. As many of you know, we\u2019ve invested heavily in Tiffany's infrastructure in recent years for internal jewelry manufacturing and rough diamond sourcing, as well as for added distributions in our capacity, and are now benefiting from that spending.", "CapEx was 6% of net sales in 2007 and we are planning future spending to continue at a rate of approximately 6% to 7% of sales.", "In our share repurchase program, we were increasingly active as 2007 progressed. After generating substantial proceeds in the third quarter from the sale leasebacks and sale of Little Switzerland, we spent $418 million in the fourth quarter to repurchase 9.3 million shares of our stock at an average cost of $44.99 per share. For the full year, we spent $575 million to repurchase 12.4 million shares at an average cost of $46.44 per share.", "This led Tiffany's board of directors two months ago to increase its authorization for future repurchase by an additional $500 million. At year-end, we had $621 million available for future repurchases through January of 2011 and we intend to be opportunistic in our purchases.", "Tiffany's productivity and profitability was improved in 2007. Return on average assets for the year increased to 11% versus our objective that calls for at least a 10% ROA and return on average stockholders equity rose to 18%, which exceeded our objective that calls for at least a 15% ROE.", "As Mark mentioned, we added a net of 17 company-operated Tiffany locations in 2007, increasing our worldwide store base by 10% and square footage by 9%. For 2008, we are planning almost a 15% increase in a number of worldwide locations and a high single digit increase in square footage, as we accelerate the pace on the international side to take advantage of opportunities in a number of new and existing markets.", "In terms of the financial plans that we initially disclosed last month, we continue to expect a 10% increase in worldwide net sales in 2008, coming from a low single digit increase in the U.S. comp store sales, which reflects the current difficult environment, and a mid single digit increase in international comp store sales, which will range from minimal growth in Japan to considerably stronger growth in Asia-Pacific outside Japan and in Europe. We are also expecting a meaningful contribution from the new stores.", "We are also planning direct marketing sales to increase by a mid single digit percentage for the full year and sales in our other channel to increase by a low single digit percentage in 2008.", "It\u2019s difficult for us to improve our operating margin in this kind of environment and we are looking for operating margin in 2008 to be approximately equal to last year. We will not attempt to forecast the direction of precious metal or diamond costs but we are modestly benefiting from our zero cost collar hedging program that covers a portion of our platinum and silver needs for internal manufacturing.", "Longer term, we have repeatedly said that higher costs will ultimately lead to increased retail prices which is true for the entire industry. We expect other expense net of approximately $20 million in 2008 and an effective tax rate of approximately 36% to 37%.", "We are forecasting net earnings to grow by 5% to 9% and an 11% to 15% increase in diluted earnings per share to a range of $2.75 to $2.85 for 2008, which consists of an increase to our previously issued guidance of $2.50 to $2.55 per share because of better than expected 2007 results, as well as the benefit from changing our inventory valuation from LIFO to the average cost method. This compares with $2.47 in 2007, which is adjusted for the various one-time items and the conversion from LIFO to the average cost method.", "While we don\u2019t provide quarterly earnings guidance, I should point out that we are planning for relatively and consistently strong international sales growth throughout the year in Asia-Pacific outside Japan, in Europe, and in Canada and Latin America, along with solid growth of wholesale sales in the Middle East and Russia. However, we are forecasting softness in the U.S. sales for the first half of the year which in turn should lead everyone to expect pressure on earnings in the first and second quarters before rebounding later in the year.", "From a financial and infrastructure standpoint, Tiffany is prepared to grow its business and deal appropriately with whatever environment we encounter. I\u2019m now pleased to turn the call over to Mike.", "Michael J. Kowalski", "Thanks, Jim and good morning to all of you. As Mark and Jim have reviewed with you, 2007 was an active, productive, and highly profitable year for Tiffany. Despite the slowdown in our U.S. business in the latter part of the year, our international business in total performed very well, highlighting the benefit of our global diversification.", "We are now more than halfway through the first quarter and in today\u2019s press release, we indicated continued strong sales growth in non-U.S. markets except Japan, as well as slightly positive comparable store sales growth in the United States versus our expectation for a slight decline in the first half of 2008. It\u2019s obviously early in the year but we are pleased that worldwide sales are exceeding 10% in the quarter to date.", "We are all aware of the current economic uncertainties influencing consumers in the U.S. As we manage through these uncertain times, we will control our expenses prudently but at the same time capitalize on the numerous expansion opportunities available to us, increasing Tiffany's share of the large and still competitively fragmented jewelry industry.", "We plan to open six new stores in the U.S. this year, including the first of our new 2000 square foot format stores in the Los Angeles market. We believe the design of this exciting smaller store format will provide a retail selling and service environment that further enhances Tiffany's appeal to the self-purchase customer and it should allow us to broaden our store expansion plans and profitably reach more customers in the United States.", "Internationally, we expect to open approximately 20 locations this year. In Europe, we have long desired a presence in Spain and we will open a store at a prime location in Madrid, and we look forward to entering Belgium with a store in Brussels. We are also planning to add a fourth store in Germany when we open in D\u00fcsseldorf and we recently added our sixth location in London with a new store in terminal five at Heathrow Airport.", "We also have many exciting plans in Asia, including opening several locations in China. We\u2019ve announced a store for Perth, which will be our fourth location in the very successful Australian market. We are also opening several boutiques and department stores in Japan, including a couple of Tiffany for Men boutiques, and we will be undertaking a significant renovation this year of our Tokyo flagship store on the Ginza, which should be completed before the holiday season.", "Regarding individual product categories, 2007 was another terrific year for diamond sales and we continue to achieve great success in the engagement jewelry category. We also continue to broaden our overall jewelry offerings with designs that complement that perennial favorites of Tiffany.", "As always, our product development team has a substantial number of exciting new designs in the works for 2008.", "We are also very enthusiastic about our strategic alliance with The Swatch Group, which is the world\u2019s leading designer, developer, distributor and manufacturer of high-end luxury watches.", "While 2008 is a start-up and transition year, Swatch will begin to manufacture our watches to expand wholesale distribution to independent watch retailers and to develop the marketing support that is needed to build customer awareness.", "We are also working on new watch designs that will debut in 2009. We believe this alliance can ultimately lead to a watch business of very substantial scale in sales and in earnings.", "And we recently announced that Tiffany will open a Patek Philippe Salon on the mezzanine level of our New York flagship store. Tiffany's relationship with Patek Philippe dates back more than 150 years. We are honored to be chosen for their only salon in the United States.", "In closing, let me state what we believe is obvious but that nevertheless always bears repeating -- the Tiffany & Company brand remains remarkably strong in the United States and increasingly around the world. In fact, we believe our brand character is especially resonant in these most challenging of economic times when the future is obscured by so much uncertainty and pessimism.", "What has made Tiffany such an extraordinarily endearing brand is that our customers trust us to create those special objects that transcend time, even difficult times like those we confront today. Objects that are cherished, passed from one generation to the next. Objects that inspire, that matter, and that last. Those are the things that are of special importance today and there is little doubt in our mind that managing the Tiffany & Company brand to sustain and enhance that special character remains even more critically important today and remains the key to sustainable long-term financial growth and rewarding our shareholders.", "We will update you on our progress when we report Tiffany's first quarter results on Friday, May 30th. That concludes today\u2019s conference call. Please contact Mark with any questions. Again, thank you all for listening.", "Operator", "Thank you, everyone, for joining us for today\u2019s Tiffany & Company fourth quarter earnings conference call.

(NYSE:TIF) F2Q08 Earnings Call August 28, 2008  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Mark L. Aaron - Vice President, Investor Relations", "James N. Fernandez - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President", "Operator", "Good day, everyone and welcome to this Tiffany & Company second quarter earnings conference call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. Participating on today\u2019s call is the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mark Aaron; and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. James Fernandez. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark L. Aaron", "Thanks and greetings to everyone. Tiffany had a good second quarter and on this call, Jim and I will review those results and also comment on our outlook. We hope that by now you\u2019ve had a chance to read the press release we issued earlier this morning.", "Before continuing, please note Tiffany's Safe Harbor statement, that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's 2007 report on Form 10-K, and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Now let\u2019s proceed.", "Tiffany's results this year have been better than expected, despite dealing with challenging U.S. economic conditions and difficult year-over-year comparisons in some markets. In the second quarter, we continued to experience sales strength in many markets around the world, while not surprisingly our business in the U.S. was soft. The operating margin rose due to an improvement in gross margin, net earnings from continuing operations rose 21%, and because we reduced our share count due to substantial repurchases over the past year, EPS from continuing operations rose 31%.", "Before looking at performance on the top line among our various geographical segments, we want to remind you that we began new geographical segment reporting with first quarter results. For your information, we\u2019ve posted prior year sales results on our website at investor.tiffany.com, under the tabs financial information and reportable segments.", "Now let\u2019s review the details of our sales results. Starting with the Americas region, sales increased 3% in the second quarter, which was on top of a huge 19% increase last year. The 3% growth was due to an increase in the average price per unit sold, while the number of transactions was somewhat lower than last year.", "Our price stratification analysis in the U.S. showed softness at the two extremes of the price spectrum. While we continued to see a decline in sales and transactions below $500, we also some softness in sales above $50,000, and there were mixed results in other price strata.", "Comparable U.S. store sales declined 4% in the quarter, which was close to our slightly negative expectation but was on top of a huge 17% comp increase last year. On a monthly basis, U.S. comps declined 2% in May, 6% in June, and 5% in July. Keep in mind that in last year\u2019s second quarter, U.S. comps had surged 20% in May, 10% in June, and 22% in July, so while the year-over-year comparisons were quite challenging, the two-year run-rates were generally strong.", "That comparison will still be tough in the third quarter because U.S. comps rose 8% in last year\u2019s third quarter, but the comparison will get substantially easier in the fourth quarter when we go up against a 1% decline last year. As we\u2019ve said in the past, we do not draw conclusions from month-to-month fluctuations.", "Looking at results geographically, comparable U.S. brand store sales declined 6% in the quarter, which compared with a 14% increase last year. The softness was generally spread around the country, although several stores with strong increases included Edina, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Denver, and some Texas stores. Not surprisingly, business was soft in Southern California but we were pleased to see our stores in Florida holding their own, with sales actually equal to last year. Sales were soft in Las Vegas, where tourism has softened, while on the other hand, our business in Hawaii increased as it benefited from growing sales to Japanese tourists.", "Sales in our New York flagship store increased 5% in the quarter, on top of an enormous 31% increase last year due to higher spending by non-U.S. visitors, while sales to New Yorkers were below last year, which should not be too surprising to anyone. In fact, the 2% increase in total U.S. store sales was also more than entirely due to higher spending by customers from other countries.", "It\u2019s worth noting that while our U.S. sales growth continues to benefit from a strong influx of non-U.S. visitors, especially from Europe, we are simultaneously seeing strong sales growth within Europe, as I\u2019ll address in a moment.", "While the New York flagship store increased 5% in the quarter, total sales in the nine-store New York region increased 7%, as lower sales in most suburban stores were more than offset by the incremental sales from our new Wall Street store, which is not yet in the comp base. In fact, we continue to be very pleased with results in that store, which opened last October. That\u2019s pretty remarkable performance considering the current state of the financial services industry but it points to the need that existed for a Tiffany store in downtown Manhattan to serve large numbers of new customers as well as provide greater convenience to some existing customers.", "We are pleased with the performance of the other new stores we\u2019ve opened during the past year, again considering the economic circumstances, and we have several new stores opening in the coming months.", "Also within the Americas, combined e-commerce and catalog sales declined 4% in the quarter. That compared with a 12% increase in last year\u2019s second quarter and was below our expectation that had called for a modest increase. The 4% decline reflected fewer orders shipped, which more than offset an increase in the average order size.", "Catalog circulation declined modestly in the second quarter, which is in line with our full year expectation as we continue to focus on more effective targeted mailing.", "It is understandable that consumers are generally spending more cautiously at the moment but we are encouraged with some recent consumer confidence reports that may be indicating stabilization in confidence, albeit at low levels.", "Rounding out the Americas, we continued to achieve very strong sales growth in Canada through our stores in Toronto and Vancouver, along with a doubling of our Canadian e-commerce sales. We are also pleased with sales growth and development of our stores in Mexico and Brazil.", "Now let\u2019s turn away from the Americas and look at our performance in other regions. You should first note that our sales growth in dollars continues to benefit from the translation effects of foreign currencies that are stronger than the U.S. dollar. For example, Asia-Pacific region sales rose 7% on a constant exchange rate basis and rose 17% when translated into dollars, while European sales rose 29% in constant currencies and 35% in dollars. I\u2019ll refer to sales on the constant exchange rate basis in my following remarks.", "In the Asia-Pacific region, total sales rose 7% and comparable store sales rose 1%, reflecting growth in most markets that was partly offset by continued softness in Japan. Total sales in local currency in Japan declined 3% in the quarter, as a modest increase in jewelry units sold was more than offset by a decline in the average price per unit. Comp store sales declined 7%, which was below our expectations and compared with last year when comps had declined 6% in the quarter. Comps declined in each month of the quarter and there was no meaningful pattern, although comps in Tokyo were somewhat softer than outside Tokyo.", "We\u2019ve opened four new boutiques in Japan this year and we are pleased with customer reaction to our new Tiffany for Men boutique concept, and we are now participating in private selling events with the Gaisho sales professionals and their VIP clients at virtually all of our department store locations.", "Lastly, our Tokyo flagship store is in the midst of a major interior and fa\u00e7ade renovation that will undoubtedly generate plenty of customer and media interest when completed later this year. Until then, that store is open but its results are being significantly affected by the construction and the store will actually be closed from late September through October, but a newly opened department store boutique nearby is picking up some of the business.", "In the rest of the Asia-Pacific region, total sales on a constant exchange rate basis rose 18% in the quarter, driven by a large increase in jewelry units sold. Comps rose 13% with double-digit growth in all three months. This was in line with our expectation and came on top of a huge 24% comp increase last year. Growth was led by increases in Korea, Australia, and Mainland China.", "So far this year, we\u2019ve opened three stores in China as well as a new store in Perth, Australia, and have relocated boutiques in Malaysia and Korea. Several more are planned for later this year.", "Tiffany's in Europe also remained very strong in the second quarter, with a 29% total local currency sales increase that was ahead of our expectations with double-digit increases in most markets. Growth was driven by a large increase in jewelry units sold. Comparable store sales increased 11%, which was on top of a 23% increase last year, and growth was strong throughout the quarter.", "We currently operate 19 stores in Europe, with six stores in London accounting for slightly more than half of European sales, so we are especially pleased that our business in London remained strong in the quarter and ahead of expectations despite adverse economic reports.", "And we should add that the vast majority of our sales in London are made to local customers, as well as through our successful business on the Internet that reaches customers throughout the U.K.", "We are actively expanding Tiffany's store base in Europe this year and have already added locations in London at Heathrow\u2019s Terminal Five and in Brussels, with several additional European stores planned for other markets in the coming months. And we are pleased with our small but growing businesses in Russia and the Middle East through a network of independently operated Tiffany stores.", "Rounding out the sales review is our other channel, which posted a 37% sales increase in the quarter, mostly due to increased wholesale sales of rough diamonds acquired through our diamond sourcing program. As most of you know, those wholesale sales typically carry a zero gross margin, so an increase in those sales reduced our total gross margin.", "In this channel, we also have our Iridesse business, which posted a modest sales increase in the quarter and we are now recording license revenues from our eyewear agreement with Luxottica, which commenced distribution late last year. We expect other sales for the year to be approximately unchanged from the prior year.", "That wraps up the sales review by geographical segment. From a merchandising perspective in the quarter, diamonds continued to be the main attraction, including strength in engagement rings, studs, pendants, and diamonds by the yard. In fact, we had double-digit percentage growth in the engagement jewelry category due to strength in diamond solitaires and band rings with the strongest growth in Asia-Pacific and Europe.", "Statement jewelry sales, however, were down slightly due to the softness at the high-end in the U.S. that we already mentioned. At the other price extreme, sales around the world rose very nicely in our fashion jewelry category, which reflected the success of our silver and gold charms program, and designer jewelry rose modestly on a worldwide basis.", "So while sales growth was mixed among the different categories and price points due to varying economic conditions, the core attraction of the Tiffany & Company brand ranges from the classics to newer designs. The new summer set and Tiffany Notes jewelry collections are doing well, as are the expanded legacy, swing, and Victoria collections. And we are excited about the potential for the newly launched metro collection, as well as recent additions to the 1837 and Atlas collection. And our celebration ring campaign definitely continues to resonate with customers.", "To support our products, we are now launching a dramatic new advertising campaign that will be appearing in all of our touch points, including magazines, newspapers, online, catalogs, and outdoor ads. We think the ads will help to generate plenty of excitement and awareness among customers as we head toward the all-important holiday selling season.", "So that now wraps up the sales review. Looking at the rest of the income statement, gross margin of 57.8% in the second quarter was higher than the 56.1% last year and also above our expectation, due to favorable moves in geographic and product sales mix, as well as sales leverage on the fixed costs that are in cost of sales.", "Precious metal costs are higher than at this time a year ago, with both platinum and silver up approximately 15%. In addition, we\u2019ve been seeing overall low double-digit percentage increases in polished diamond costs, with the largest cost increases among the bigger stones. However, we\u2019ve selectively increased retail prices to address these rising costs.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 13% in the quarter, which was virtually in line with our expectations due to increased labor and occupancy costs related to new stores, along with higher marketing expenses. In addition, about a quarter of that 13% increase was simply due to the translation effect from stronger foreign currencies. The ratio of SG&A expenses to sales increased to 39.8% from 39.1% last year, due to insufficient sales leverage.", "Other expenses net of $3.3 million was marginally higher than last year and the effective tax rate of 37% was in line with our forecast and compared with 39.4% last year.", "So adding it all up, net earnings from continuing operations increased 21% to $80.8 million, or $0.63 per diluted share in the second quarter, which surpassed our expectation. Pretty good performance considering the currently tough environment, as well as the comparison to a strong quarter last year when net earnings from continuing operations had increased 29%.", "Below that line, you should note that last year\u2019s second quarter results included an after tax charge in discontinued operations of $24 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, related to our sale of the Little Switzerland business.", "Lastly, we\u2019ve made a number of references on this call to stronger foreign currencies. We thought you might be interested to know that the benefit to EPS from the translation of stronger foreign currencies into U.S. dollars was a modest $0.02 per share in the quarter and $0.04 per share in the first half.", "I\u2019m now pleased to turn the call over to Jim.", "James N. Fernandez", "Thanks, Mark. Yes, we are pleased with our overall second quarter results and considering the various external challenges and uncertainties facing retailers and consumers, we feel Tiffany is more than holding its own and considering the degree of promotional activity in the U.S., we think that our sales performance especially demonstrates the strong attraction and appeal of the Tiffany & Company brand and our products.", "In addition, we think most of you will agree with the benefits of Tiffany's geographical diversification as we establish and maintain relationships with customers who shop in a Tiffany store in their home country or shop when they are traveling. And the global footprint helps us to achieve overall success when temporarily soft results in some markets are counter-balanced by strength elsewhere, as we\u2019ve demonstrated in the past few quarters.", "At the end of the second quarter, we operated 196 Tiffany & Company stores in 19 countries, including 82 in the Americas, 95 in Asia-Pacific, and 19 in Europe. The current economic conditions do not deter us from pursuing substantial store expansion opportunities. In fact, this year we are growing our global store base at an above average pace. In the U.S., we\u2019ve already stores that are performing well in the markets of Topanga and Los Angeles and in West Hartford, and are on track to open stores in Pittsburgh and Columbus in the coming months, as well as to soon convert a temporary location in the Mohican Sun Resort in Connecticut to a full line store.", "We are also very excited about the potential of our new 2,000 square foot retail store concept which we will debut in Glendale, California in October, offering a wide selection of Tiffany's designs with the exception of engagement and high-end statement jewelry.", "Outside the U.S., we have accelerated the rate of store openings, including 11 in Asia-Pacific, which includes a stepped-up pace of expansion in China, and seven stores in Europe, which includes opening our first stores in Belgium, Ireland, and Spain. In total, we are growing our worldwide store base approximately 13% this year and we will soon be launching e-commerce in Australia.", "Tiffany's well-developed infrastructure and manufacturing, product sourcing and distribution is effectively supporting the growth of our existing business and our store expansion. We have the balance sheet strength to not only weather the adverse effects from short-term business cycles but to thrive by increasing our market share against local competitors, and we are taking advantage of adverse stock market conditions by actively repurchasing our shares.", "Looking briefly at the July 31st balance sheet, net inventories at the end of the quarter were 10% higher than a year ago. Part of the increase was, of course, necessary for store expansion and expanded internal manufacturing necessitated an increase in raw material and work-in-process inventories. Lastly, approximately one-fifth of the increase was due to the effect of translating foreign inventories into U.S. dollars.", "Accounts receivable at July 31st were 19% higher than a year ago, with much of the increase tied to sales growth, as well as some related to expanded international wholesale distribution and a portion due to the effect of translation.", "Lastly, as our stock price softened during the quarter with the overall market, we stepped up our pace of share repurchases. In total, we spent $74 million to repurchase 1.7 million shares at an average cost of $42.75 per share. That still left us with $492 million of remaining authorization in the current program.", "Adding it all up, total debt as a percentage of stockholders\u2019 equity was 36% at quarter\u2019s end, compared with 27% a year ago.", "Profitability and asset efficiency continue to improve. Tiffany's 12% return on average assets in the quarter was above our 10% long-term objective, and our 20% return on average stockholders\u2019 equity was well above our 15% long-term objective.", "Now let\u2019s conclude with our current outlook for the rest of the year. We expect total sales growth of approximately 9% for the year, which assumes sales growth in dollars of mid-single-digits in the Americas, low-double-digits in Asia-Pacific, and more than 25% growth in Europe. Built into those expectations for the Americas, we are now looking for full-year U.S. comparable store sales, as well as combined e-commerce and catalog sales, to be equal to last year.", "While we do not claim to have knowledge about where the economy will be later this year, our U.S. assumption is based on a substantially easier year-over-year comparison in the fourth quarter. We have moderated the growth expectation from our last forecast but still believe that a modest increase in U.S. comp store sales in the fourth quarter is a reasonable assumption. We are also assuming comp increases on a constant exchange rate basis that include a low teens increase in Asia-Pacific stores outside Japan, a negative mid-single-digit comp in Japan, and a low-double-digit increase in Europe, and we base those growth assumptions on our potential to steadily increase Tiffany's market share.", "Our full year expectations now call for the operating margin to increase slightly, which would include an increase in gross margin, partly offset by some increase in the SG&A expense ratio. We expect other expenses net to be in the area of approximately $17 million and we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 37% for the year.", "Therefore, our first half performance and most recent trends lead us to project earnings per diluted share in a range of $2.82 to $2.92 for the year, which is slightly higher than our previous $2.80 to $2.90 forecast. That compares with $2.47 per share in fiscal 2007, as adjusted for various one-time items and our change in inventory accounting.", "While our second quarter results substantially beat expectations, we are only slightly raising our full-year forecast as a result of our more moderate second half expectations for sales in the U.S. and Japan. Tiffany's longer term growth objectives continue to call for low-double-digit sales growth and mid-teens earnings growth, so we believe that achieving this current forecast in this environment is a clear indication of Tiffany's earnings power.", "That concludes today\u2019s call. Please feel free to call Mark with any questions and please note that we expect to report Tiffany's third quarter results on Wednesday, November 26th, and thanks for listening.", "Operator", "And that concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Fernandez - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President", "Operator", "Good day, everyone and welcome to this Tiffany & Company third quarter earnings conference call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. Participating on today\u2019s call is the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mark Aaron and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. James Fernandez.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark Aaron", "Thanks you. Good morning. It was a tough third quarter in terms of sales for well known reasons but our bottom line held up well. Jim and I will review Tiffany's performance and also comment on our outlook for the remainder of the year. We hope you have already had a chance to read today\u2019s press release.", "Before continuing, please note Tiffany's Safe Harbor statement that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's 2007 report on Form 10K and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Now let\u2019s proceed.", "After a solid first half of the year where sales and earnings growth surpassed expectations, as well as a good start to the third quarter, Tiffany's then faced a host of external challenges as the economy slowed, the credit markets froze and the equity markets tumbled. All of this dramatically affected consumer confidence and led to a further pull back in spending in the U.S. as well as initial softening in some of our non-U.S. markets.", "As a result worldwide net sales in the third quarter were 1% below the prior year. Excluding the translation effect from stronger foreign currencies, sales declined 2% in the quarter. Net earnings from continuing operations were below last year but keep in mind we recorded a large gain last year related to the sale of our Tokyo flagship store building. Excluding that gain and a related contribution to the Tiffany & Co. Foundation, net earnings from continuing operations were higher than last year. You can refer to a non-GAAP analysis that is attached to today\u2019s press release for further clarification.", "So let\u2019s look at sales results starting with the Americas region. Sales declined 7% in the third quarter. This was due to a 14% decline in comparable U.S. store sales which was below our expectation that called for only a modest decline and compared with a healthy 8% increase last year. The comp store sales trend ranged from a 6% decline in August, as expected, versus an 11% increase last year to much greater than expected declines of 15% in September versus a 2% prior increase and a comp decline of 20% in October versus a 12% increase last year.", "U.S. comps have softened further in November. Geographically, sales in the New York flagship store declined 5% in the quarter and its low point was in October when sales in that store declined 17%. Total sales in the entire nine store New York region declined 6% in the quarter which includes the Wall Street store.", "You may be interested to know that while our New York flagship store generated more than 20% of our U.S. store sales in the quarter the eight other New York area stores add up to slightly less than half of the flagship store\u2019s volume.", "Outside of the New York flagship store, our comparable U.S. branch store sales declined 16% in the quarter with the low point in October when total branch store comps declined 21%. The sales decline in the Americas resulted from substantial decreases in the number of transactions in every region of the U.S. except for the New York flagship store where it declined just slightly. While the average size per transaction rose slightly across the U.S. Our price stratification analysis showed weakness in sales and transactions across the board at most price levels with no meaningful differences.", "Having said that we want to point out there is still plenty of sales activity occurring at high price points and our Blue Book event in New York in October confirmed ongoing interest among our customers. While the year-over-year comparison is down there are most assuredly still a significant number of high end purchases.", "In terms of the customer base in the quarter the comp store sales declined entirely reflective lower sales to lower market customers. While sales to foreign tourists, especially from Europe, rose slightly with that increase occurring in the New York flagship store.", "Notwithstanding the current environment, we have seen an enthusiastic response from customers to the new stores we have opened this year. In Topanga Canyon in the L.A. market, in West Hartford in Pittsburgh and in Columbus. We also recently completed the conversion of our location in the Mohegan Sun resort in Connecticut into a regular store. We were pleased with the initial reaction to our new smaller store concept we opened last month in Glendale, California.", "Feedback suggests we were successful in creating an exciting new format for the self-purchase fashion customer. Also in the Americas region combined e-commerce and catalog sales in the U.S. declined 7% in the quarter with a decline in orders partly offset by an increase in the average order size. As intended we reduced catalog mailings in the quarter to focus on more email marketing and online search but circulation will again increase in the fourth quarter.", "We were also periodically offering complimentary shipping on our website and will repeat it in the fourth quarter at a frequency consistent with last year. Our website and catalogs continue to represent important sales and marketing vehicles as they complement our retail stores and our overall multi-channel distribution model. I should add that business gift sales actually rose slightly in the quarter despite the environment.", "Rounding out the Americas, our retail sales in Canada, Mexico and Brazil were up by double digit percentages in the quarter and e-commerce sales in Canada were strong too.", "Now turning to the Asia Pacific region, sales rose 3% in the third quarter due to an increase in the average price per unit sold. Unit growth in the region was hampered by a decline in Japan. On a constant exchange rate basis, sales declined 1% and comps declined 3%. Japan represents just over half of that region and total sales in dollars rose 1% but declined 8% in Yen. Local currency comps in Japan declined 7% which was below our expectation and compared with a 1% decline in last year\u2019s third quarter.", "Comps in Japan began the quarter with a modest increase but then turned down in September and October. Last year comps varied in a pretty narrow range during the quarter. In addition, sales performance within and outside Tokyo was not meaningfully different in the quarter.", "We have added four new boutiques in 2008 in the Daimaru Department store in Fukuoka, in the Hankyu store in Umeda, in the Matsuzakaya store in Tokyo and the Intetsu Store in Hamamatsu. Our flagship store on Nigenza in Tokyo, which was closed for the final stages of renovation in late September and October re-opened on November 1 to great media fanfare.", "In the Asia Pacific region outside Japan total sales in constant currency rose 12% and comp store sales rose 4% which was on top of a huge 29% increase last year. We saw strength in most countries except Hong Kong where we believe a spending decline is at least somewhat tied to their heavy exposure to the financial services industry. On the other hand, markets such as Australia and Korea were strong in the quarter and we are very pleased with our business in China where we have eight stores on the mainland and two stores in Macao. The comp store sales trend for this region softened during the quarter due to the sales softening in Hong Kong.", "During 2008 we have expanded our presence in China with three additional stores in Shenyang, Chengdu and Qingdao. We have broadened our successful business in Australia with a store in Perth. We have added two stores in Korea and closed an older one. We relocated a store in Malaysia. We were also pleased to launch our e-commerce website in Australia in September.", "Now turning to Europe. Total sales rose 16% due to an increase in the number of units sold. Total sales on a constant exchange rate basis rose by an even stronger 24%. On that basis, comp store sales increased 8% which was on top of a 14% increase last year. Comps rose in all three months of the quarter. London represents a bit more than half of European sales and despite the various economic and market pressures it posted double digit sales growth that continued throughout the quarter.", "In the U.K. we are also seeing strength in e-commerce and catalog sales. Retail store sales also rose in every country on the continent. This has been an unusually active year for Tiffany\u2019s store expansion in Europe with seven new stores opened including two in London, one each in Brussels, Madrid, Dublin, D\u00fcsseldorf and Berlin. We are pleased with their initial results and especially with their potential to strengthen our European presence and increase Tiffany's market share.", "So that rounds out our sales in the three geographical regions. Lastly sales in Tiffany's other channels declined 1% in the quarter on top of 137% increase last year which had been due to increased wholesale sales of diamonds in connection with our rough diamond sourcing. In addition, sales in our iridesced pearl jewelry stores declined and were below expectations.", "From a merchandising perspective there obviously weren\u2019t an abundance of positives to highlight in the quarter but I do still want to comment on our key categories. First, while overall statement jewelry sales declined in the quarter they rose slightly outside the U.S. Similarly, sales of our various fine jewelry collections declined modestly worldwide with a greater drop in the U.S. but increased nicely elsewhere especially in the Asia Pacific region. A single digit increase in worldwide engagement jewelry sales included a small decline in the U.S. in diamond solitaire sales but strong growth in wedding bands.", "While outside the U.S. engagement sales were broadly up across the category. At more modest price points, fashion jewelry sales were up in the quarter due to the continued success of our silver and gold charm jewelry collection with particular strength in Europe. The designer jewelry category was down in the quarter with pronounced softness in the U.S.", "Lastly, despite softness in watch sales we are excited about progress being made in our strategic alliance with the Swatch group which will result in the launch of new designs and greatly expanded distribution in 2009.", "Now let\u2019s turn to the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin rose almost 2 points to 66.3% in the third quarter due to favorable changes in product sales mix, the benefit from the company\u2019s precious metal hedging program and a reduction in anticipated management incentive compensation. We all know that it is currently a very promotional environment and it is important to note that Tiffany's opposition to engaging in such promotion helps to maintain brand integrity and also ensures gross margin stability.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 7% in the quarter as a reduction in anticipated management incentive compensation more than offset incremental costs related to new stores. The translation effect from stronger foreign currencies was modest, increasing SG&A expenses by 1% in the quarter and 2% in the year-to-date.", "Keep in mind that last year\u2019s SG&A included a $10 million contribution to the Tiffany & Co. Foundation from the proceeds of the sale of our Tokyo flagship store building. Excluding that expense on an apples-to-apples basis the ratio of SG&A to sales improved by 8/10 of a point to 43.6% in the quarter. The operating margin was 12.7% in the third quarter. Last year excluding the $105 million pre-tax gain on the sale of the Tokyo store building and the $10 million Foundation contribution, the operating margin was 10.1%. So you can see that despite the sales softness we were able to hold our own from a margin perspective.", "Other expenses net were $14 million in the quarter versus $2 million last year. One meaningful part of the increase resulted from the total write off of an interest rate swap we held with Lehman Brothers. Another portion of the increase came from foreign exchange transaction losses. To a lesser extent interest expense was higher and interest income was lower.", "Tiffany's effective tax rate was 31.7% in the quarter versus 33.9% last year. In total, net earnings from continuing operations in the third quarter were $44 million or $0.35 per diluted share. Last year\u2019s net earnings from continuing operations in the third quarter were $103 million or $0.74 per diluted share but adjusting for the gain on the Tokyo building and the foundation contribution it was $0.31 per share on a continuing operations basis or $0.29 per share of net income.", "So we maintained a high level of profitability despite the current environment. Related to that our return on average stockholder\u2019s equity was 17% and return on average assets was 10% which compared with our long-term objectives of at least 15% for ROE and at least 10% for ROA.", "I am now pleased to turn the call over to Jim.", "James Fernandez", "Thanks Mark. The third quarter certainly posed obvious challenges for Tiffany and the entire retail industry. Having said that we believe the Tiffany & Co. brand is stronger than ever and that such an attribute will help our company to out perform others and thrive over the long-term.", "As you know, we operate in a competitively fragmented industry and it is likely that more than a few of those competitors are struggling as indicated by their high levels of price promotions. We have the financial strength to achieve our objective of increased market share. Tiffany's balance sheet at October 31 including cash and cash equivalents of $160 million, total short and long-term debt of $821 million and stockholder\u2019s equity of $1.6 billion. Accounts receivable at October 31 were 3% lower than a year ago due to sales performance but receivable turnover remained at a very high 18 times per year.", "Net inventories at October 31 were 12% above last year. The increase was directly related to the sudden softening of sales in September and October but also partly due to higher raw materials related to higher manufacturing and diamond sourcing as well as for new stores. The translation effect on inventories was not significant.", "Tiffany's inventories are in good shape. It is important to keep in mind that unlike many other retailers our inventory is not seasonal in nature and does not go out of style. However, we will adjust purchase orders with outside vendors and will modify internal manufacturing levels to adjust to the near-term reductions in our sales expectations.", "In terms of share repurchases, we were active early in the third quarter and spent $90 million to repurchase 2.3 million shares at what we thought was the very attractive average cost of $39.61 per share. However, as market turmoil and near-term uncertainties about business conditions increased we temporarily suspended our buying to conserve cash. Total debt to equity is typically near its seasonal high at October 31. The ratio is 50% at October 31 versus 23% a year ago, largely reflecting a smaller equity base tied to substantial share repurchases over the past year as well as higher short-term borrowings.", "In fact, over the past four quarters Tiffany has spent $37 million to repurchase and retire 14.7 million shares of its common stock. Related to that we have disclosed in our second quarter report on form 10Q that we were evaluating opportunities to issue new debt, up to $300 million in order to repay $100 million of senior notes coming due within the next 12 months as well as to fund potential share repurchases. The credit market then froze and potential lenders postponed making commitments. Due to the credit market conditions we have secured some short-term financing arrangements to see us through our seasonal peak needs.", "When appropriate, we will either refinance or replace these borrowings with long-term debt. In addition you should note that on our $450 million revolving credit facility we had $339 million outstanding at October 31 so there was still $111 million available.", "Now let\u2019s talk about our expectations for the remainder of the year. The environment is obviously filled with uncertainties about how customers will be spending in the coming weeks. Our stores are well stocked to serve our customers with a range of products and prices including many new exciting designs introduced this year to entice our customers. Our stores are appropriate staffed to deliver the outstanding shopping experience that everyone expects at Tiffany. Our distribution centers are operating very efficiently to ensure that products are shipped and delivered in a timely fashion.", "We mentioned in today\u2019s press release that U.S. sales in November to date have softened further from the decline we saw in October. So we are forecasting conservatively. In our judgment for the fourth quarter by expecting U.S. comp store sales to decline 25-35% which will be up against a 1% comp decline in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. At the same time we are also taking a conservative position by forecasting relatively challenging conditions to one degree or another in Europe and Asia Pacific. Combined with the six stores we have opened this year in the U.S., seven stores in Europe and a net of nine stores in the Asia Pacific region we are looking for worldwide sales to decline 13-20% in the fourth quarter.", "This would result in sales for the year coming in somewhere between a 2% decline to unchanged from 2007. Gross margin is holding up nicely and should be up for the year which of course reflects the non-promotional nature of our company. I\u2019ll add that we have seen recent declines in precious metal and diamond costs which if they continue should ease pressure on our product input costs later in 2009 but it is too early to forecast that.", "Tiffany's expense ratio will undoubtedly increase for the year as sales shortfalls result in de-leveraging of fixed costs. As such we are now forecasting the operating margin in a range of 17-18% for the full year. We estimate that other expenses net will be approximately $25-27 million for the year and we are planning the effective tax rate at approximately 36%.", "As a result we are reducing our full-year earnings projection from $2.82 to $2.92 per diluted share to a new and somewhat wider range of $2.30 to $2.50 per share. There are obviously an infinite number of potential scenarios for sales performance by geographical market as well as the related margin implications but we think we are considering a reasonable range of fourth quarter sales outcomes.", "Finally, our new range compares with net earnings of $2.20 in 2007 and an adjusted 2007 base level of $2.47 which excludes certain items last year. We are still in the very early stages of constructing our plans for 2009 but we will plan conservatively in our sales growth assumptions. I can also share with you we will adjust staffing levels and capital expenditures in order to most effectively allocate our resources in this environment.", "Our new 2008 full year guidance does not include any fourth quarter one-time charge for staff reductions. We will continue to expand our store base, but have decided to slow the rate of growth and the number of locations from the longer term 8-10% annual rate to approximately 5-6% in 2009 by pursuing the most compelling location opportunities and focusing more on expansion outside the U.S.", "This will probably mean opening about five stores in the Americas, across the U.S., Canada and Latin America and about eight stores across Asia Pacific and Europe in 2009.", "In closing, the 2008 holiday season is upon us and many customers will undoubtedly be seeking Tiffany's extraordinary products. Tiffany is a trusted American institution. We offer timeless design and craftsmanship that lasts. The Tiffany & Co. brand is worthy for celebrating important personal milestones, incorporating the established values of romance, love and honor. Our management team is prepared to address the short-term business challenges of the current environment so that our company prospers over the longer term.", "Please note that we expect to report sales results for the November/December period on Wednesday, January 14. Until then our best wishes to you for happiness during this holiday season. That concludes today\u2019s call and please feel free to call Mark with any questions. Thanks for listening.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference.

(NYSE:TIF) Q4 2008 Earnings Call March 23, 2009  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Mark Aaron - VP, IR", "Mike Kowalski - Chairman and CEO", "Jim Fernandez - CFO and EVP", "Operator", "Good day everyone and welcome to this Tiffany & Company Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today's call is Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mark Aaron and the Chairman and CEO, Mr. Mike Kowalski, and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Jim Fernandez.", "At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead sir.", "Mark Aaron", "Thank you. Good morning to everyone. Tiffany's fourth quarter and full-year results were issued earlier today and we hope that you had a chance to read the press release.", "On this call, Mike, Jim and I will comment on the results and on the business outlook for 2009. First, please note Tiffany's Safe Harbor statement, that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's 2007 report on Form 10-K and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Now let\u2019s proceed.", "As we said on our holiday sales call two months ago, the conclusion to 2008 was the most challenging in the 21 years since Tiffany became a public company. Consumers were bombarded with various external pressures that you are all well aware of. All of which not surprisingly took a toll on their spending and on Tiffany\u2019s sales results. However, we were pleased that margins came in slightly better than we had projected, so that earnings excluding one-time items for the quarter and year were above the forecast we published two months ago.", "Let's look at the details. Tiffany's world-wide net sales declined 20% in the fourth quarter. Excluding the effects from foreign currency translation, world-wide net sales declined 19% due to a 23% decline in comparable store sales that included extreme softness in the US and sluggish trends to one degree or another in other region.", "In the Americas, sales declined 29% in the quarter, which reflected difficult economic conditions in the US, but also likely reflected the impact from heavy price promoting by competitors. Total retail sales in the US declined 31% and comp store sales declined 33%. We now know that the US recession officially began in late 2007, which coincided with a 1% decline in our US comps in the fourth quarter of that year.", "On a monthly basis in this fourth quarter, US comps declined 39% in November, 33% in December and 23% in January. For the quarter, the softness was wide spread and consistent, with comps down 33% in branch stores, 35% in the nine store New York region and 34% in our New York flagship store.", "For the full-year, comp US branch store sales declined 17%. In the New York flagship store, which represents 10% of worldwide sales, we saw a 9% sales decline. But despite that, it generated very high sales productivity of about $6,500 per gross square foot for the full year.", "The ranking of our five largest US brand stores in terms of sales volume in 2008 was South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, again the largest, followed by our stores in Chicago, San Francisco, Beverly Hills and our Washington, D.C, store in Vienna, Virginia.", "Most of the US sales decline in the quarter came from a decrease in a number of transactions, but the remainder coming from customers spending less per transaction. Just as an aside, the 16% US comp decline for the full year resulted almost entirely from fewer transactions.", "In terms of how sales and transactions were stratified in the US, there were declines in every price strata in the quarter. But the declines were somewhat smaller in the sales below $500 and larger in the sales above $50,000.", "From a customer mix perspective, local customers always generate a vast majority of our US business. And sales to those customers, obviously, declined in the quarter. But we also saw similar percentage declines in the sales to tourists visiting New York and around the country.", "Overall for the full year, sales in the US made to foreign tourists represented 16% of US store sales in 2008, versus 14% in 2007 and 11% in 2006. The economic climate also affects new store performance, but despite that, we are encouraged with the results of the new stores that we opened in 2008, which included West Hartford, Columbus, Pittsburgh, Topanga Canyon in LA and in the Mohegan Sun resort in Connecticut. And customers seem to appreciate our new smaller format store in Glendale, California, although the economy is having an effect on its results there too.", "Despite the tough environment though, we are pleased that the Glendale store is generating high levels of profitability relative to other new US stores. We finished the year with 76 stores in the US.", "Also in the US, tiffany.com and our catalogs generate substantial sales volume and also support our marketing communications. Internet and catalog sales declined 20% on a combined basis in the quarter due to a lower number of orders shipped, while the average order size held steady.", "For the full year, US Internet and catalog sales accounted for 10% of the Americas sales and a decline in orders caused their sales to drop 10%, while the average order size in the year rose slightly. We modestly reduced catalog mailings in 2008 and expect to reduce it further in 2009, as we continue to ship marketing resources in response to consumer behavior.", "Rounding out the Americas, we continued to experience healthy local currency sales growth in Canada in the quarter, including the strong ecommerce sales there, while sales were soft in Mexico and rose in Brazil. As a result of this performance, the Americas region accounted for 55% of total sales in 2008 versus 60% in 2007.", "Let's now turn to the Asia-Pacific region where total sales declined 3% in the quarter. However, on a constant exchange rate basis, sales declined 9% and comp store sales dropped 13%.", "Japan is our largest market in that region and total sales rose 4% in the quarter. However, excluding the effects of the stronger yen versus a dollar, sales declined 13% in total and comps declined 16%.", "This compared with a 6% comp decline last year, and sales declined in all three months. There were similar comp declines within Tokyo and outside Tokyo. For the full year, total sales in Japan in yen declined 7% and comps declined 10%.", "Japan actually increased as a percentage of total company sales to 19% in 2008 from 17% in 2007, that increase was entirely driven by the translation effect on sales from the stronger yen. In fact the yen averaged 102 to the dollar in 2008 versus a 117 in the prior year.", "We opened four department store boutiques in 2008 in Japan. In the Dimaru store in Fukuoka, and the Hankyu store in Umeda, in the Matsuzakaya store in Tokyo's Ginza, and in the Entetsu store in Hamamatsu. And we now operate 57 locations throughout Japan.", "In Asia-Pacific markets outside Japan, total sales represented 13% of worldwide sales in 2008 versus 12% in 2007. Local currency comps declined 9% in the quarter. We might want to know that they were comparing against a 28% increase in the fourth quarter of 2007. Sales in the quarter ranged from strength in Australia, China, and Korea to softness in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan.", "For the year, Asia-Pacific sales outside Japan rose 12% in constant currencies and comp store sales rose 5%. We added a net of five new stores in those markets in 2008, including three in China in Shenyang, Chengdu and Qingdao as well as new locations in Korea, Australia and a relocation in Malaysia.", "Now let's turn to Europe. Total sales in dollars declined 2% in the fourth quarter due to the strengths of the dollar, but sales rose 20% in local currencies due to incremental sales from new stores. Local currency comp store sales were equal to the prior year as our sales softened in the UK and their comps turned modestly negative. Conversely, our comps rose in most countries on the continent. Total European sales in constant currencies rose 25% in 2008 and comps rose 6%.", "We aggressively expanded Tiffany's European presence in 2008 by opening seven stores including two in London in Heathrow's Terminal 5 in West London, two in Germany in Berlin and D\u00fcsseldorf. And we entered three new countries with stores in Brussels, Dublin and Madrid. We now have 24 locations in Europe, and recently announced our plan to open a store in Amsterdam in 2009. Europe\u2019s share on the worldwide sales mix increased in 2008 growing to 10% of sales from 8% in 2007.", "In total, we expanded our worldwide store base with the opening of 22 Tiffany & Company operated stores and boutiques in 2008 and finished the year with 206 locations in 21 countries. This was a 12% increase in the number of location. Square footage rose 9% to approximately 935,000 gross square feet, including 600,000 in the Americas, 242,000 in the Asia-Pacific and 93,000 in Europe.", "Rounding out our top line results, sales in our other channel declined 71% in the quarter. This was due to lower wholesale sales of diamonds that partly reflected the timing of greater sales that were made earlier in the year as well as some recent reductions in purchases of rough diamond due to current business condition.", "And our IRIDESSE stores continued to perform below expectations. We are planning to close IRIDESSE as we reach agreements with our landlords and when we have sold off its inventory over the course of 2009. We decided to exit that business due to its operating losses and inadequate near-term growth prospects especially in this economic environment.", "We recorded a pre-tax charge of $7 million in the fourth quarter for this and other costs. But by eliminating its operating losses, this will benefit Tiffany's bottom line by a few cents a share annually after it is completely closed.", "I will wrap up my remarks with some merchandising highlights. The generally across the board softness and product sales that we described on the holiday sales conference call was not surprisingly true for the entire quarter, soft by category and by geography.", "As we have noted, high-end statement jewelry sales were lower around the world and down more than the overall company average, due to declines in both units and average price. Sales of fine jewelry collections were also down due to lower units and average price with more of that softness in the Americas. Despite the overall softness, however, customers appreciate new designs including the sophisticated and sleek Tiffany Metro collection. It is certainly safe to say that great designs, whether new or classic, will always resonate with customers, such as our Legacy Jewelry collection. And as our advertising campaign states, Tiffany Celebration Rings are suitable for the moments that matter.", "Engagement jewelry sales in the quarter declined less than the company average as we saw stronger sales of diamond engagement rings and wedding bands outside the Americas. In addition, sales in our silver and gold jewelry categories were also down in the quarter but less than the company average as we benefited from strong sales of Charm jewelry and other iconic designs such as our Atlas 1837 and Somerset Collection.", "And although, it is just being launched now in the first quarter, we are very excited about the significant potential of the new Tiffany Keys collection of pendants in a wide range that spans platinum and diamond, gold and silver. Keys are already in some of stores and a fewer of the skews are on our website. And you can expect to see substantial advertising and publicity for it in the coming month.", "Lastly, sales of watches were soft, but we are looking forward to a boost in watch sales as the Swatch Group begins to launch new designs and expanded distribution this year.", "I will now turn the call over to Jim.", "Jim Fernandez", "Thanks Mark. The fourth quarter and full-year performance we experienced were disappointing, but not surprising in light of the economic conditions in the US and certain other markets.", "The sales shortfall obviously affected our operating margin. Gross margin at 58.6% in the fourth quarter was up from 57.9% in the prior year. We recorded the charge in the fourth quarter for the write-down of inventory in our IRIDESSE business. Last year's fourth quarter included a watch obsolescence charge related to the start of our strategic alliance with the Swatch group.", "On an apples-to-apples basis, excluding those charges, gross margin in the fourth quarter would have declined four-tenths of a point, reflecting sales de-leverage on the fixed cost that are in cost to sales which are distribution centers, internal manufacturing and our merchandizing and diamond sourcing divisions. The sales de-leverage was partly offset by benefits from lower wholesale sales of diamonds and favorable product sales mix.", "While we believe our sales were negatively affected by the ramp in discounting of some other jewelers and high end competitors. We did and will continue with our full price philosophy in order to maintain appropriate margins and very importantly to maintain the integrity of the Tiffany and Company brand.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses declined 19% in the fourth quarter, and the decline was partly due to lower management incentive compensation and sales related variable cost savings. However, there were several one-time items distorting the year-over-year comparison. In this year's fourth quarter, SG&A expenses included the impairment charge for a loan to Target Resources, a diamond mining company, and a charge to close the diamond polishing facility in the Illinois, Canada and an IRIDESSE related charge.", "Last year's fourth quarter included an asset impairment charge for IRIDESSE and an impairment charge for a loan to Tahera Diamond Company. Excluding those current and prior year items, SG&A expenses would have declined 9% in the quarter.", "In order to maximize productivity, we recently closed our facility in Yellowknife, Canada and shifted their operations to other locations. We had opened the Yellowknife factory in 2003 to obtain rough diamonds from the new mines in the Northwest Territories and to establish closer ties with Canadian suppliers. However the high cost base of that operation and the lack of additional rough diamond supply opportunities in Canada prevented that operation from remaining viable.", "Despite these charges related to our diamond sourcing operations, we still strongly believe that it is important to maintain close relationships with mining companies that can support our long-term needs for sufficient high-quality diamond supply.", "Separately, we recorded a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter related to our offering and early retirement program and other staff reductions. As we previously announced, we offered an early retirement program to approximately 800 US employees and approximately 600 people elected to participate.", "We also selectively reduced staff levels to address the current and expected environment. Those actions as well as the anticipated closing of our IRIDESSE stores will result in a reduction of about 10% of our worldwide staffing.", "In the fourth quarter, we recorded a pre-tax one-time restructuring charge of $98 million of which more than half was non-cash. However, we anticipate realizing cost savings of approximately $60 million in 2009, which are incorporated into our expectations for gross margin and the SG&A expense ratio.", "Other expenses net, rose in the fourth quarter, primarily due to higher interest expense and lower interest income. Other expenses net increased in the year for similar reasons as well as from the $4 million write-off in the third quarter of an interest rate swap with Lehman Brothers and several million dollars of transactions losses associated with foreign payables.", "Our effective tax rate of 40.3% in the quarter was a bit higher than we expected and as compared with 35.8% last year. As a result of all this, Tiffany's net earnings in the fourth quarter were $31.1 million, or $0.25 per diluted share compared with $0.96 per diluted share last year.", "However, excluding the various one-time items in 2008 and 2007, net earnings were $0.85 per diluted share, which compared with $1.34 per share last year. While we are not trying to sugarcoat these results, we do believe that this is respectable performance in this environment.", "For the full year, net earnings of a $1.74 per diluted share were 26% lower than the $2.34 per diluted share that Tiffany earned last year. However, again excluding various one-time items, net earnings of $2.33 per diluted share in 2008 were 6% below the adjusted $2.47 per diluted share earned in 2007. Earnings in the quarter and full year came in higher than the guidance of $2.25, $2.30 per diluted share that we published in January when we reported our holiday results.", "Let's look at the balance sheet. Accounts receivables of $164 million at year end were 15% lower than at the previous year end due to the sales decline. Receivable turnover remained at a healthy 17 times in 2008.", "Net inventories at January 31st were 17% higher than a year ago. Our initial plans for 2008 called for improving inventory turnover, but we did not anticipate the dramatic sales slowdown in the later part of the year. Well it was impossible for us to completely adjust to such a sudden downturn in sales, we did quickly begin to address the sales slowdown in the third quarter by reducing purchase orders with outside suppliers and adjusting internal manufacturing levels.", "We are planning for a single digit percentage decline in inventories in 2009, which will enable us to maximize relative productivity while maintaining high in-store availability. Of course, it's important to keep in mind that Tiffany's inventory is not subject to wide swings or risks from seasonality or rapidly changing fashion trends. So, we can manage it with prudence and not with panic. Our capital expenditures for 2008 came in at $154 million or 5.4% of net sales, which included expenses spending for new store openings and renovations.", "We have already announced that we are moderating the rate of store expansion in 2009 which along with other reductions in capital spending should result in CapEx of approximately $100 million for the year. That's considerably less than our normal plan for annual CapEx to represent 6% to 7% of sales, but will still include some store openings and sufficient maintenance capital spending.", "We also shifted gears during 2008 with our share repurchase program. After spending $218 million in the first eight months of the year to repurchase $5.4 million shares, we suspended the program as our business slowed in the third quarter in order to conserve cash. Despite our current stock price, we will continue to forego additional repurchases until further notice.", "In terms of our debt position when the credit markets froze up in September, we had to postpone a planned long-term financing that we were seeking partly to refinance some maturing long-term debt. Within a few months, however, we were able to secure two important pieces of long-term financing in private transactions, one in December was for a $100 million at the rate of 9.05% with a seven-year maturity. And the other was in February for $250 million at a rate of 10%, maturing in 8 and 10 years.", "Some of you have asked about our rationale on the debt issues and to reiterate what we have said, we are not attempting to guess nor speculate on when credit markets will improve in terms of availability and cost. But rather, we decided to ensure that our balance sheet maintains more than sufficient strength and flexibility to weather a prolonged downturn if that were to occur.", "Adding this all up, we have finished the year with cash and cash equivalents of $160 million, short-term and long-term debt totaled $709 million and stockholders equity was almost 1.6 billion. Debt-to-equity at year-end was 45%, compared with 26% a year ago.", "As a result of our cautious outlook for sales and our related planned declines in CapEx and inventories, we expect our business in 2009 to generate a significant amount of free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operating activities minus CapEx of more than $400 million, combined with our recently completed long-term debt issuances, we are pleased to have a balanced sheet that provides more than ample liquidity to pursue our growth strategies.", "I want to briefly address the current pricing environment for diamonds and precious metals. Prices especially for rough diamonds as opposed to polished stones have increased substantially in 2007 and for part of 2008 as global demand soared. As demand then started delaying, after September prices were up had meaningfully corrected. So while we are paying less now to purchase diamonds, we don't expect to see any meaningful benefit to gross margin until next year based on our manufacturing lead times and finished goods inventory turnover.", "For platinum and silver, our zero cost color hedging program benefited us when costs were rising. So while precious metal costs have retreated in recent months, we won\u2019t begin to realize any meaningful benefit on our input cost until next year.", "Now let's look at our financial outlook. We have already said that we would take a cautious approach toward planning our business in 2009. And believe our expectations incorporate that thinking, which does not assume any meaningful economic improvement over the course of the year.", "So the top-line we are looking for worldwide sales to decline 11% to about $2.6 billion. Within that, we expect sales in the Americas to decline by a mid-teens percentage. We expect the decline to be greater in the first half and less so in the back half. But do not expect US comp store sales to grow in any quarter of the year.", "Within the Americas, we are also planning combined internet and catalogue sales to decline by a high single-digit percentage. We expect Asia Pacific sales to decline by a mid single-digit percentage in dollars with local currency comps declining in the 10% area in Japan and in the rest of the region.", "In Europe, we are looking for local currency comps to be about flat for the year, but expect total sales in Europe to decline by a high single-digit percentage in dollars due to the translation effect of the weaker pound and euro against the dollar. And we expect other sales which will be almost entirely wholesale sales of rough diamonds to decline by around 20%.", "We are looking for Tiffany's operating margin to decline a few points from the adjusted 17.3% in 2008 due to a lower gross margin and higher expense ratio resulting from sales de-leverage on fixed costs, partly offset by savings from our recent staffing reductions and other cost saving initiatives.", "Within that, we are planning for about a 10% decline in SG&A from the GAAP reported number in 2008. While we have reduced expenses and we will spend judiciously, we will not compromise on the Tiffany shopping experience on our product development program or on maintaining brand awareness.", "We also expect other expenses net of about $50 million in 2009 as a result of higher interest expense and we are planning for an effective tax rate of approximately 37%. So, based on our assumptions for sales and related margins, our sensitivity analysis puts net earnings from continuing operations in a range of $1.50 to a $1.60 per diluted share for the year.", "Some of you may be thinking why give guidance in an environment where there is so much uncertainty. And our answer is that like every year, we develop an operating plan to chart our direction and guide our decision-making, and we want investors to understand the specific plans and macro-assumptions. These assumptions are subject to numerous risk factors and could change during the year. So as always, please feel free to agree or disagree with us.", "We are now almost two months through the first quarter. And as we mentioned in today's press release, we have not seen any signs of improvement in sales trends. Quarter-to-date, worldwide sales are declining more than 20%, which is inline with our expectations. Regardless of short-term economic conditions, we intend to manage all parts of our business prudently and proactively and maintain a strong competitive position that will ultimately drive Tiffany's future growth.", "I will now turn the call over to Mike.", "Mike Kowalski", "Thanks, Jim. Good morning. The world experienced an economic sea change in 2008 that affected Tiffany & Company and the entire luxury retailing industry. We face an unprecedented environment with profound challenges, but also with promising opportunities for Tiffany.", "The challenges are obvious, relating to weak economies and low consumer confidence tied directly to job insecurity, stock market losses, housing price declines and short-term competitive discounting. As such, our sales have declined and earnings have suffered.", "I don't need to reiterate the measures we have taken to reduce our costs, but it should be clear to you that we are taking proactive prudent steps to mitigate the financial effects of the economic downturn.", "On the other hand, we are also looking at opportunities to expand our business through selective store growth and market share gains. In terms of store growth, we are planning to open 13 stores in 2009, which is down from the 22 stores we opened in 2008 but will enable us to establish a presence in a number of important new markets.", "In the Americas, we will add five stores, including three in United States, a second store in Toronto and another store in Mexico. Outside the US, we are planning one new store in Europe and seven stores in the Asia-Pacific, which will include several in China. In total, this will represent a 6% increase in the number of company-operated Tiffany & Company locations.", "We are also looking to take market share. Right now the overall retail jewelry industry is under enormous stress. The industry is competitively fragmented, the number of doors has been declining for several years and many expect that the trend will accelerate in 2009. Several well-known names have already entered bankruptcy.", "The jewelry industry is relatively capital intensive and capital scarcity will intensify these pressures. Tiffany's response to this market turmoil is to remain committed to offering extraordinary products and a superior shopping experience, while communicating customers to compelling long-term value that the Tiffany Company brand represents. This is how we envision increasing our share over the market.", "Our product development program produced exciting new merchandise in 2008 and the pace will continue in 2009 with a wide range of new jewelry designs.", "In addition to designing our products, we are proud of the meaningful amount of products that we manufacture in our workshops located here in New York and Rohde Island. This production is supplemented by some of the finest outside suppliers in the United States and Europe. This complementary manufacturing base insures our ability to secure sufficient product supply of the highest quality and is an important competitive advantage.", "Another important initiative taking shape in 2009 will be the launch of new Tiffany & Company brand watches later this week at the Bazzell World Watch and Jewelry Show in Switzerland.", "Through our strategic alliance with the Swatch Group, Tiffany watches will be manufactured and distributed worldwide by Swatch owned company formed as a result the strategic alliance with Tiffany. This is a long-term venture with the potential to establish Tiffany & Company as a leading brand for luxury watches.", "Clearly, there will be plenty of new product excitement 2009, and although we are reducing marketing spending in that year more or so in the US and less so in other regions, we will still provide strong advertising support to maintain product and brand awareness in both existing and in new markets.", "To conclude our call today, please be assure that we have unwavering commitment to the integrity of the Tiffany & Company brand and we will not seek short-term compromises.", "What's made Tiffany & Company an extraordinary enduring brand also long-term is that our customers trust us to create those special objects that trends in time even difficult times like those we confront today.", "Objects that are cherished pass from one generation to the next, objects that aspire, inspire that matter end at last. Those are things that are of a special importance today and there is no doubt in our minds that managing our brand to sustain and to enhance that special character remains even more critically important today and is the key to sustainable long-term growth.", "Finally, please note on your calendars that we expect to report first quarter results on Friday, May 29th. That concludes our comments on the past year and our outlook and as always please feel free to call Mark with any questions. Thank you for listening.", "Operator", "A replay of today\u2019s conference will be available starting 3/23 at 9:30 am Central Standard Time ending 3:30 at 9:30 am Central Standard Time. The phone number for international caller will be 719-457-0820 and the toll free number is 888-203-1112. The confirmation code would be 1851243.

(NYSE:TIF) F1Q09 Earnings Call May 29, 2009  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Mark L. Aaron - Vice President, Investor Relations", "James N. Fernandez - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President", "Operator", "Good day, everyone and welcome to this Tiffany & Company first quarter earnings conference call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. Participating in today\u2019s call is Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations; and Mr. Jim Fernandez, Executive Vice President and CFO. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark L. Aaron", "-- earlier today and by now you have hopefully had a chance to read the press release. The results reflected obvious macro challenges but met our expectations. Jim and I will comment on those results and on our outlook.", "First, please note Tiffany's Safe Harbor statement, that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's 2008 annual report on Form 10-K and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Now let\u2019s proceed.", "When we reported our full year 2008 results in March, we spelled out our cautious outlook and assumptions for the new year. The results that we reported this morning are keeping us on track to achieve our full-year plans.", "Worldwide sales declined 22% in the first quarter and were down 18% on a constant exchange rate basis. Let\u2019s look at our sales performance by region.", "Sales in the Americas declined 31% in the quarter. Within that, total retail sales in the U.S. declined 32% and as we saw in the fourth quarter, more than half of the decline resulted from fewer transactions, with the remainder due to a decline in the average spending per transaction.", "Our price stratification analysis indicated generally consistent results across most price strata except for substantially greater decline in the sales above $50,000. Comparable U.S. store sales dropped 34%, which were somewhat below our expectation and compared with a flat comp in last year\u2019s first quarter.", "In terms of the monthly trend, U.S. comps declined 34% in February, 39% in March, and 30% in April. Last year, U.S. comps were unchanged in February, up 4% in March, and down 3% in April, so the two-year run-rates do not indicate any meaningful change in trend.", "Our business in the U.S. is being affected by challenging economic conditions but we are also facing a headwind from continued heavy and unprecedented levels of discounting by many competitors, including liquidation sales by some who will likely be closing their stores. It\u2019s difficult to say when these competitive headwinds will dissipate but they surely will.", "Comp store sales for U.S. brand stores declined 32%, reflecting broad-based geographical softness. This compare with a 4% decline last year and was several percentage points less than we expected. There were no specific regions that particularly stood out for relative weakness or strength in the quarter. However, sales in our New York flagship store declined by a greater-than-expected 42% in the quarter, and we attribute it to weak spending, especially by customers tied to the financial sector, as well as to a decline in foreign shoppers.", "You may recall that the New York store sales had increased 16% in last year\u2019s first quarter when we were still benefiting from an abundance of foreign visitors to New York.", "Sales in the nine-store New York region declined 40% in the quarter.", "The U.S. sales decline in the quarter reflected similar percentage declines in sales to local customers and to foreign visitors. As I just alluded to, the decline in foreign customer spending was more pronounced in the New York flagship store, which had enjoyed heavy European spending at this time last year.", "Conversely, our European stores may be benefiting from this diminished travel flow, which would again point to the advantage of Tiffany's geographical diversification around the world.", "We continue to be quite pleased with the initial performance of the U.S. stores that we\u2019ve opened in the past year with every one exceeding their sales plans in the quarter. In addition, regarding our new smaller concept store in Glendale, California, we are very pleased by both customer response to the open selling environment and by the operational efficiencies we are realizing. The concept will continue to evolve in terms of store design and product offering, including the likely addition of a representative engagement ring assortment. And as we previously said, it increases the long-term potential number of U.S. stores.", "Our e-commerce and catalog businesses in the U.S. also continued to experience cautious consumer spending in the quarter. Their combined sales declined 17%, which slightly exceeded our expectation and was on top of a 1% increase last year. The sales decline continued to mostly reflect a decline in the number of orders while the average order size was down slightly. As we previously reported, we are decreasing catalog mailings this year by reducing the frequency of some mailings and relying more on e-mail marketing communications to drive customers to our website and stores.", "Rounding out the Americas are Tiffany's stores in Canada and Latin and South America, which experienced modest comp store sales declines that were nonetheless better than we expected. During the quarter, we opened our second store in Toronto in the Yorkdale section and a store in the Palacio De Hierro department store in Guadalajara.", "Now turning to the Asia-Pacific region, total sales in the quarter declined 7% on a constant exchange rate basis. On that basis, comparable store sales declined 13% in Japan and 5% in the rest of the Asia-Pacific region.", "In Japan, the 13% comp decline actually came in better than our expectation and was on top of a 7% decline last year. There was no meaningful difference in comp declines between Tokyo and elsewhere.", "During the quarter, we closed a boutique in Ikebukuro and expect to reopen later this year in a different department store in that city.", "The YEN was stronger than the U.S. dollar, averaging 96 in the quarter versus 104 in last year\u2019s first quarter, which is why a 13% total sales decline in Japan in YEN translated into a smaller 7% decline in dollars.", "The 5% comp decline in the Asia-Pacific region outside Japan was on top of a 22% increase last year and was also better than we expected. We saw mixed results in that region during the quarter, ranging from solid growth in Korea and Australia to weaker results in Hong Kong and Taiwan.", "During the quarter, we opened our ninth store in Korea.", "Tiffany's business in China continues to develop nicely. In the quarter, we opened another store on the mainland, in Hangzhou and now with nine stores there, we are establishing a strong presence on route toward our goal of at least 25 locations in the next five years. We also operate two successful stores in Macau.", "Let\u2019s now look at Europe, where total sales increased 18% on a constant exchange rate basis, as we benefited from incremental sales from the seven stores we added last year and from what we believe is our success in capturing more market share.", "The Pound and Euro have weakened substantially from a year ago versus the dollar, which caused European sales to decline 8% when translated into dollars.", "Comp store sales on a constant exchange rate basis rose by a better-than-expected 3% in the quarter. By country, there was a narrow range of comp increases and declines but every country came in better than we expected in local currencies. A comp increase in London was in line with overall Europe. In addition, this came on top of a robust 12% increase in last year\u2019s first quarter and the monthly European comp store sales trend improved as the quarter progressed.", "Lastly, sales in our other channel declined 43% in the first quarter. The decline resulted from our temporarily reducing the quantity of rough diamonds that we are purchasing in light of soft demand, which has consequently contributed to a reduction in our wholesale sales of lower quality diamonds back into the market.", "Going in the other direction was an increase in first quarter sales in our IRIDESSE stores. We previously announced that we will be closing those stores when we reach agreements with landlords and sell off their inventory. The inventory liquidation sales at the IRIDESSE stores led to the first quarter sales increase.", "So that covers our segment review of sales. Looking at a few merchandising highlights, the best performing product category, relatively speaking, was fashion silver and gold jewelry, which benefits from more accessible price points as well as a number of design introductions, like the new keys collection in a price range from $150 in sterling silver to $15,000 in platinum and diamonds.", "Keys can have a wide range of symbolic interpretations for customers and the collection is enjoying a very strong start. Designer jewelry sales, on the other hand, primarily those of Elsa Peretti and Paloma Picasso, declined in line with the overall company.", "The engagement jewelry category performed relatively better than the overall company and exceeded our expectation, although it is still posting a year-over-year decline. We are now launching Tiffany's [Bizette] collection, our latest addition in a legacy of world famous engagement ring designs showcasing diamonds in a variety of shapes.", "High-end statement jewelry sales over $50,000 continued to post the greatest declines, although in line with our expectations. Watch sales were lower, but we expect that trend to improve when new designs begin to appear in our stores later this year.", "And on another note, you may have seen the recent news that Tiffany has hired the highly regarded design team of Richard Lambertson and John Truex to explore the development of a leather accessories business. We are excited about this potential opportunity and will provide additional details at an appropriate future time.", "So that covers our sales review. Jim will now take you through the rest of the earnings statement, the balance sheet, and our outlook for the rest of the year.", "James N. Fernandez", "Thanks, Mark. Moving down the earnings statement, gross margin in the quarter came in somewhat better than we expected. It declined to 55.6% in the quarter from 57.1% last year. The decline was largely due to higher product costs, partly offset by lower wholesale sales of diamonds, which we typically sell back into the market at cost.", "Diamond prices have reversed course in the past six months and are now back to levels of one or two years ago. While we are benefiting from lower purchasing costs, the gross margin benefit is probably not felt until next year, based on manufacturing lead times and assumed inventory turnover.", "Some mines have recently cut back on their production in order to adapt to reduced global consumer demand and to help stabilize rough diamond pricing.", "SG&A expenses in the quarter declined 15% from last year, although about 3% of the decline was due to the translation effect from the stronger U.S. dollar. We continued to expect about a 10% reduction in SG&A expenses this year through initiatives already taken to reduce staffing, as well as reduce marketing spending and realizing lower sales related variable costs, all of which occurred in the first quarter.", "Interest and other expenses net were $12.4 million in the quarter versus $1.5 million last year. As we expected, higher interest expense tied to recent long-term debt issuances was the primary reason for the increase, as well as for our expectation that interest and other expenses net will be approximately $50 million for the year.", "Our effective tax rate was 42% in the quarter versus 36.7% last year, with the increase reflecting differences in the geographical mix of earnings. We still expect about a 37% rate for the full year.", "Adding it all up, net earnings in the quarter were $24 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared with last year\u2019s $64 million or $0.50 per diluted share, and this met our expectation.", "We planned our business this year to focus on cost containment and cash flow generation in order to maintain respectable profitability and a healthy balance sheet that can withstand the currently challenging environment. Our first quarter results achieved that objective.", "Tiffany has a strong balance sheet liquidity. At April 30th, we had $304 million of cash and cash equivalents versus $160 million last year. We had $822 million of total short-term and long-term debt compared with $611 million a year ago.", "During the first quarter, we completed our plan to secure additional long-term financing by borrowing $300 million, and this followed our issuing $100 million of long-term debt last December. The proceeds have been or will be used to redeem some maturing debt, as well as to further strengthen our liquidity position. As a result, we are financially well-positioned to support our growth strategies.", "Stockholders\u2019 equity of $1.6 billion was lower than a year ago, reflecting a substantial stock repurchase activity before we suspended the program last September.", "Accounts receivable of $135 million at April 30th was 30% lower than a year ago due to the sales decline. Receivable turnover remained at the very high 18 times per year.", "We told you that we plan to reduce inventory levels by a single digit percentage this year and our progress was evident in the first quarter. We finished 2008 with inventory levels 17% over the prior year because of the substantial sales shortfall in the fourth quarter. However, before the year had ended, we had already taken steps to adjust internal manufacturing levels and to reduce outside vendor purchases. Although net inventories at April 30th were 6% over a year ago, they have declined 3% since January 31st, so assuming that sales continue in line with our expectations, we should stay on track to achieve our inventory reduction objective for the year.", "Capital expenditures were $15 million in the first quarter versus $26 million last year, and we continue to forecast full-year CapEx of approximately $100 million, or about a third less than last year, due to fewer store openings and cost containment in other areas.", "Combining our forecast for earnings with a forecasted decline in working capital and a smaller CapEx budget, we continue to plan to generate about $400 million of free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures.", "Last week, Tiffany's Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend and an unchanged rate of $0.17 per share.", "In terms of our earnings outlook, we have said that the first quarter\u2019s bottom line was consistent with our expectation. We also indicated in today\u2019s press release that so far in May, the rate of total sales decline is somewhat smaller than it was in the first quarter, as we expected it would be, with a slight improvement in the Americas and greater improvement in other regions, although it\u2019s still too early to draw any conclusions.", "So we see no need to revise our full-year expectations that assume a continuation of soft economic conditions, although with sequentially smaller rates of decline each quarter due to easier year-over-year comparisons. That expectation is based on first on an 11% worldwide sales decline for the year, with a greater decline in the first half, as demonstrated by our first quarter results. By region, we expect mid-teens percentage declines in the Americas, factoring in a high-teens U.S. comp decline that we expect will get smaller later in the year, simply due to much easier year-over-year comparisons. We expect a mid-single-digit percentage sales decline in the Asia-Pacific region in dollars, which includes a high-single-digit comp decline on a constant exchange rate basis. And we expect the high-single-digit percentage decline in Europe in dollars but comps equal to last year on a constant exchange rate basis. Lastly, we still expect a 20% decline in other sales.", "We continue to look for about a three-point decline in the operating margin when adjusting for the prior year to exclude one-time items, and expect the decline to be divided between a lower gross margin and a higher SG&A expense ratio.", "In total, this should lead to net earnings from continuing operations of $1.50 to $1.60 per diluted share.", "While results are soft in the short-term, our longer term goals continue to call for achieving at least a 10% return on average assets and at least a 15% return on average stockholders\u2019 equity.", "In closing, we\u2019ve made some defensive moves to adjust for the challenging environment but we are also taking advantage of growth opportunities. As such, we are selectively expanding our store base this year by increasing the number of retail locations by 5% to 6%, and our product development and marketing efforts remain very active in creating excitement among a large number of potential customers.", "We think we are navigating our business appropriately through this stormy environment and remain focused on Tiffany's considerable longer term growth potential. We believe that when the current competitive pressures eventually wane, Tiffany will be well-positioned to increase its share of a lucrative global market.", "Please note on your calendars that we expect to report our second quarter results on Friday morning, August 28th. And that wraps up this conference call but as always, please feel free to contact Mark with any questions, and thanks for listening.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

(NYSE:TIF) F2Q09 Earnings Call August 28, 2009  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Mark L. Aaron \u2013 Vice President of Investor Relations", "James N. Fernandez \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer ", "", "Operator", "", "Good day everyone, and welcome to this Tiffany and Company second quarter conference call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. Participating on today\u2019s call is Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations; and Mr. Jim Fernandez, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ", "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.", "", "Mark L. Aaron", "", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter conference call. Before we continue please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany\u2019s 2008 annual report on Form 10-K and on other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.", "Okay, now let\u2019s move forward. We\u2019ve previously said that we planned our business cautiously for 2009. This morning we\u2019re pleased to say that Tiffany\u2019s second quarter sales of $612 million and earnings of $0.46 per share surpassed our expectations. It appears to us that the tide may be slowly turning in our favor. On today\u2019s call, Jim and I will comment on these second quarter results and on the full year outlook. ", "In the quarter, worldwide sales in dollars declined 16% from last year and by 14% on a constant exchange rate basis. This was an improvement from the reported 22% and 18% respective declines in the first quarter, and it bolsters our thinking that we can experience further improvement in the second half due to easier year-over-year comparisons and therefore achieve our full year outlook.", "Starting with the Americas, sales declined 23% in the quarter, which met our expectation. Total retail sales in the U.S. declined 26% due to roughly equal declines in the number of transactions and in the average transaction size. However, we were pleased to note a small improvement in the customer conversion rate for the first time in quite a while. Comparable U.S. store sales declined 27%, which improved from a 34% decline in the first quarter and compared with a 4% decline in last year\u2019s second quarter. ", "Within that, aggregate U.S. branch store sales were down 26% without any geographically noteworthy areas of weakness or strength. Sales in the New York flagship store declined by 30% in the quarter for obvious local economic reasons, and comp store sales in the entire nine store New York region declined 29% in the quarter. You may be interested to know that the sales decline in our Wall Street store was identical to the New York flagship.", "In last year\u2019s second quarter, branch store comps were down 6%, while you may recall that the New York flagship was up 5% as it was benefiting from a strong inflow of European shoppers. The U.S. comp trend ranged from a 31% decline in May to a 25% decline in June and a 24% decline in July. Last year U.S. comps had declined 2%, 6% and 5% in those respective months.", "As we\u2019ve seen in recent quarters, our price stratification analysis continued to show the greatest percentage declines in sales occurring at the highest price ranges. That is over $50,000. And the smallest declines at more accessible price points. From a customer mix perspective, the sales decline was attributed to lower sales to local customers as well as foreign and domestic tourists. However, the New York flagship store felt a disproportionate effect from lower sales to European visitors this year.", "The new stores that we\u2019ve opened in the past year continue to perform well. Two weeks ago we opened a 5,800 square foot store in the Roseville Galleria near Sacramento and were welcomed by a lot of very enthusiastic shoppers. And we\u2019re scheduled to open a store in the fourth quarter in the City Center Complex being built in Las Vegas. In addition, we continue to be pleased with customer reactions and operational efficiencies in our new format store in Glendale, California, and as we had previously suggested we recently added a representative engagement ring assortment that addresses the requests from many customers. We\u2019re looking forward to opening a similar format store in Seattle\u2019s University Village next week.", "Also in the Americas, our e-commerce and catalog sales are showing encouraging signs. Combined sales declined 8% in the quarter due to a decline in the number of orders, while the average order size was unchanged from last year. This was better than our expectation, and was an improvement from the previous quarter when sales declined 17%. Catalog circulation declined in the quarter which we\u2019d planned for the full year as well. We instead are relying more on the cost effective marketing benefit from email communications to drive customers to our website and stores.", "Lastly in the Americas region, we achieved solid performance from our stores in Canada, Mexico and Brazil and we are pleased with initial results in our new second store in Toronto in the Yorkdale section. So while conditions are still challenging in the Americas, we\u2019re pleased that sales trends in the first half have been moving in the direction we\u2019ve planned, and believe the picture will brighten further in the second half when we compare it to the steep sales declines last year. ", "Our full year outlook continues to call for a mid-teens percentage sales decline in the Americas including a high-teens comp decline in the U.S., which implies much smaller declines in the second half of the year. ", "Looking across the oceans, we were pleased with improving sales in Asia-Pacific and Europe. In the Asia-Pacific region, total sales declined 1% in the second quarter, which followed a 9% decline in the first quarter. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales declined 3% and comp store sales declined 4% with Japan down 11% while the rest of the region was up 5%. The results I\u2019ll cover now are all on a constant exchange rate basis. Total sales in Japan declined 13% and comp store sales declined 11% which was somewhat below our expectation and was on top of a 7% comp decline last year. Comps declined throughout the quarter with no meaningful change in the monthly pattern, nor any meaningful difference in comps within or outside Tokyo. ", "The yen averaged 96 to the $1 in the quarter versus 106 last year which generated a favorable translation effect on sales. Tiffany\u2019s business in Japan continues to be affected by softness in their economy and consumer spending, and we continue to plan for similar conditions and results for the full year.", "Outside Japan, we experienced solid improvement in other Asia-Pacific markets and as a result total retail sales rose 14% with comp store sales up 5%. This followed a 5% comp decline in the first quarter, was on top of a 13% comp increase last year and it surpassed our expectation. Business remains strong in Australia and China, but as the quarter progressed we also saw solid improvements in most other countries including Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore. During the quarter we opened a store on Canton Road in Hong Kong and in July alone it posted the second highest volume of our eight stores in that market. Next month we will open our tenth store in Korea and our plans for later this year include opening our tenth store in China in the city of Schengen and our fifth store in Australia in the Melbourne suburb of Chadstone, all of which should expand our burgeoning success in those countries.", "For the total Asia-Pacific region our sales outlook now calls for a low single digit sales decline in dollars, which is a little better than we previously expected. That would include a mid single digit comp decline on a constant exchange rate basis, with Japan performing below the rest of the region.", "Things are also looking up for us in Europe, with a total sales increase of 13% in constant currencies but a 4% sales decline when translated back into dollars due to relative strength of the dollar versus European currencies. The 13% increase continues to reflect sales from the seven new stores we opened last year as well as good underlying demand. In fact, comp store sales rose 5% in the quarter, which exceeded our expectation and was on top of a strong 11% increase last year. Despite difficult economic conditions in the UK and continental Europe, we\u2019re pleased to be achieving positive comps in London and on the continent, with the largest percentage increase in Italy in the quarter.", "The new stores that we opened last year in the UK, Belgium, Germany, Ireland and Spain are generating excellent initial results. We look forward to entering the Netherlands when we open a store in Amsterdam later this year. And we\u2019re planning to expand our presence in the UK with the opening of a boutique in Selfridges in Manchester. So we\u2019re delighted with our performance in Europe and are now forecasting a low single digit comp increase in constant currencies for the full year, which is a bit better than our previous expectation for no comp store sales growth.", "Lastly, sales in our other channel declined 66% in the second quarter. The decline reflected lower wholesale sales of low quality rough diamonds acquired through our sourcing program. Demand in the wholesale market was soft in the quarter which resulted in lower sales and related profitability. ", "Results for Tiffany\u2019s Iridesse business are now shown in discontinued operations. ", "Though we now expect sales in the other channels to decline approximately 50% for the full year compared with our previous expectation of a 20% decline. That covers our segment sales review.", "In terms of product categories, the overall trend with continued relative strength in more accessible price points that was offset by weakness in the highest price points. Within jewelry, the statement category continued to pose the steepest percentage decline, primarily due to a decline in pieces sold and not in the average price. On the other hand, fashion gold and silver jewelry was the best performing category, relatively speaking, with sales about equal to last year. ", "The engagement jewelry category declined roughly in line with total company sales, and name designer jewelry was a bit below the company average. ", "One big product launch this year, our big product launch this year actually is the new Keys collection of pendants in silver, gold and platinum with diamonds, ranging from $150 to $15,000. It is enjoying a stellar start. And the recent introduction of Tiffany\u2019s new Bezet collection of diamond rings has further expanded our engagement jewelry assortment. And despite the current challenges in the luxury watch market, we are looking forward to the launch of new watch designs this quarter. ", "We think you\u2019ll probably agree that Tiffany\u2019s second quarter top line performance was respectable in light of the difficult environment, and that our recent trends may bode well for results later in the year. Lastly, we think that our geographical diversification is a significant advantage. Tiffany has a presence in more than 50 countries through company operated stores in 21 countries, and wholesale distribution to independent retailers in more than 30 additional countries, all of which offer growth potential for Tiffany to serve customers in their local markets as well as when they travel. It is a vast global opportunity for us.", "I\u2019m now pleased to turn the call over to Jim.", "James N. Fernandez", "", "Thanks Mark. Despite challenging external conditions, we were pleased that sales in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region came in better than we expected in the quarter. Margins and spending came in pretty close to what we planned for, so it was really the better top line performance that helped to put quarterly earnings above our expectations.", "Looking at some details, gross margin in the quarter came in at 55.1%. This was 2.7 points lower than last year and was also a bit lower than our expectation. This was largely due to higher product costs, similar to what we experienced in the first quarter. While it\u2019s true that diamond and precious metal costs declined this year, reversing large increases in the prior year, we don\u2019t get the benefit in gross margin until we actually sell the product. And based on our rate of inventory turn, we should probably start to see that benefit in the first half of next year. ", "In addition, as part of our rough diamond sourcing program, wholesale sales and profitability were affected by soft demand in the diamond market for such goods and accordingly we\u2019ve also adjusted our carrying value for those goods that will be sold in the near future. ", "SG&A expenses declined 14% in the quarter, partly due to lower staffing expenses and reduced variable expenses tied to lower sales levels. In addition, we\u2019ve reduced our marketing spending this year as we previously disclosed, but believe our level of advertising and allocation by market is still appropriate to support our objective to increase Tiffany\u2019s market share. ", "In the quarter, we recovered $4.4 million on a loan to Tahera Diamond Corp. that we had written off last year, and that amount is recorded as a gain in SG&A expenses and benefited EPS by $0.02 per share in the quarter. We expect SG&A expenses to decline by a high single digit percentage for the full year. Based on this first half performance, we continue to expect that Tiffany\u2019s operating margin from continuing operations will decline in the full year from an adjusted 17.8% last year that excluded one time items, and that the decline will be about evenly divided between a lower gross margin and a higher expense ratio.", "Interest and other expenses net rose as we expected to $12 million in the quarter from $3 million last year. The increase primarily resulted from higher interest expense tied to long term debt that we\u2019ve issued in the past few quarters, and we continue to expect interest and other expenses net to total about $50 million for the full year.", "Tiffany\u2019s effective income tax rate was 26.7% in the quarter versus 36.9% last year. The rate was lower than we initially planned due to favorable reserve adjustments tied to the conclusion of some tax audits. The lower rate benefited EPS by $0.05 per share in the quarter. We now expect an effective income tax rate of approximately 34% for the full year.", "Our net earnings from continuing operations for the second quarter came in at $57 million or $0.46 per diluted share versus $0.64 last year. Even excluding the total of $0.07 per share that resulted from the Tahera gain and the lower tax rate, earnings from continuing operations were still above what we expected due to the better sales results.", "In total, Tiffany\u2019s sales and earnings performance leads us to increase our outlook for net earnings from continuing operations for the full year from the previous range of $1.50 to $1.60 per diluted share to a new range of $1.65 to $1.75 per diluted share. This includes the forecasted net sales decline of about 10% for the year, combined with the other assumptions we\u2019ve already mentioned on the call.", "I should add that our full year sales forecast assumes no meaningful change in economic conditions from the current environment, so we have not changed our sales and earnings expectations for the second half of the year. And I should also add that we have no plans for store closings. ", "In terms of our balance sheet, we\u2019re on track to achieve the objectives we established at the start of the year. Accounts receivable at July 31 were 23% lower than last year due to lower sales volume, and they are turning at 18 times per year. We\u2019re pleased that net inventories at July 31 were just 2% higher than a year ago and have declined 4% since the start of the fiscal year, which is consistent with our objective to reduce inventory this year by a single digit percentage. Our balance sheet shows a high degree of liquidity to support our current business and planned expansion. We finished the second quarter with $334 million of cash and cash equivalents versus $152 million a year ago. ", "Total short term and long term debt was $752 million versus $639 million last year and during the second quarter we paid off $40 million of maturing long term debt. Capital expenditures were $30 million in the first half of the year compared with $68 million last year due to fewer store openings and other cost containment, and we remain on track to spend about $100 million on CapEx for the full year.", "Adding this all up, we remain comfortable that we can achieve our full year forecast to generate approximately $400 million of free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures. In addition, a few weeks ago we disclosed in an 8-K filing that Tiffany entered into a new multi-bank credit facility, replacing the one that was up for renewal next year. We decided that $400 million was an adequate level, down from the previous facility\u2019s $450 million capacity. But due to strong levels of interest we did increase the number of participating banks from eight to nine.", "Summing it all up, we believe that Tiffany is weathering this challenging environment and is positioned well going forward. We have a strong store presence around the world with numerous expansion opportunities. Our brand is respected and desired. Our product designs are renowned, and we have a well developed infrastructure and strong financial position to pursue growth. It should go without saying that we will maintain brand integrity while pursuing those opportunities.", "That concludes this conference call. Please note on your calendars that we expect to report Tiffany\u2019s third quarter results on November 25. Please feel free to contact Mark with any questions and thank you for listening.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "That does conclude today\u2019s conference call. There will be a replay available until September 4th by dialing 888-203-1112 and entering the access code 9968845. Again that telephone number is 888-203-1112. The access code once more is 9968845.

Aaron - Vice President, Investor Relations", "James N. Fernandez - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Tiffany & Company third quarter 2009 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today's call are Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations; and Jim Fernandez, Tiffany's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark L. Aaron", "Thank you. Good morning and thank you, everyone for taking the time to join us on this third quarter conference call. Jim and I will comment on Tiffany's latest performance and on the full year outlook but before we continue, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's 2008 annual report on Form 10-K and on other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.", "Now we can proceed.", "Three months ago, we said on our second quarter call that it appeared to us the tide was slowly turning in our favour. This morning, we were pleased to report that Tiffany sales and earnings in the latest quarter again surpassed our expectations. In the third quarter, worldwide sales declined 3% to $598 million but were equal to last year if we exclude a decline in wholesale sales of diamonds tied to our diamond sourcing program. This followed a 16% decline in the second quarter and a 22% decline in the first quarter and bolsters our confidence that we can achieve our expectations for the rest of the year.", "Let's look at sales by segment. First, sales in the Americas declined 9% in the quarter. This was a little better than we expected and included smaller declines in the latter part of the quarter. In the U.S., total retail sales were 9% below last year due to a decline in the average transaction size and a smaller decline in the number of transactions. While store traffic was still below last year's levels, a smaller decline in the number of transactions led to an improvement in the customer conversion rate for a second consecutive quarter.", "Comparable store sales in the U.S. declined 10%, which compared with a 14% decline in last year's third quarter. It also compared with much larger declines of 34% and 27% in the first and second quarters. By month, comps declined 18% in August, 7% in September, and 5% in October. In last year's third quarter, U.S. comps had declined by 6%, 15%, and 20% in those respective months, indicating no meaningful change in the two-year run-rate over the three months.", "From a customer mix perspective, the decline in total U.S. sales was primarily affected by lower sales to local customers and also to a lesser degree, by declines in tourist spending. The New York Flagship store also experienced declines in local customer and tourist spending.", "Looking at it geographically, sales in our New York flagship store declined 8% and comp store sales in the nine-store New York region declined 9%. Aggregate U.S. brand store comp store sales declined 11%. There weren\u2019t many markets meaningfully divergent from the overall rate of decline, although for what it's worth California was somewhat softer, Florida was somewhat stronger, and our stores in Hawaii and Guam posted solid increases.", "What is most important to us is that the majority of our U.S. stores achieved their sales plans in the quarter.", "From a price stratification perspective, we continued to experience the greatest percentage declines in sales occurring at the highest price ranges, with relatively better performance at more accessible price points. But compared with what we saw in the first half of the year, the percentage declines were smaller at all price strata in the third quarter.", "Related to the high end business, we recently held our annual event in New York as well as in several other cities this year in the U.S. and Asia, tied to the publication of Tiffany's Blue Book, to which we invited some of our highest spending customers. We were encouraged with our guests' enthusiasm and with their purchases of some truly extraordinary pieces of jewellery.", "During the quarter, we opened two stores in the U.S. -- one is a 5800 square foot store in the Roseville Galleria near Sacramento. The other is a 2200 square foot store in Seattle's University Village, which is our second store in the new concept that incorporates a different approach to visual merchandising, product assortment, and selling style.", "It is difficult to evaluate the performance of a new store concept when it's launched in a challenging economy but we thought the headline in the Seattle Times on September 4th accurately described the store by calling it a new look for Tiffany's, upscale but approachable.", "For those of you in the New York area, you can get a taste of this new approach by visiting our store in White Plains, where we recently introduced some of those elements, including a new selling environment where customers are encouraged to try on jewellery while being advised by a jewellery stylist.", "Next week, we will complete our 2009 U.S. store expansion when we open our third store in Las Vegas, this one in the new Crystals at City Center complex.", "We also have our U.S. e-commerce and catalog sales in the Americas. In the quarter, a 9% decline in combined sales was due to a decline in the average order size, and in the number of orders. But we were pleased to see some improvement late in the quarter, with orders growing in October.", "We reduced catalog circulation by about 40% in the quarter, which is in line with the plan decline for the full year. However, we will continue to utilize e-mail communications as an effective way to attract customers to our website and the stores.", "Rounding out the Americas region, we achieved solid comp store sales growth in Mexico and Brazil and we are pleased with the expansion of our business in Canada with the second store we opened in Toronto earlier this year.", "For the full year, we now expect a low teens percentage decline in total sales in the Americas, which includes a mid-teens percentage decline in comparable U.S. store sales for the year.", "Turning to other regions, we were very pleased with a further pick-up in our Asia-Pacific business. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales increased 2% in the third quarter, which exceeded our expectations, and which followed a 5% decline in the first half. Asia-Pacific comparable store sales declined 3% due to continued weak sales in Japan that more than offset strength in the rest of the region.", "The results I'll cover now are all on a constant exchange rate basis. In Japan, total sales declined 10% due to a 13% drop in comp stores sales that was slightly worse than we expected. Comps declined throughout the quarter with no improvement in many months, nor any meaningful difference in comps within or outside Tokyo. There was a favourable translation effect on our sales because of the strength of the YEN which averaged 92 to the dollar in the third quarter versus 105 last year.", "On a related note, last week we reduced prices in Japan by an average of 5% to adjust for the strong YEN. We are not forecasting any improvement in Japan in the fourth quarter.", "Our Asia-Pacific business outside Japan continued to improve in the quarter. Total sales increased 18% and comp store sales gained 9%. This followed a 5% comp decline in the first quarter and a 5% comp increase in the second quarter and it was above our expectations.", "Performance ranged from continued strong growth in China, Australia, and Singapore to noteworthy improvements from the second to third quarters in Hong Kong, Korea, and Malaysia.", "You may find it interesting that the new store we opened just earlier this year on Canton Road in Hong Kong is already posting the highest sales volume of our eight stores in that market.", "During the quarter, we opened our 10th store in Korea in Seoul and in China we renovated and expanded our Plaza 66 store in Shanghai. Last week we were delighted to open our fifth store in Australia in the Melbourne suburb of Chadstone and we are getting ready to open our 10th store in China in the city of Shenzhen, both of which will strengthen our successful and growing presence in those countries.", "In fact, we are on pace to roughly triple the number of Tiffany stores in Mainland China from the current nine stores to 25 to 30 in the next five or so years.", "For the total Asia-Pacific region, our full-year sales outlook now calls for sales in dollars equal to the prior year, which is a little better than our previous expectation. That would include a mid-single-digit comp decline on a constant exchange rate basis for the year due to the softness in Japan.", "We were also very happy with our performance in Europe where total sales rose 16% in constant currency. Comparable store sales rose 9% in the quarter, which widely exceeded our expectation and was on top of an 8% comp increase last year.", "We continue to believe solid sales growth in Europe reflects our relatively young presence and growing attraction among customers who are discovering Tiffany. Our strength was again geographically broad-based. We are doing very well in London where the vast majority of our sales are made to local customers but our stores are also benefitting from increased spending by continental European and Asian visitors.", "Sales on the continent rose in most countries with noteworthy growth in Italy. During the quarter, we expanded our presence in the U.K. when we opened a boutique in South Ridges in Manchester.", "Yesterday, we entered The Netherlands by opening a beautiful 2100 square foot store in Amsterdam. Next month, we plan to open another shop at Heathrow Airport in its terminal 3, adding to the success we have had with our shop in terminal 5.", "For the full year, we are now forecasting a low single digit increase in European sales and dollars, reflecting a high-single digit comp increase in constant currencies, which is better than our previous target.", "Lastly, sales in our other channels declined 81% in the third quarter due to lower wholesale sales of low quality rough diamonds that reflect a reduction in our purchases of rough diamonds this year and therefore fewer low quality stones to resell. It also reflects a better quality mix in the assortments that we are purchasing. Therefore we expect sales in the other channel to decline by about 60% for the full year, compared with our previous expectation of a 50% decline.", "So that's the review of sales by segment. From a worldwide product perspective, improved performance in many categories, especially later in the quarter, largely reflected the comparisons to last year when sales plummeted but we think may also reflect some improvement in underlying demand in some markets.", "In any case, we were encouraged with a good increase in worldwide engagement jewellery sales in the quarter. We were pleased with growth in gold and silver fashion jewellery that was helped by the success of Tiffany's new Keys collection, which is enjoying a stellar start at all price points. We also saw improving performance in some of our other existing collections, including Return to Tiffany's, Metro, Tiffany Notes, and our collection of gold and silver charms.", "On the other hand, high-end statement jewellery sales continued to decline, albeit at a lesser rate than earlier in the year, due entirely to a decline in pieces sold and not in the average price.", "Sales of name designer jewellery were also down in the quarter and while watch sales declined in the quarter, they rose in October as some exciting new designs were launched in our U.S. stores. Take a look at our ads in today's New York Times and Wall Street Journal to see the handsome men's Atlas Dome watch from that popular collection.", "So it was a quarter with some encouraging sales trends. I will now turn the call over to Jim to comment on the rest of the earnings statement and balance sheet.", "James N. Fernandez", "Thanks, Mark. We think the numbers we reported this morning showed the resilience of our business in a still challenging global environment. Let's look at the rest of the earnings statement.", "Gross margin declined 1.5 points in the quarter to 54.8%. Precious metal costs have exhibited extreme price volatility over the past two years. As we expected, the headwinds we have encountered in the past few quarters from higher product costs tied to our slow rate of inventory turnover continued to affect margin in the third quarter, but to a lesser extent. Conversely, we expect some benefit from lower product cost in the first half of next year but for this current year, we expect gross margin to decline more than 1 point from the prior year.", "On a related note, we've been seeing rough diamond prices increase in recent months, which we attribute to curtailed mining production earlier in the year that helped to reduce supply relative to short-term demand weakness, and it is certainly still our view that over the longer term high quality diamond prices will rise as increasing global demand exceeds supply.", "SG&A expenses declined 2% in the third quarter, which was a smaller decline than we saw in the first half of the year and was pretty much as we expected. However, you may recall that we have reported a 7% decline in SG&A expenses in the third quarter last year. That decline had resulted from our reversing year-to-date accruals at that time for lower anticipated management incentive compensation as a result of the dramatic business slowdown.", "We continue to track in line with substantial expected savings from the staffing reductions made at the start of the year. We have also reduced marketing spending this year but still believe our level of advertising and allocation by market is appropriate to support our objective to increase Tiffany's market share and with quarterly sales virtually equal to the prior year, there were only minimal variable cost savings.", "Lastly, we reported SG&A expenses in the quarter, a $4 million charge or $0.03 per diluted share after tax, for terminating a management agreement after we bought out some of the minority interests in connection with our diamond sourcing and polishing operations in South Africa and Botswana.", "We now expect SG&A expenses to decline by a mid-single-digit percentage for the full year from last year's SG&A that excluded various one-time items.", "Based on these better-than-expected results, Tiffany's full-year operating margin from continuing operations should still decline from an adjusted 17.8% last year that excluded some one-time items but the decline should be less than we previously thought.", "In a year that's been filled with macro challenges, this performance should point to our long-term potential for margin expansion.", "Interest and other expenses net of $11 million in the quarter was lower than last year and a bit lower than we expected. However, last year included the write-off of an interest rate swap and some foreign exchange transaction losses. Excluding those items, higher interest expense in the third quarter versus last year reflected the long-term debt that we issued over the past year. We now expect interest and other expenses net to total about $48 million for the full year.", "Tiffany's effective income tax rate of 22% percent in the quarter compared with 32.1% last year. The rate was lower than we initially planned and was not included in our earnings guidance from three months ago due to favourable reserve adjustments tied to the expiration of certain statutory periods.", "This benefited EPS by $0.04 per diluted share in the quarter and we now expect an effective income tax rate of approximately 31% for the full year, which includes the various one-time tax benefits we have recorded.", "Adding it all up, the third quarter net earnings from continuing operations of $43.3 million or $0.34 per diluted share, were slightly below $0.36 per diluted share last year but were meaningfully above our plan due to the higher than expected sales.", "We've had a good start to the fourth quarter, with worldwide sales in November to date tracking favourably to our expectation, which calls for a mid-single-digit sales increase for the quarter but it should go without saying that results in December are most important.", "Based on the better-than-expected sales in the third quarter and some fine-tuning of our fourth quarter sales expectations in certain markets, we are now forecasting an 8% decline in annual worldwide sales versus a previously expected 10% decline.", "This leads us to again raise our annual earnings per share guidance from the most recent $1.65 to $1.75 to a new range of $1.88 to $1.98 per diluted share.", "As with the previous guidance, please note that this new range includes the benefits and costs from reporting various one-time items.", "Looking at our balance sheet, we have continued to invest in our business this year and have the financial strength to comfortably do so. Accounts receivable at October 31st were 8% below last year due to lower sales volumes and receivables are turning at 18 times per year. Net inventories at October 31st were in very good shape, down 6% from a year ago and down 4% from the start of the fiscal year. This is meeting our objective to reduce inventories this year by a single-digit percentage while maintaining high levels of in-store product availability that we believe are a real competitive advantage, especially in this environment.", "Capital expenditures of $47 million year-to-date were down from $109 million last year due to fewer store openings and other cost containment, and we are now forecasting CapEx of about $85 million for the full year.", "At the end of the quarter, we had $375 million of cash and cash equivalents, which was up from $160 million a year ago.", "Total short-term and long-term debt was $753 million versus $821 million last year. For the full year, we now expect to generate in excess of $450 million of free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures.", "I'll close my remarks by reiterating Mike Kowalski's point in today's press release, that Tiffany has performed remarkably well this year despite the dramatic downturn in consumer spending by taking the steps necessary to ensure healthy levels of profitability and liquidity while also investing in our business and not compromising our brand principles.", "That wraps up this conference call. We expect to report holiday sales results in a press release on January 12th before the market opens. The release will include any updates, if necessary, for sales and earnings guidance. However, please note that we have decided to discontinue the practice of conducting a holiday sales conference call, instead choosing to disclose all of the usual detailed information for the complete quarter when we report results in March. As always, please feel free to contact Mark with any questions. Best wishes for a happy holiday season and thanks for listening.", "Operator", "And this does conclude today's conference call.

(NYSE:TIF) Q4 2009 Earnings Call March 22, 2010  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Mark Aaron \u2013 VP IR", "James Fernandez \u2013 EVP & CFO", "Michael Kowalski - CEO", "Operator", "Good day everyone, and welcome to the Tiffany & Co. fourth quarter 2009 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today's call are Mr. Michael Kowalski, Chairman and CEO; James Fernandez, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron.", "Mark Aaron", "Good morning and thanks to everyone for joining for a review of Tiffany\u2019s fourth quarter and full year results that we reported this morning. On today\u2019s call, Michael, James, and I will provide an analysis of those results and comment on Tiffany\u2019s wide ranging plans for 2010. Before continuing please note Tiffany\u2019s Safe Harbor language that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements.", "Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K and on other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.", "Now we can proceed. What a difference a year can make. On our conference call last March we were experiencing the depths of the economic downturn and were reporting a sales decline in that fourth quarter and a drop in earnings. Against that backdrop its much more pleasing to be discussing the results we\u2019ve achieved in our latest fourth quarter, where worldwide sales rose 17% and we posted strong earnings from continuing operations at the upper end of our expectations.", "For the full year net sales declined 5% and net earnings from continuing operations came in at $2.12 per diluted share which was at the high end of the $2.07 to $2.12 per share outlook we provided when we reported holiday sales in January. At this time last year our initial outlook for 2009 called for an 11% decline in worldwide sales and net earnings from continuing operations of $1.50 to $1.60 per diluted share.", "So relative to that initial outlook we are proud of this considerably better than expected performance. Let\u2019s begin by reviewing sales results, sales in the Americas rose 14% in the fourth quarter compared with a 29% drop last year. And the growth was driven by a substantial increase in the number of transactions.", "US store traffic in the quarter did improve from the steep declines experienced earlier in the year but only to a level that was virtually equal to last year indicating that there was a meaningful improvement in the customer conversion rate. We were also pleased that the US sales increase in the fourth quarter indicated growth at all price strata from silver jewelry under $500 to diamond jewelry over $50,000.", "Comparable US store sales rose 11% in the quarter compared with a 33% decline in 2008\u2019s fourth quarter. The strong performance we had reported for the holiday season continued through January. By month US comps rose 16% in November, 10% in December, and 6% in January. In last year\u2019s fourth quarter comps had declined 39% in November, 33% in December, and 23% in January.", "The US comp growth was pretty geographically broad based. Comparable branch stores increased 8% with strength seen from coast to coast representing quite an improvement from steep declines earlier in the year. The New York flagship store increased by 22% also reversing declines earlier in the year as it also benefited from higher tourist spending.", "In fact sales rose 19% in the entire nine-store New York region in the quarter. For the full year the New York flagship store represented 9% of worldwide sales versus 10% in 2008. And despite a 15% sales decline in the year generated productivity of approximately $5,500 per gross square foot. US branch store comps also coincidentally declined 15% for the full year and you may be interested to know that the five highest volume US branch stores were once again in South Coast Plaza in Orange County California, in San Francisco, Chicago, Washington, DC, and Beverly Hills.", "US sales growth in the fourth quarter resulted from increases in both local customer and tourist spending. That\u2019s contrasted with the sales decline in the full year which resulted from lower sales to both local customers and tourists. In fact for the full year sales to non-US visitors represented 15% of total US store sales versus 16% in 2008 and 14% in 2007.", "With tourist sales not surprisingly representing higher percentages of sales in New York, Las Vegas, Hawaii, and Guam. Tourism and related spending does periodically shift due to currency swings and economic factors but most important is that we have a global store base to serve customers regardless of whether they are at home or travelling.", "In 2009 we opened three new US stores, one in Roseville, California near Sacramento, a third store in the Seattle market, and a grandly designed store in the New Crystals at City Center in Las Vegas. At year-end we operated 79 Tiffany stores in the US, and we\u2019re planning an increased rate of expansion in 2010.", "Our direct marketing sales in the US also rebounded very nicely in the fourth quarter. A 16% increase in combined Internet and catalogue sales versus a 20% drop last year was entirely tied to an increase in the number of orders shipped. For the year, despite economic challenges our combined Internet and catalogue sales in the US declined only 1% as a modest increase in orders was offset by a slight decline in the average order size.", "In addition as we had planned we reduced catalogue circulation in 2009 by about 15% to roughly 12 million catalogues as we continued to shift some resources toward online communication. We\u2019re planning catalogue circulation about flat in 2010. These combined sales represented slightly more than 10% of sales in the Americas.", "We expect a low double-digit percentage increase in combined US e-commerce and catalogue sales in 2010. Also in the Americas we\u2019re very pleased with performance in Canada and Latin America where we posted double-digit sales growth in the quarter. We opened a second store last spring in Toronto in the Yorkdale area, which is having a stellar first year and is increasing our penetration of that important market.", "And our stores in Mexico and Brazil also performed very well in 2009 with strong local currency comp store sales growth. Our plan for 2010 calls for a low double-digit percentage sales increase in the Americas, which assumes a high single-digit increase in US comparable store sales for the year. The spread by quarter will be affected to some degree by the comparison and progression of comps during 2009.", "Let\u2019s now turn to the Asia Pacific region where we enjoyed robust sales growth in practically every country except Japan. Sales in the region rose 14% in the quarter in dollars which was entirely due to increased unit volume. On the more meaningful constant currency basis, Asia Pacific sales rose 7% and comps rose 3%.", "The following comments will be on a constant exchange rate basis. Sales in Japan declined 9% in the quarter, comp store sales also declined 9% on top of a 16% decline last year. Comps declined in November and December and were inexplicably flat in January. There was virtually no difference in performance within or outside Tokyo in the quarter, which was also true for the 11% full year comp decline.", "During 2009 we closed and relocated two department store boutiques in Ikebukuro and Takoshima, and will continue to focus on maximizing profitability of the existing store base. We currently operate 57 Tiffany stores and boutiques in Japan.", "The picture looked quite different in the rest of the Asia Pacific region where constant currency sales in the quarter rose 38% due to strong growth in every country. Comp store sales rose 24% versus a 9% drop last year. In addition, comps rose by at least 20% in all three months of the quarter. After comps declined modestly in the first quarter of 2009 we posted sequentially larger increases of 5% in the second quarter, 9% in the third quarter, and 24% in the fourth quarter which we\u2019re comparing against the opposite trend in 2008 when comps increased 22%, 13% and 4% in the first, second, and third quarters and then declined 9% in the fourth quarter.", "In any case we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with our strong development in Asia Pacific and also with some excellent new store performance. For the full year, Asia Pacific comp store sales excluding Japan rose 8%. We finished the year operating 45 stores, which included the opening of six new stores during 2009 in Hangzhou and Shenzhen in Mainland China, Canton Road in Hong Kong, our second store in the Melbourne market in Chadstone, and stores in Busan and Seoul, Korea.", "In fact in the fourth quarter, the new Canton Road store already ranked highest in sales volume among our eight stores in Hong Kong. The total Asia Pacific region represented 35% of worldwide sales in 2009 versus 32% in 2008. Japan was unchanged at 19% only because of the translation effect from the strong yen, while the rest of Asia Pacific rose to 16% of worldwide sales versus 13% in 2008.", "Hong Kong alone represents more than a quarter of that 16% as it benefits from sales to local customers and to Mainland Chinese visitors. And you might find it interesting that in 2009 our highest volume single store in Asia Pacific outside Japan was in Ngee Ann City in Singapore. Our plan for 2010 calls for a high single-digit percentage increase in total Asia Pacific sales in dollars, which includes a low single-digit decline in Japan, and at least 20% growth in the rest of the region.", "Europe also posted truly excellent results in the fourth quarter with sales up 29% in dollars mostly due to increased unit volume. On a constant exchange rate basis, sales rose 18% due to a 14% comp increase and the results of new stores. In fact all European countries except Ireland and Spain, achieved double-digit comp store sales growth in the quarter.", "For the year, European comps rose 9% with increases of 3%, 5%, 9%, and 14% in the first through fourth quarters. In 2008, European comps by quarter were 12%, 11%, 8% and flat in the first to fourth quarters. As customer awareness of Tiffany continues to grow, Europe like Asia, is becoming a bigger contributor to sales.", "Europe accounted for 12% of worldwide sales in 2009 versus 10% in 2008. Our sales in the United Kingdom which includes nine stores and a successful e-commerce business accounts for about half of our European sales. We are equally pleased with store performance in the rest of Europe with 18 stores that span nine countries.", "In total, we now operate 27 stores in Europe, including three that we opened in 2009 in Selfridges department store in Manchester, in London Heathrow\u2019s Terminal 3 and in Amsterdam. Our plan for 2010 calls for a mid teens percentage increase in dollars in European sales. Worldwide, we opened 14 Tiffany & Co. stores and boutiques in 2009 and finished the year with 220 company-operated locations.", "That represented a 7% increase in the number of locations. Worldwide gross square footage rose 5% to approximately 982,000 gross square feet in 2009, including a 4% increase to 626,000 in the Americas, a 5% increase to 255,000 in Asia Pacific, and a 7% increase to 101,000 gross square feet in Europe.", "We continue to achieve high productivity in Tiffany & Co. stores and it can certainly go higher but results were effected in 2009 be economic conditions. Nonetheless worldwide sales per gross square foot in Tiffany operated stores in dollars were $2400 in 2009 versus $2600 in 2008. And by region were as follows.", "In the Americas we generated approximately $1900 per gross square foot in 2009 versus $2200. Japan was $3300 in 2009 versus $3400. Asia Pacific outside Japan was unchanged at $3800. And Europe rose to $2700 from $2500 in 2008.", "Lastly beyond our three geographical segments is Tiffany\u2019s other channel which now consists mostly of rough diamond sales since we\u2019ve closed the IRIDESSE business. We also record license revenue from our eyewear venture with Luxottica in the other channel. Other sales increased in the fourth quarter but declined 46% for the full year.", "The full year decline reflected lower wholesale sales of diamonds that did not meet our quality standards, while the increase in the fourth quarter just reflected the timing of those sales. We are planning other sales to decline about 5% in 2010. From the merchandising perspective it\u2019s probably appropriate to call 2009 the year of the Key referring to the success of the Tiffany Keys collection.", "We launched it last spring and the collection generated the highest full year sales volume in our company\u2019s history. The collection ranges from sterling silver, to gold and platinum with diamonds, with price points from $150 to $35,000. Its success reflects the combination of great design and worldwide marketing support and we believe it will be a perennial favorite among customers.", "Looking at the fourth quarter we were pleased to experience sales growth across product categories and price points. We saw a recovery in high-end statement jewelry sales which is a merchandise category that was most pressured earlier in the year. Engagement jewelry sales rose substantially in the fourth quarter offsetting most of the declines earlier in the year.", "Fine jewelry collections such as Victoria, and Metro also posted strong growth in the quarter. The fashion gold and silver jewelry categories rose strongly in the fourth quarter and rose for the year as well representing the success of Keys, along with growth in our famous Return to Tiffany, Notes, and Charms collections which all grew in the quarter.", "And the designer jewelry category which includes the designs of Frank Gehry, Elsa Peretti, Paloma Picasso, and Jean Schlumberger, rose modestly in the quarter. So you can get a sense that our geographically broad sales in the fourth quarter also spanned many jewelry categories.", "And I\u2019ll now turn the call over to James.", "James Fernandez", "Thanks Mark for that informative sales review. Good morning to everyone. We think you\u2019ll agree that Tiffany\u2019s top line performance was quite good in 2009 considering the economic headwinds we faced and certainly better than what we expected at the start of 2009.", "Let\u2019s now look at the rest of the earnings statement, gross margin of 58.7% in the fourth quarter was 7/10 of a point below the 59.4% last year, with the decrease due to the increased wholesale sales of diamonds which are minimal if any margin. For the full year gross margin of 56.5% was 1.3 points lower than the 57.8% in 2008 due the effect of higher products costs through most of the year.", "We\u2019ve been dealing with volatile swings in precious metals and diamond prices over the past two years. Prices have generally moved higher since mid 2009. Considering our rate of inventory turnover which spans about a year the effect on Tiffany\u2019s gross margin lags cost changes. While margin was pressured in most of 2009 from higher input costs than 2008 we expect to benefit in 2010 from the lower input costs at this time last year and are planning gross margin up at least a full point for the year.", "Looking at SG&A expenses we entered 2009 by making some meaningful expense reductions and Tiffany\u2019s entire organization demonstrated excellent and prudent expense discipline throughout the year. SG&A expenses increased 7% in the quarter on a reported basis. Excluding non-recurring items recorded last year, SG&A expenses increased 12% over last year and this was largely due to management incentive compensation recorded this year.", "Such compensation was curtailed last year for obvious reasons tied to financial performance. In addition sales growth in the quarter triggered higher variable costs tied to store rents and sales commissions. For the full year SG&A expenses declined 6%. We reduced Tiffany\u2019s staff count by 10% or about 900 people at the beginning of 2009 which generated annual savings in SG&A expenses and cost of sales in the area of $60 million.", "A portion of the staff reductions especially in our stores will eventually need to be restored to maintain excellent customer service levels as store traffic increases but a meaningful number of other positions were permanently eliminated and will contribute to improved operating leverage. We also reduced marketing spending by approximately $44 million over the course of 2009 and our percentage to sales declined modestly.", "In addition, variable cost tied to sales declined in the first three quarters of the year and then increased in the fourth quarter as sales rebounded. We expect SG&A expenses to increase approximately 10% in 2010 partly due to new stores and increased labor costs.", "This also includes an increase in marketing spending in 2010 at a rate in excess of sales growth to support our pursuit of market share opportunities. All in all, we expect some improvement in the SG&A expense ratio to sales. Tiffany\u2019s operating margin was 16.3% in 2009 which we think was commendable performance especially considering the challenging environment.", "The expected improvements in gross margin and the SG&A expense ratio should result in a good increase in 2010 and as we\u2019ve said before we believe there is no structural reason in the future to prevent Tiffany from achieving higher operating margins.", "Other expenses of $15 million in the quarter and $51 million in the year were above last year\u2019s levels due to higher interest expense tied to higher long-term debt levels. Conversely, our substantial cash balance is currently not earning much interest income due to low rates.", "We expect other expenses net to be virtually unchanged at approximately $50 million in 2010. Tiffany\u2019s effective income tax rate was 34% in the fourth quarter versus 40% last year. The rate for the full year came in at an expected 32% versus 37% in 2008, due to $11 million of favorable tax reserve adjustments recorded earlier in the year. We are currently expecting an effective tax rate of approximately 35% for 2010.", "Adding it all up, net earnings from continuing operations per diluted share were $1.09 in the fourth quarter and $2.12 in the full year. Please note that the full year earnings included a net benefit of $0.08 per share from various non-recurring items earlier in the year which would put adjusted EPS excluding those items at $2.04 per share.", "In 2008, Tiffany\u2019s net earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis were $0.25 in the quarter and $1.74 in the year. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations that excluded non-recurring items were $0.86 in the quarter and $2.39 in the year.", "Based on our objective that calls for 11% worldwide sales growth and the other financial assumptions we\u2019ve mentioned our outlook for 2010 calls for net earnings of $2.45 to $2.50 per diluted share. That compares with adjusted EPS of $2.04 in 2009 when excluding non-recurring items representing expected growth of 20% to 23% in 2010.", "Although we do not provide outlooks by quarter I encourage you to consider excluding non-recurring items from last year\u2019s earnings when you forecast quarterly earnings in 2010. You can find a list of the items in the non-GAAP schedule in today\u2019s news release.", "For 2009, Tiffany\u2019s return on average stockholders\u2019 equity was 15% and the return on average assets was 8%. We remain committed to our long-term objectives to achieve at least a 15% ROE and at least a 10% ROA. Tiffany finished fiscal 2009 with a very strong balance sheet which we believe is and will continue to be an important competitive advantage for us.", "Accounts receivable declined 3% in 2009. The quality of receivables remains very high and receivables continue to turn at a high 18 times per year. We were also very pleased with inventory performance in 2009. Our initial outlook for the year called for a single-digit percentage decline. The actual decline came in at 11%, which was greater than we expected due to the stronger than expected sales growth in the fourth quarter.", "Despite that, we have maintained good in store availability and are replenishing any gaps in assortment. In addition, we had reduced internal manufacturing early in 2009 but have since ramped up production to meet growing demand. We are planning for a high single-digit percentage increase in inventories in 2010 to support the opening of new stores resulting in an improved rate of inventory turnover which is consistent with our long-term financial objectives.", "Capital expenditures of $75 million was 3% of net sales in the full year and was below our normal target of 6% to 7% of sales due to fewer store openings and generally constrained spending throughout the company. We expect to return to a more normal level of CapEx as a percentage of sales in 2010, which will equate to approximately $200 million of capital expenditures.", "We began the year expecting to generate at least $400 million of free cash flow but the combination of stronger than expected earnings and lower than expected inventories contributed ultimately generating more than $600 million in 2009. We finished 2009 with our cash position actually exceeding the level of our total short-term and long-term debt.", "At January 31, 2010, cash and cash equivalents were $786 million versus $160 million in the prior year, while short-term and long-term debt totaled $754 million versus $709 million last year. And stockholders\u2019 equity was $1.88 billion at the end of the year versus $1.59 billion last year.", "Early in 2009, when global financial conditions looked pretty bleak, we took advantage of capital availability and secured $300 million of long-term debt. A portion was used to repay some outstanding debt that was maturing. We have some other long-term debt that will mature later in 2010 and are evaluating our options with respect to refinancing some or all of that debt.", "In any scenario, Tiffany enjoys an enviable liquidity position and we expect to fund our expansion in 2010 with internally generated cash flow. In fact, Tiffany\u2019s Board of Directors demonstrated its confidence two months ago when they approved resuming share repurchases and increasing the quarterly dividend rate by 18%.", "Lastly, I\u2019m pleased to say that our distribution centers and manufacturing facilities are effectively supporting our global operations and make us well positioned to expand our worldwide business and achieve meaningfully higher levels of sales and earnings in the coming years.", "I\u2019m now pleased to turn the call over to Mike.", "Michael Kowalski ", "Thanks James, I\u2019m very proud of the result we showed at every level of our organization to weather the economic storm we faced in 2009. We planned our business cautiously last year by reducing headcount and other expenses. We also closed our IRIDESSE business. However we were not completely in a defensive mode.", "We took advantage of new store opportunities although at a somewhat moderated rate. We introduced exciting and successful new products. We maintained an adequate level of marketing communications and we managed our inventories very well.", "As the year progressed better than expected sales and inventory performance combined with disciplined spending enabled us to generate stronger than expected earnings and cash flow. For much of the year, the luxury industry and especially the jewelry sector, felt the severe impact from reduced consumer spending.", "Simultaneously, some jewelers lacked both the financial resources and the brand capital to survive in the downturn. Many turned to aggressive discounting while others liquidated. It also now appears that media reports from a year ago predicting the demise of luxury and full price spending were most certainly exaggerated.", "Our research confirmed that many consumers were simply waiting for improvements in their personal incomes and their balance sheets prior to resuming spending. People are still celebrating and commemorating life\u2019s important occasions and we believe they are increasingly seeking products and brands that represent genuine luxury and lasting value. They still desire beautiful designs of high quality. They appreciate and expect a superior shopping experience.", "This is everything that Tiffany represents and consistently delivers. While the current economic environment is still fraught with challenge, there are important opportunities for us to pursue. Our plans for 2010 include expanding our store base, introducing new products and marketing aggressively in order to gain share of this competitively fragmented jewelry market.", "Our current plan calls for opening 17 new stores in 2010 including six in the Americas, eight in Asia Pacific, and three in Europe. This equates to an 8% gross increase in the number of locations and a 5% increase in gross square footage. In the Americas, we finalized leases for new stores in Baltimore, in Towson Center, in Jacksonville, in St. Johns Town Center, in Los Angeles, at Santa Monica Place, and in Houston, at the Woodlands; two additional stores are planned.", "Most of you know that over the past year we have been testing a 2500 square foot store concept in the United States that contains an edited selection of merchandise along with other enhancements in visual merchandising and selling style. Customer reaction has been quite good and we\u2019ve gained meaningful insights from it.", "At the same time we have continued to open full line 5000 square foot stores. We now believe that its appropriate to combine the best attributes of both formats into a new but smaller sized full line store. As a result the five US stores we plan to open in 2010 will offer a relatively full range of products and will average about 3700 square feet each.", "We continue to believe that the US market can support 150 stores and believe we have now settled on the right size format for future stores. In the Asia Pacific region our plans call for eight new stores including among others opening our fourth store in Singapore in the new shops at Marina Bay Sands, as well as another store in Shanghai, in the Hong Kong Plaza.", "And in Europe our plans call for adding three new stores including one at Canary Warf in London. E-commerce has proven to be very successful and an efficient compliment to our retail stores in the US, the United Kingdom, and Canada, Japan, and Australia. In fact our total Internet sales in those five countries accounted for approximately 6% of Tiffany\u2019s worldwide sales in 2009.", "I am pleased to say that we will further expand Tiffany\u2019s Internet reach this year when we launch e-commerce in continental Europe, scheduled for midyear. In merchandising we will continue to introduce new designs in a wide range of materials and price points. We\u2019re enthusiastic about a new collection of jewelry focused on yellow diamonds that will launch this spring.", "Of course there will also be other new jewelry designs introduced in both silver and gold. We are in the early stages of growing our watch business with new designs, distribution, and marketing and believe that the potential exists for solid long-term growth. And we will move forward with a wonderful new collection of leather handbags and accessories that have been designed by Richard Lamberton and John Truex.", "It will debut this year with distribution limited to a small number of our US stores as well as Tiffany.com. Our company has become increasingly global over the years and with it we have built a strong management team around the world. The organization continues to evolve toward greater decision making in each region, especially as it relates to in store product assortment, inventory management, and advertising spending.", "Local managements ultimately know their market best and we expect improved decision-making accountability at that level to generate meaningful increases in sales and market share. Clearly corporate management in New York will continue to establish control and control company wide strategic and operational decision making, and provide all necessary support to the global organization.", "Concluding my remarks the global economy still has its challenges and we\u2019ve considered it in formulating our 2010 plans and financial outlook. We\u2019ve planned for reasonably strong sales growth, factoring in comparisons to the steep declines in the first half of 2009. We think we\u2019ve also made reasonable margin assumptions and we will continue to demonstrate expense discipline.", "In terms of the current environment we are now a little more than half way through our first quarter and are pleased that worldwide sales growth is exceeding our first quarter plan which calls for a high teens percentage increase. It may go without saying but let me reiterate once again, that we do take a long-term approach to managing and growing Tiffany\u2019s business.", "Our company\u2019s reputation is built on product and brand integrity and investors and customers can be assured that we will never compromise on those values and our strengths. Tiffany has the critical components necessary for continued success, organizational and financial strength, and a premium brand that is increasingly recognized around the world for genuine luxury and lasting value.", "Please note that we expect to report Tiffany\u2019s first quarter results on May 27. That concludes our remarks. Please feel free to call Mark with any questions you have and thank you very much for joining us this morning.", "Operator", "Thank you gentlemen, today\u2019s conference will be available for a replay beginning today March 22, 2010, from 10:30 Central time ending on March 29, 2010 at 10:30 Central time.

Q1 2010 Earnings Call Transcript", "url": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/207301-tiffany-and-co-q1-2010-earnings-call-transcript?part=single", "date": "2010-05-27 00:00:00", "company": "TIF", "executives": "Parsing error", "analysts": "Parsing error", "body": ["Tiffany & Co. (NYSE:TIF) Q1 2010 Earnings Call May 27, 2010  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Mark Aaron - Vice President of Investor Relations", "James Fernandez - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Tiffany & Co. First Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] With us today are Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations and Mr. James Fernandez, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark Aaron", "Thank you. Good morning and thanks to everyone for joining us. On today's call, Jim and I will review Tiffany's first quarter results and comment on the outlook for the rest of the year. Before continuing, please note Tiffany's Safe Harbor language that statements made on this call that are not historical facts or forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's 2009 annual report on Form 10-K and on other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.", "Now we can proceed. We're pleased to say that the improved sales and earnings performance we observed in the latter part of 2009 has continued into 2010, and in the first quarter, surpassed our expectations. And we were also pleased that the growth was generally broad-based geographically and by price point, although we attribute much of this strong improvement to comparisons to the troughs of a year ago.", "Before reviewing sales by region, you should note in today's news release that we are now expanding our disclosure by geographical segment to align external reporting with changes in our organizational structure and greater decision-making and accountability at the regional level. One revision is to report Japan separately from Asia-Pacific. Also, results for certain emerging markets, such as Russia and the Middle East, where we sell to distributors for their resale in those markets, have moved out of Asia-Pacific and Europe and into the Other segment. We\u2019ve posted prior year sales on our website under the headings Financial Information and Reportable Segments. Prior-year operating earnings by segment will be reported in our 10-Q reports as we move through the year. ", "Having noted that, Tiffany's worldwide sales rose 22% in the first quarter after declining 22% in last year's first quarter. Let's now look at sales by segment.", "Sales in the Americas increased 22% in the first quarter, which was better than we expected and compared with a 31% decline last year. The 22% increase was generated by increased transactions in all major product categories and an increase in the average transaction size. Traffic and conversion rose too. In terms of price stratification, we continued to see growth in sales and transactions across the range of price strata, from silver jewelry to diamond jewelry, with the largest percentage increases in jewelry above $50,000. Of course, high-end statement jewelry was the most depressed category a year ago.", "We are now reporting comparable store sales for the entire Americas as opposed to just the U.S., although the U.S. is the largest driver of the segment, representing 91% of sales in this segment in 2009. On a constant exchange rate basis, America's sales increased 20% and comps rose 15% versus a comp decline of 32% last year.", "In terms of the monthly trend, Americas comps rose 18% in February, 21% in March and 7% in April. This contrasted with respective monthly comp declines of 32%, 36% and 29% in the Americas last year. Sales in the New York flagship store rose 26% in the quarter versus a 42% decline last year, while comparable Americas brand store sales rose 13% versus a 30% decline last year.", "The comp store sales growth was pretty broad-based in the U.S. although we did note softness in our Southwest region, as well as in Hawaii. Stores in Canada, Mexico and Brazil posted strong increases in the quarter. In terms of customer mix, more than half of the comp growth was generated by increased spending by domestic customers, with a smaller contribution from foreign tourists. We believe sales in April were adversely affected by the Icelandic volcano, which reduced foreign tourist travel to New York and some other markets too. We expect that much of that travel will eventually be rescheduled, so the spending may just be temporarily deferred.", "Direct marketing sales in the Americas also performed well in the first quarter, with combined Internet and catalog sales posting a 23% increase that was better than we expected and which compared with a 17% sales decline last year. The 23% increase was largely due to more orders shipped. But we also saw an increased average order size. Now let's look at Japan, where total sales declined 2% due to a small decline in both units and in the average price per unit sold. The yen averaged 91 to $1 in the first quarter versus 96 last year. Our full year plan is based on a rate of 95. On a constant exchange rate basis, excluding the effect of the stronger yen, total sales in Japan declined 7% in the quarter and comps declined 10%, which was below our expectations and was on top of a 13% comp decline in last year's first quarter. Comps declined in all three months with no discernible pattern. There was no meaningful difference in comp declines within or outside Tokyo and the retail environment remains challenging. Our objective in Japan is to maximize profitability there.", "The picture is much brighter in the Asia-Pacific region, where sales growth was generally strong in most markets. Total sales increased 50% in the first quarter due to a substantial increase in unit volume, as well as an increase in the average price per unit sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, increases of 37% in total sales and 21% in comparable store sales exceeded our expectations. Comps had declined 5% in last year's first quarter but since then have improved steadily and we posted double digit growth in every month of this first quarter. During the quarter, we expanded Tiffany's presence in China with the opening of an additional store in Shanghai, a substantial 6,400 square-foot store in the Hong Kong Plaza. And just earlier this month, we also opened a 3,100 square-foot store in the IFC mall in the Pudong section of Shanghai. We now operate 12 stores in mainland China and are on track to have approximately 30 stores there within about five years.", "We were also pleased with performance in Europe in the quarter, where total sales rose 25%, largely due to increased unit volume. In constant currencies, total sales rose 19% and comps increased 14%. This was better than we expected and was on top of a 3% comp increase last year. Double digit comp store sales growth was the norm across continental Europe, while sales in the U.K. rose modestly. European comps rose in all three months, although a deceleration in April might have been due, at least in part, to travel disruption from the volcano, as well as customers focused on and distracted by various European economic and political issues. We should add that the weaker euro, which averaged $1.36 in the first quarter, did not have much of a negative effect on the translation of our European results into U.S. dollars compared with the rate of $1.37 that we had planned. But it did benefit translation of results when compared with the rate of $1.30 last year. However, we are now forecasting the euro at $1.25 for the rest of the year and are similarly forecasting the pound to be somewhat weaker than our original plan of $1.55.", "Lastly, sales in our Other segment more than doubled in the quarter. This segment consists of wholesale sales of diamonds acquired through our rough diamond sourcing program and those sales were up substantially. In addition, as I said before, we now also include our wholesale sales of Tiffany & Co. merchandise to third-party distributors in emerging markets, and those sales also increased. We intend to place greater emphasis on growing our business in those markets in the coming years.", "Looking at results from a merchandising perspective, the sales growth in the quarter came from a wide range of product categories. At the highest end, we saw considerable growth in Statement Jewelry over $50,000. The Engagement Jewelry category was also quite strong, benefiting from our extraordinary assortment of designs and strong inventory position, and perhaps also reflecting some pent up demand. The Fine Jewelry category also posted a solid increase, reflecting growth of Celebration Ring sales tied to a renewed marketing emphasis, as well as the strength of other core collections such as Victoria, Metro and Hearts. Fashion Jewelry, such as the Keys and Charms Collections, were strong and right now we are lapping the hugely successful launch of Keys last spring. We were also pleased with solid sales growth of the designs of Elsa Peretti and Paloma Picasso. And lastly, watch sales were up nicely in the quarter. ", "Let's now turn to the rest of the earnings statement. It's a pleasure to report that gross margin rose 1.9 points in the first quarter to 57.8% after experiencing declines throughout last year. This increase largely resulted from sales leverage on fixed costs and manufacturing efficiencies and was higher than we expected. ", "In addition, we periodically review and adjust retail prices as we did in the first quarter to address market conditions and product cost increases, which despite volatility, have trended higher over the past couple of years. We continue to expect that gross margin will increase at least a full point for the year.", "SG&A expenses rose 13% in the quarter. This virtually matched our expectation and compared with a 16% decline in last year's first quarter. The 13% increase reflected higher staffing, occupancy and marketing costs as we expected, along with an increase in variable costs tied to the sales growth. ", "In addition, we announced on April 29 that we will be relocating Tiffany's headquarters staff to a new Manhattan location early next year. Costs associated with the move were not significant in the first quarter. We suggest you read the news release of April 29 for a description of all expected short-term costs and expected long-term savings. ", "As a result of good leverage on fixed costs in the quarter, the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales was 41.1% in the quarter versus 44.4% last year. And we continue to expect that SG&A expenses will increase about 10% for the full year. ", "Putting it all together, Tiffany's operating margin rose to 16.6% in the quarter versus 11.5% last year. Interest and other expenses net were virtually unchanged from last year at $12 million. The effective income tax rate was 31% in the first quarter versus our plan of 35% and a rate of 42% last year. The variance to our plan resulted from a benefit related to a change in tax status as certain subsidiaries associated with a previously disclosed acquisition in 2009 of additional equity interest in our diamond polishing operation. This was partly offset by a charge related to the new health care reform legislation, whereby the tax benefit related to the Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy received by the company was eliminated. Combined, these two non-recurring items benefited EPS by approximately $0.02 per share in the quarter. The 42% rate last year reflected a shift in the geographical mix of earnings. For the full year, we continue to expect an effective tax rate of approximately 35%. So in total, net earnings from continuing operations rose 135% to $64 million in the first quarter and per share earnings rose to $0.50 from $0.22 last year. I'll now turn the call over to Jim.", "James Fernandez", "Thanks, Mark. We were very pleased and encouraged with the sales and earnings performance in the first quarter. We do think however, that the economic and consumer spending environment still contains enough uncertainties to warrant continuing degrees of caution and expense discipline in our outlook.", "That said, we are excited about Tiffany's considerable growth potential, and we have the financial and organizational wherewithal to expand our strong position within the jewelry industry.", " Let's look at the balance sheet. At April 30, accounts receivable were 3% higher than last year due to sales growth and receivables were turning at 19x per year. Inventories at April 30 were 5% below a year ago. However, inventories have increased 3% since the start of the year as we replenished stores following the very strong demand in the fourth quarter and store availability has improved. Our plan continues to call for a high single digit percentage increase in inventories for the year.", "Capital expenditures were $26 million in the first quarter compared with $15 million last year. After spending only $75 million on CapEx in all of 2009 as we held back on non-essential projects, we are on track to spend approximately $200 million in 2010, representing a more normal spending rate of 6% to 7% of sales. From a liquidity perspective, we had $674 million of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter versus $304 million a year ago.", "Our total short-term and long-term debt amounted to $760 million at April 30 versus $822 million last year. Total debt to stockholders' equity declined to 39% at April 30 from 51% last year. In terms of spending a portion of that cash, we have $253 million of long-term debt coming due within the next 12 months, much of which is in Japan. At this time, we anticipate refinancing 10 billion yen or approximately $110 million and paying down the balance.", "In addition, we resumed share repurchases near the end of January. In the first quarter, we spent $14.3 million to buy 319,500 shares at an average cost of $44.62 per share. There's about $388 million remaining under the currently authorized plan, which expires next January. And Tiffany's board of directors has approved two dividend increases this year, including an 18% increase in the quarterly rate earlier in the year, which was followed last week by an additional 25% increase in the quarterly rate. But in light of obvious economic uncertainties, I want to emphasize that we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet with a comfortable level of financial flexibility. We have a robust schedule of store openings this year. Our worldwide plans now call for opening 16 stores. One previously planned store in Europe has had a construction delay until early 2011, but we are on schedule in Europe this year to open a store in London's Canary Wharf and a second store in Spain in Barcelona.", "In the Americas, we've signed leases for new stores in Baltimore, Jacksonville, The Woodlands in Houston and in Santa Monica. And in Asia-Pacific, our plans include new stores in China, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan. Beyond store expansion, we are looking forward to our upcoming launch of e-commerce in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands and Spain. ", "In addition to store expansion, we have an active lineup of product introductions this year. We recently launched in Japan our extraordinary new collection of jewelry with yellow diamonds. It's been very well received and will be rolled out to our other stores later in the year. There are additions to our Keys and Charms Collection. We are now introducing Tiffany Garden, which combines diamonds and colorful gemstones based on designs in the Tiffany & Co. archives. There's Paloma Picasso's new Marrakesh Collection, which is already proving quite popular. We will also be expanding our very successful Return to Tiffany Collection. There are new watches being introduced, and we are excited about the upcoming launch of a collection of leather handbags and accessories designed by Richard Lambertson and John Truex. And as we've previously reported, we are stepping up the pace of marketing communications this year through print and online media that will support new products as well as enhance overall customer awareness of Tiffany's offerings.", "We are now almost one month into the second quarter and consolidated worldwide sales growth is in line with our objective. For the full year, we think our sales growth projections and assumptions are reasonable. They are largely based on easy comparisons to the soft results last year and are not based on overly optimistic economic assumptions. But they do assume no deterioration in the macro environment or in consumer confidence.", "Specifically, those full year projections continue to include an 11% increase in worldwide sales and by region, a low double digit percentage sales increase in the Americas, a low single digit percentage decline in Japan, a mid-20s percentage sales increase in Asia-Pacific, which is a bit better than the 20% growth that we previously expected, a high single digit percentage increase in Europe, which is somewhat lower than the mid-teens growth that we previously expected due to translation; and other sales would be equal to last year. And we have not made any meaningful changes to our assumptions for margins, expense discipline, interest expense or the effective tax rate for the rest of the year.", "But because of better than expected first quarter earnings, we are increasing our outlook for the year from the previous $2.45 to $2.50 per diluted share to the new range of $2.55 to $2.60 per diluted share. Please note that consistent with the previous outlook, this does not include expenses related to our headquarters staff relocation or the first quarter's net tax benefit, which total approximately $0.09 per share. ", "Our success for many years and most recently has resulted from a disciplined approach to managing Tiffany's business. As we mentioned on our year end call in March, and shown now with the new sales reporting structure we have disclosed today, our organization has evolved toward greater local decision-making and accountability in each region. We expect to achieve improvements in the areas of in-store product assortment, inventory management and in our allocation of marketing spending, which should ultimately lead to a greater growth in sales and market share.", "This will be an important driver in our overall pursuit of substantial growth around the world. That concludes our remarks. Please feel free to call Mark with any questions, and we expect to report Tiffany's second quarter results on August 27. Thank you for joining us.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Today's call will be available for replay beginning today at 6:30 a.m. Central Time and will be available through June 3 at 10:30 a.m. Central Time.

[Operator Instructions] On today's call will be Mr. Michael Kowalski, Tiffany's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mr. James Fernandez, Tiffany's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mr. Mark Aaron, Tiffany's Vice President of Investor Relations. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Aaron.", "Mark Aaron", "Thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's call to review Tiffany's fourth quarter and full year performance, as well as to elaborate on our plans and financial outlook for 2011.", "Before continuing, please note Tiffany's Safe Harbor provision that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements.", "Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's 2009 annual report on Form 10-K and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.", "Now we can proceed. Tiffany performed strongly in 2010, and we presume you will agree with that assessment. It was a year in which we saw solid sales growth across most regions, with the strongest growth in the Europe and Asia-Pacific regions, leading to a sales mix where non-U.S. sales slightly exceeded U.S. sales in the year.", "In 2010, we also achieved excellent gross margin gains and maintained prudent expense control, and net earnings increased 39% to $2.87 per diluted share. However, excluding non-recurring items, net earnings came in at $2.93 per diluted share, which was above the outlook of $2.83 to $2.88 that we provided when we reported holiday sales due to stronger-than-expected results in January. ", "For one additional perspective, note that EPS came in considerably higher than the initial outlook of $2.45 to $2.50 per diluted share that we provided a year ago, and our balance sheet remained very strong.", "Let's begin by reviewing sales by region. In the Americas, sales rose 10% in the fourth quarter as an increase in the average price per unit sold was partly offset by a small decline in units due to lower silver jewelry sales. Comp store sales were up 8% on top of the 10% increase last year. Sales in the New York flagship store rose 2% in the fourth quarter, while brand store comps rose 9% due to generally broad-based increases as well as outside increases in Hawaii and Guam due to strong tourist spending.", "For the full year, sales rose 12% in the Americas, representing 51% of worldwide sales, and increased 11% on a constant-exchange-rate basis due to comp growth of 8% on top of a 14% decline last year and the incremental sales from new stores. Just to remind you, Americas' comps by quarter rose 15%, 5% and 5% in the first, second and third quarters versus declines in the first three quarters of 2009 of 32%, 25% and 10%.", "Full year sales in our New York flagship store rose 6% and represented 8% of worldwide sales. Americas' brand store comps rose 8%. You might be interested to know that outside of the New York flagship store, the five largest volume branch stores in the Americas in 2010 were in South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, California; San Francisco; Chicago; Bloor Street in Toronto; and Washington, D.C. In terms of customer mix, sales growth in the fourth quarter was driven more by local customer sales and, to a lesser degree, by foreign tourist sales.", "Full year sales growth was skewed more towards foreign tourist spending, with local customer sales increasing to a smaller extent. Sales to foreign tourists in 2010 represented 17% of U.S. retail store sales versus 15% in 2009 and 16% in 2008. I should add that the 17% of U.S. sales made to foreign tourists are to a diverse mix of customers, with more than a quarter of those sales made to European tourists and a bit less than a quarter to Japanese visitors.", "We finished 2010 with 84 U.S. stores, which included five new stores opened in the second half of the year in Baltimore, Maryland; Jacksonville, Florida; a second store in Houston, Texas in The Woodlands; and two additional stores in the Los Angeles market in the Beverly Center in L.A.; and in Santa Monica. We're pleased to report that they've all performed well in their initial months. ", "In the Americas, we also have 12 Tiffany stores spread among Canada, Mexico and Brazil. All three countries posted solid sales growth in the fourth quarter and full year, and we have some exciting store expansion plans.", "Rounding out the Americas, our Tiffany's e-commerce and catalog sales, which rose 8% in both the fourth quarter and the year due to increased spending per order. We continue to believe that Tiffany's Internet presence and the increasing use of digital and mobile technology as well as catalogs, serve as effective sales vehicles and as important marketing tools to attract customers into our stores. We increased catalog circulation by about 10% to 14 million books in 2010 and intend to increase mailings by about 5% in 2011.", "Let's now look at sales performance in the other half of our business. Our second largest region is Asia-Pacific, where business was strong all year. Sales in the fourth quarter were up 25% due to increased average price per unit sold, and jewelry unit volume also increased.", "On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales in the quarter rose 21%, and comps rose 16% on top of a huge 24% comp increase last year. The strongest comps were in Hong Kong and Macau. Asia-Pacific comps in the first three quarters of 2010 had increased 21%, 7% and 11% compared with 2009 when comps declined 5% in the first quarter and then increased 5% and 9% in the second and third quarters.", "For the full year, Asia-Pacific sales rose 29% and represented 18% of worldwide sales. Total sales in local currencies increased 23%, and comp store sales increased 14% on top of an 8% increase in 2009. Performance within the region was strong in most countries throughout the year, although sales growth was strongest in the Greater China market. In addition, Greater China represented slightly more than half of the Asia-Pacific region sales, while sales in Mainland China alone represented about 10% of the region.", "You might be interested to know that the three highest volume stores in Asia-Pacific in 2010 were in Singapore's Ngee Ann City, in Australia in Sydney and in Hong Kong on Canton Road. At year end, we operated 52 Tiffany stores in Asia-Pacific, which included seven new stores opened in 2010, ranging from four new stores in China, one in Beijing, one in Kunming and two in Shanghai, to one each in Seoul, Singapore and Taipei. We also focused a considerable amount of marketing spending on China to build brand awareness in that increasingly important country. That growing awareness is not only resulting in increased customer purchasing in China but also an increased spending by Chinese tourists when they visit other countries in Asia-Pacific, the Americas and Europe.", "The next region to review is Japan, which represented 18% of worldwide sales in 2010. Total sales rose 7% in 2010, but all of the increase was attributable to the translation effect from a stronger yen, which was 8% stronger than the prior year. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total Japan sales in the year declined 1%, and comp store sales declined 4%. Sales in the fourth quarter rose 11% due to an increase in the average price per unit sold partly offset by lower units. We began to see improved results in Japan in the last several months of 2010. Specifically, local currency total sales in Japan rose 2% in the fourth quarter, and comps rose 1% versus a 9% decline last year. Comparable store sales in Japan, which turned positive in October, were also up in November and December then dipped in January but were then positive until the earthquake and tsunami on March 11.", "Comps in Japan by quarter had declined 10%, 7% and 2% in the first, second and third quarters compared with prior-year declines of 13%, 11% and 13%. We opened one new department store boutique and closed two locations in 2010 as part of our long-term plan to address some underperforming locations and maintain strong profitability, and we operated 56 locations at year end.", "We are saddened by the recent earthquake and tsunami, and our thoughts are with the people of Japan. We are pleased to report that all of our more than 700 Tiffany colleagues are safe. As noted in today's news release, most stores in the Kanto and Tohoku regions, which include Sendai and Tokyo, were closed last week but reopened over the past weekend. We have adjusted our financial expectations only for the first quarter based on assumptions of some continued business disruptions through the end of the quarter.", "Now let's turn to Europe, which posted excellent results in the fourth quarter. Total European sales rose 14% in the fourth quarter due to increased unit volume. However, on the more meaningful constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 21%, and comp store sales increased 16%, which was on top of a 14% increase last year, and resulted from strong growth in the U.K. and across most of the continent.", "Sales growth was consistently strong throughout the fourth quarter. In the full year, European sales rose 18% and represented 12% of worldwide sales. In constant currencies, total sales in the year rose 23%, and comp store sales rose 18% due to solid growth in most markets. European comps were strong all year with increases of 14%, 21% and 24% in the first, second and third quarters on top of prior-year increases of 3%, 5% and 9%. We currently operate 29 Tiffany stores in Europe, including new stores we opened in the second half of 2010 in London's Canary Wharf and in Barcelona.", "Retail store sales in the U.K. were about 45% of European retail store sales in 2010. The three highest volume European stores in 2010 were on London's Old Bond Street, and in Italy in Milan and Rome. We introduced e-commerce in eight continental European countries in mid-2010 and are very pleased with sales results and with the enhanced brand awareness that we derived from a stronger Internet presence.", "So we finished 2010 operating 233 Tiffany stores versus 220 in the prior year. Worldwide gross square footage in 2010 rose 5% to slightly over 1 million square feet. We achieved higher sales productivity in all regions in 2010. Sales per gross square foot in the Americas rose to $2,100 in 2010 from $1,900, which included sales productivity of $5,400 per square foot in the New York flagship store. In Japan, sales productivity rose to $3,500 from $3,300. In Asia-Pacific, it increased to $4,000 from $3,800. And in Europe, it increased to $3,000 from $2,700. For the total company, sales per gross square foot rose to $2,600 from $2,400 in 2009. ", "And beyond our stores, worldwide e-commerce included in our four segments has become a meaningful contributor to our overall sales. In fact, total e-commerce sales represented 6% of worldwide sales in 2010 and 2009 and accounted for 8% of total sales in the countries where we have an Internet presence. We continue to believe that the percentage can move a bit higher in the future. ", "Rounding out the sales review is our Other segment in which sales declined 30% in the quarter and rose 2% in the year. This segment is largely composed of two pieces: wholesale sales of products to third parties who operate Tiffany stores, mostly in the emerging markets of Russia and the Middle East, as well as wholesale sales of diamonds acquired through our rough diamond sourcing program. The 30% decline in Other sales in the quarter was more than entirely due to lower wholesale sales of diamonds. The 2% increase in the year reflected an increase in emerging market sales, mostly offset by a decline in diamond sales. ", "One cannot fully review the year without highlighting some of our merchandising successes in 2010. We were pleased to see relatively broad-based sales growth across most product categories. Diamond engagement jewelry sales were strong. Fine and fashion gold jewelry, such as Tiffany\u2019s Victoria collection, Celebration Rings and our Metro collection performed well, reflecting strength of higher-end transactions in diamonds, platinum and gold. We are very pleased with the introduction and success of the new and extraordinary yellow diamond collection, which we expect will be successful for many years, as well as Tiffany's new Garden jewelry collection. ", "Worldwide silver jewelry sales rose only modestly due to what we think is macro-related softness in the Americas. In fact, the weakness in silver jewelry sales in the U.S. was the reason that the under-$500 price strata declined in the U.S., while all of the higher price point strata rose. Our Keys Collection, which spans multiple materials and prices, remained very popular, and we added new styles as well, although overall growth was muted by comparison to the incredibly strong launch in 2009. The designer jewelry category did well, reflecting the success of Paloma Picasso's new Marrakesh collection and the ongoing popularity of Elsa Peretti's Diamonds by the Yard collection, among many others. ", "We are very pleased with the initial success of our new leather collection, and Tiffany brand watch sales grew more than 30% in our own stores. So that covers the sales review. I'll now turn the call over to Jim for a look at the rest of the earnings statement and specifically the components of stronger growth in the operating margin.", "James Fernandez", "Thanks, Mark, and hello to all of you. We were pleased to deliver strong sales and earnings growth in 2010, while we also continued to invest in our business to achieve further and strong long-term performance. Tiffany's gross margin in the quarter was 60.9% compared with 58.7% last year. For the full year, gross margin increased 260 basis points to 59.1%. In both the quarter and year, the increased gross margins were primarily due to the recapture of two years of higher product costs through retail price increases early in 2010, as well as manufacturing efficiencies and sales leverage on fixed costs that are included in cost of sales.", "Those fixed costs include distribution centers and our merchandising and diamond sourcing organizations. We also increased prices in January of 2011 in many categories to offset cost increases, but we expect a much more modest rate of gross margin improvement in 2011 that would be consistent with our long-term goals.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 12% in the fourth quarter and rose 13% in the full year. Much of the increase was due to higher staffing and occupancy costs, fixed and variable, in new and existing stores, but marketing spending also increased substantially as we had planned throughout the year. In fact, the marketing-to-sales ratio increased as we had expected from 5.9% in 2009 to 6.4% in 2010. SG&A growth also included $6.1 million in the quarter and $16.6 million in the year of non-recurring expenses related to the upcoming relocation of our New York headquarters staff. ", "Excluding the non-recurring expenses, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 35.1% in the quarter and 39.2% in the year, both of which represented improvement from 35.8% and 40.2% in 2009. Approximately 80% of our SG&A expenses are fixed in nature, so strong sales growth provides us with the ability to leverage those costs and further improve the expense ratio.", "Adding this up, Tiffany's operating margin in the full year increased 300 basis points to 19.3% in 2010 and was 19.8% when excluding non-recurrent items. Other expenses net, which is primarily interest expense, declined modestly in both the fourth quarter and the full year. Tiffany's effective tax rate was 32.1% in the fourth quarter versus 34.2% last year. For the year, the rate came in at 32.7% due to some non-recurring items versus 31.9% last year, which had also included the recording of some favorable tax reserve adjustments. Bottom line, Tiffany's net earnings from continuing operations increased 31% in the fourth quarter and rose 39% to $368 million or $2.87 per diluted share in the year.", "Excluding non-recurring items in 2010 and 2009, net earnings rose 47% in the year. We achieved an 18% return on average stockholders' equity and a 10% return on average assets, both of which achieved our performance objectives, and we are confident in our long-term ability to sustain strong returns.", "Strong sales growth requires an efficient infrastructure behind the scenes to support that expansion, and most of you know that we have made substantial investments over the past decade, which continued to benefit us in 2010. Our internal manufacturing facilities produced approximately 60% of Tiffany merchandise sold. We've expanded our U.S.-based manufacturing operations into Lexington, Kentucky in temporary space and will soon open a 25,000 square-foot facility that will employ 125 skilled craftspeople and provide us with increased jewelry production capacity beyond the facilities we have in New York and Rhode Island.", "Our two major distribution centers in New Jersey are also working very well, with one that is efficiently handling worldwide store replenishment and the other that processes direct-to-customer shipments. There is room for additional capacity utilization in both facilities, which will contribute to improved profitability. And our diamond sourcing organization is successfully operating globally to source and fulfill Tiffany's steadily increasing requirements for high quality diamond supply. ", "We finished the year with a strong balance sheet that positions us very well competitively. In fact, cash and short-term investments exceeded total debt. At January 31, 2011, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $741 million versus $786 million at the prior year end. Short-term and long-term debt totaled $688 million at January 31 versus $754 million a year ago. During the year, we paid off $219 million of maturing long-term debt and entered into $118 million at issuance of new long-term debt in Japan at an attractive rate of 1.72%. Stockholders' equity rose to almost $2.2 billion at the end of 2010 from almost $1.9 billion a year ago. And that put the debt-to-equity ratio at 32% at year end versus 40% a year ago. And in 2010, Tiffany generated $172 million of free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures.", "Reflecting that financial strength, Tiffany's Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend twice in 2010 for a cumulative increase of 47%. The board also recently approved the new share repurchase plan to replace a plan that was set to expire, authorizing repurchases of up to $400 million through January of 2013. In 2010, we spent $81 million to repurchase 1.8 million shares at an average cost of $43.83 per share, with most of that spending occurring under the expiring plan. At January 31, $392 million remained available for future repurchases.", "Net inventories increased 14% in 2010. That was comprised of a 9% increase in finished goods inventories and a 22% increase in raw material and work-in-process inventories to support sales growth, new stores, new product launches and higher product acquisition costs. Foreign currency translation was a small portion of the overall 14% inventory increase, and we intend to maintain very high inventory availability in our stores going forward.", "For 2011, our plans call for net inventories to increase by more than 15% for several reasons: First, to support planned sales growth; second, for new store openings; third, for additional investments in high-end statement jewelry; and fourth, to further increase purchases of rough diamonds as we pursue our vertical integration strategy that provides supply and related cost benefits.", "Accounts receivable rose 17% in 2010 with about five points of the increase due to foreign currency translation. Receivables turnover stayed at a healthy 18x per year. Capital expenditures in 2010 came in at $127 million or 4.1% of net sales, which was up from depressed spending of $75 million in 2009 when we cut back on all nonessential spending. However, CapEx in 2010 was lower than our initial projection of $200 million, mostly due to delayed spending on certain projects, especially on the New York relocation that will be incurred in 2011. Therefore, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $250 million to $275 million in 2011, which would represent 7% to 8% of total sales and is relative to our long-term projected CapEx of 6% to 7% of sales. ", "We are now providing you with our first outlook for 2011. Now let's look at the components of our annual sales and earnings guidance for 2011. I should begin by pointing out that the financial projections for the year that we are sharing with you today incorporate some effect in the first quarter from the devastating events in Japan on March 11. Specifically, we are projecting worldwide net sales to increase 12% to 14% in 2011. ", "Looking at it by geographic region, we are looking for sales in the Americas to increase by a low double-digit percentage with comps up high single digits and combined Internet and catalog sales in the Americas also increasing by a high single-digit percentage. We expect sales in Asia-Pacific to increase by at least 20% in dollars, with local currency comps increasing by a mid-teens percentage. In Japan, we are projecting total and comp store sales to decline by a mid-single digit percentage for the year in dollars and yen, factoring in the current events in Japan that are affecting our first quarter sales there. And in Europe, we expect sales to increase by more than 20% in dollars, with local currency comps increasing by a low double-digit percentage.", "In addition, we are projecting Other sales to increase by more than 30% due to strong growth in wholesale sales to distributors, primarily in the emerging markets of Russia and the Middle East, while we expect only a modest increase in wholesale sales of diamonds. We are not looking for any significant differences in total sales growth by quarter except for slightly stronger growth in the second quarter as we consider the year-over-year comparisons. In addition, these sales projections assume no meaningful changes in foreign currency rates versus the U.S. dollar from the rates at the start of the year.", "Moving down the earnings statement, we are looking for gross margin to increase by a couple of tenths of a point. We have addressed higher product costs with recent retail price increases in many product categories, and there could be other increases later in the year as well, if necessary. We cannot identify any meaningful resistance to the price increases in that customers are knowledgeable of higher costs and understand the need for us to address it. Other jewelers have also been affected by higher costs, and we assume they are also increasing their prices, so Tiffany's competitive position remains strong.", "We are also looking for SG&A expenses to increase about 12% to 13% in total 2011. This excludes non-recurring items related to the upcoming New York headquarters staff relocation. These items specifically relate to incremental rental costs and accelerated depreciation on fixed assets, as well as a charge associated with the non-cancelable obligations remaining under the existing leases, which are expected to total about $40 million or $0.19 per diluted share after-tax, with most of the charge being recorded in the second quarter when we relocate. ", "SG&A expense growth also reflects marketing spending that will increase somewhat faster than sales growth, so that the marketing to sales ratio continues to move higher. With the sales growth that we are projecting, this should result in a few tenths of a point improvement in the expense ratio excluding non-recurring items, and this would take the operating margin to just above 20% when excluding non-recurring items.", "We are projecting other expenses net, which is primarily interest expense, to be relatively unchanged at about $46 million for the year. We expect Tiffany's effective tax rate to come in at about 34% for the full year. Therefore, we are now projecting net earnings, excluding non-recurring items, to increase 14% to 18%, and earnings per diluted share increasing to a range of $3.35 to $3.45 per share. ", "As you know, we typically do not provide guidance on a quarterly basis but will do so for this first quarter in light of the significant events in Japan. As such, we expect that first quarter earnings per diluted share, excluding non-recurring items, will be reduced by approximately $0.05 per share from our initial expectation of $0.62 per diluted share to approximately $0.57 per diluted share versus $0.48 per share in last year's first quarter excluding non-recurring items. We cannot provide any forecast for Japan for subsequent quarters, so our expectation for the second, third and fourth quarter continues to call for sales roughly equal to the prior year in Japan. ", "Lastly, we are assuming that the share count will be roughly unchanged at about 128 million shares as share repurchases offset the effect of option exercises. We believe that Tiffany has the necessary ingredients to achieve solid performance in 2011, and now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mike.", "Michael Kowalski", "Thanks, Jim. At the risk of repeating what's already been said, Tiffany truly prospered in 2010, achieving strong and better-than-expected sales and earnings growth. Our business began to strengthen in the latter part of 2009, and the rebound gained momentum during 2010. We're immensely proud of the accomplishments of the more than 9,000 Tiffany employees who are responsible for that success. Our results clearly demonstrate the power of a global expansion program that has provided a platform for robust and sustainable growth as an international luxury brand. In 2010, we expanded our store base, increased our e-commerce reach and communicated Tiffany's message across an ever wider global audience.", "For the first time, worldwide sales are now essentially equally divided between the United States and the rest of the world. With 233 company-operated stores in 22 countries along with independently operated locations in additional 30 countries, we have a solid base of distribution to serve increasing numbers of global customers, and that base will continue to grow. ", "Specifically, in 2011, we are planning to open 21 stores. This will include eight stores in the Americas, with plans for four United States stores. We've already announced Northbrook, Illinois and Richmond, Virginia; three in Canada, in Calgary and two additional cities; and we hope to finalize plans for a store in Brasilia to expand our growing presence in the important market of Brazil. We are planning to open eight stores in Asia-Pacific, including four stores in China, three in Korea and one in Taiwan. And we are planning five stores in Europe, including both the Z\u00fcrich and Frankfurt Airports, along with additional stores in France and Italy. In total, this will represent a 9% increase in the number of company-operated locations and a 5% increase in square footage. ", "We also expect to derive continuing sales benefits from Tiffany's expanded Internet presence. This will enable us to reach customers who appreciate e-commerce convenience, whether they live far or near to our store, recognizing, however, that no online experience, however extraordinary, can replicate the outstanding Tiffany in-store experience.", "In addition, we believe there's important growth potential in emerging markets like the Middle East and in Russia where Tiffany's distribution is currently managed through third parties. Our total wholesale sales of products in those markets and other markets in 2010 represented only 3% of worldwide sales, and we believe there is much untapped growth potential. And we hope to soon finalize plans for Tiffany to enter India.", "We have a very full pipeline of exciting new designs for 2011 in a full range of materials and price points. A few highlights include our new collection of locks, pendants and bracelets executed in silver, gold and platinum, with prices ranging from $100 to $10,000. We are also excited that this year, Elsa Peretti is reintroducing and expanding her bottle collection, an iconic pendant design that dates back more than 30 years. We are also looking forward to an important new collection from Paloma Picasso. There will, of course, be many, many additional new jewelry designs introduced in 2011. There will also be expanded assortments in personal accessories, building on the successful launch of our handbag collection, as well as in sunglasses. ", "Regarding watches, while sales in Tiffany's own stores have been strong, we have been disappointed with the slower-than-expected rollout of wholesale watch distribution. As we have indicated for some time, while over the short to medium term, the expected contribution to sales and earnings from watches is minimal. Over the long term, we remain hopeful about the ultimate potential of the Watch business. We are also hopeful that our differences with our watch partner can be resolved collaboratively and professionally. ", "Finally, we continue to look to grow our high-end Statement business by strengthening and strategically redeploying our inventory assortment with a special emphasis on taking maximum advantage of the newly completed jewel salon in our flagship store as a global destination for the most spectacularly crafted jewelry in the world.", "Regarding margins, Tiffany and the entire jewelry industry are continuing to deal with higher product input costs for precious metals and diamonds. However, we have successfully increased retail prices to offset those costs, and we believe that the combination of Tiffany's pricing power and strong competitive position will allow us to do so, if necessary, again in the future. ", "Our marketing communications will reach a growing base of potential customers around the world through print media and various forms of electronic communication, and we are beginning to formulate our plan to commemorate in 2012 the 175th anniversary of Tiffany's founding in 1837. We continue to monitor the events in Japan and the continued safety of our more than 700 employees and their families there. Our thoughts are with all of the people of Japan.", "On a worldwide basis, I believe we have planned our business prudently for all of 2011 with a healthy rate of store expansion into attractive new markets and underserved existing markets and with a rate of spending to support that growth and further invest in strengthening Tiffany's worldwide competitive position. And of course, given our organization and financial strength, we will maintain our long-term strategic focus of continuing to build upon the foundation of one of the world's great brands. ", "Lastly, we are excited about relocating our New York headquarters staff in the coming months to a location at Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street. As we previously said, it will provide organizational efficiencies with substantial long-term cost savings. We look forward to welcoming many of you there. ", "Thank you for listening to our review of 2010 and our plans for 2011. We look forward to updating you on the progress throughout the year. Please note on your calendars that we expect to report Tiffany's first quarter results on Thursday, May 26. Please feel free to call Mark with any questions. That concludes today's call. Thank you for your ongoing interest.", "Operator", "A replay of today's call will be available starting today, March 21 at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time through March 27 at 11:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.

(NYSE:TIF) Q1 2011 Earnings Call May 26, 2011  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "James Fernandez - Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President", "Mark Aaron - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Tiffany & Co. First Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Speaking on today's call will be Mr. Jim Fernandez, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark Aaron", "Thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's conference call on which Jim and I will be reviewing Tiffany's first quarter performance, as well as addressing our full year outlook.", "Before continuing, please note Tiffany's Safe Harbor provision that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements.", "Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's 2010 annual report on Form 10-K and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.", "Now we can proceed. In our opinion, Tiffany's first quarter results were nothing short of outstanding. Sales growth was strong in the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific while sales in Japan were better than expected after the tragic earthquake and tsunami. And strong sales growth contributed to a higher than expected operating margin and net earnings, which led us to increase our full year earnings outlook. ", "Let's begin by looking at sales in our geographical segments. Starting with the Americas, total sales increased 19% in the quarter, primarily due to an increase in the average price per unit sold, as well as higher unit volume, especially in engagement jewelry and other high-end jewelry. Comparable store sales in constant currency rose 17% on top of a 15% increase last year. We achieved double-digit comps in all 3 months, and the trend strengthened as the quarter progressed.", "Geographically, we achieved solid sales growth in the U.S. as well as growth in Canada and Latin America. Sales in our New York flagship store rose by a strong 23%, which was on top of a 26% sales increase in last year's first quarter. Comparable Americas brand store sale rose 15% on top of a 13% increase last year. U.S. sales growth was solid from coast-to-coast. Interestingly, despite some speculation that sales in Hawaii and Guam would suffer from a decline in Japanese tourism following the earthquake, sales in that 6 store region rose more than 30% in the quarter. And from a customer mix perspective, the sales increase in the Americas came from higher spending by domestic customers and foreign visitors, which was also true in the New York flagship store. The 5 new stores opened in the past year in the Americas are performing well. We did not add any new stores in the first quarter, although earlier this month, we opened a store in Northbrook, Illinois, representing our fourth store in the important Chicago market and a store in Calgary, Alberta, which represents our fourth company operated store in Canada. ", "Our direct marketing sales in the Americas also did well in the quarter. Combined e-commerce and catalog sales rose 14% due to similar increases in the number of orders and in the average size per order. That was on top of a 23% sales increase last year.", "Let's now turn to the Asia-Pacific region, where sales rose 37% in the quarter due to increases both in the average price per unit sold and in the number of jewelry units sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales rose 31% and comparable store sales rose 26%, which was on top of a 21% comp last year. This was substantially better than we expected. Sales were consistently strong in most markets throughout the quarter, with noteworthy strength in the Greater China market, as well as in Korea. ", "I should also mention that we are pleased with the overall initial performance of the 7 new stores that we opened over the past year in that region. ", "Now let's look at Japan, which has been of concern since the tragic earthquake and tsunami on March 11. Tiffany's business has improved there, although the total sales increase of 7% was due to the translation of the yen, which at JPY 82 to the $1 in the quarter was 10% stronger than last year. We are currently forecasting the yen to remain in the 80s for the rest of the year. ", "Excluding the translation effect, sales in Japan in yen in the quarter declined 3% both in total and on a comparable store basis, which compared with a 10% comp decline last year. This was still much better than what we expected when we last reported to you on March 21 during a time of considerable uncertainty. The sales trend in Japan during the quarter was understandably very volatile, with almost 1/2 of our stores closed for about a week after the earthquake. In fact, comps in Japan in yen increased 3% in February then declined 16% in March and finished the quarter with a 6% increase in April. This compared with declines of 10%, 10% and 9% in February, March and April of last year. Not surprisingly, sales were softer in the Northern Tohoku and centrally located Kanto regions, which were more directly affected by the earthquake and its aftereffects as opposed to the Southwestern Kansai region. We would not be surprised with continued volatility in Japan sales for a while.", "During the first quarter, we opened a new department store boutique in Hakata, and closed 2 department store boutiques in Kokura and Wakayama as we have planned and finished the quarter operating 55 locations in Japan. ", "Now turning to Europe. Total sales increased 25% due to strong unit volume growth that exceeded an increase in the average price per unit sold. On the constant exchange rate basis, total sales rose 19% and comparable store sales rose 15% on top of a 14% comp increase in last year's first quarter. This was slightly better than we expected and the intra-quarter trend was strongest in April.", "Geographically, we strong saw sales growth in most continental European countries with the greatest gains in France, Germany and Italy. Sales growth was more modest in the U.K., although sales there did strengthen later in the quarter. And the new stores we opened late last year in London's Canary Wharf and in Barcelona are exceeding our expectations.", "Lastly, other sales declined 18% in the first quarter due to a decline as we expected in wholesale sales of rough diamonds. However, wholesale sales to independent distributors in emerging markets rose strongly in the quarter.", "Turning to some first quarter product highlights. The broad-based strength in our geographic segments was also true across most product categories. On a worldwide basis, all major jewelry categories posted double-digit percentage growth in the quarter. At the high end, statement jewelry had a good increase. The fine and fashion jewelry categories performed very well, highlighted by Celebration Rings, the Metro and Victoria collections, Keys, Return to Tiffany and the relatively new Garden and yellow diamond collection. Engagement jewelry sales were strong as were gold jewelry sales.", "There was also a decent growth in silver jewelry sales for Tiffany's own designs, and we were pleased to see some growth in silver jewelry sales in the Americas as well. Sales of the design of Elsa Peretti and Paloma Picasso rose nicely too. But the U.S. economic environment that is affecting spending by some of our silver jewelry customers at entry-level price points will likely remain challenging for a while.", "In other categories, watch sales continued to post 30-plus percent growth in our own stores, and we're pleased with the Tiffany Leather collection. In fact, this year, we are expanding leather distribution into more of our stores in the Americas and to some stores in other regions. As an example, we launched the Leather Collection in a few stores in Japan in April, and are quite pleased with initial results. So that covers the sales review. ", "Looking at the rest of the earnings statement, gross margin in the first quarter rose 0.5 point to 58.3% from 57.8% last year, primarily due to lower wholesale sales of diamonds and sales leverage on fixed costs. Conversely, changes in product mix and higher product costs had an unfavorable impact on gross margin. As we previously reported, we raised retail prices in many product categories earlier in the year to mitigate substantial increases in precious metal and diamond costs. You should, of course, keep in mind that the labor costs component is increasing to a lesser degree. In any case, customers are certainly aware of rising commodity costs, and we have not experienced any meaningful resistance to higher prices.", "SG&A expenses rose 18% in the quarter, largely due to higher occupancy costs for new and existing stores, increased staffing and increased marketing spending.", "SG&A expenses also included $8 million or $0.04 per share after-tax of non-recurring items for the upcoming relocation of our New York headquarters staff. Those expenses relate to accelerated depreciation in property and equipment, incremental rent during this transition period until the move occurs in the second quarter and payments related to terminating leases for certain floors that we will soon be vacating. ", "The ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales improved by 0.7 point to 40.4% in the quarter versus 41.1% last year. However, if you exclude the nonrecurring items from SG&A expenses, the ratio would have improved year-over-year by 1.6 points. ", "Based on the strong sales growth and our gross margin and SG&A expense performance, we achieved a substantial increase in operating margin in the quarter. In fact, the operating improved 1.3 points over last year and excluding nonrecurring items, it improved an even greater 2.1 points over last year.", "Other expense net, which is primarily interest expense, was slightly lower in the quarter, and the effective tax rate was 35.6% in the quarter. ", "Last year's effective tax rate of 30.9% reflected a nonrecurring net tax benefit, primarily related to a change in the tax status of certain subsidiaries, which had benefited earnings by $0.02 per share in the first quarter last year.", "Adding it all up, Tiffany's net earnings increased 26% in the quarter, and earnings per diluted share were $0.63. Excluding nonrecurring items in both years, net earnings rose 39% and EPS was $0.67. This was above our previously stated guidance of $0.57 per share for the first quarter, which also excluded nonrecurring items.", "Lastly, return on average assets and return on average stockholder's equity are 11% and 18%, respectively. ", "I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Jim.", "James Fernandez", "Thanks, Mark. I'm delighted to review with everyone other aspects of the strong results we reported this morning and to comment on our outlook. Tiffany has a strong balance sheet and a well-developed infrastructure to support the expansion of our business. I'd like to address both these areas.", "Tiffany finished the quarter with $622 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Total short-term and long-term debt was $687 million. ", "In April, we paid off a JPY 5 billion or $59 million, 4.50% long-term loan that matured. Total debt to stockholders' equity was 30% at April 30 versus 39% at April 30, 2010. We are using Tiffany's strong balance sheet to expand our business while also returning some of the cash to stockholders. ", "Net inventories at April 30 were 17% higher than a year ago due to sales growth, new stores, new products and higher product acquisition costs. I should also add that about 1/4 of the inventory increase was due to foreign exchange translation. We are projecting inventories to increase at least 15% this year to support anticipated sales demand and the 19 new stores we plan to open.", "In addition, we are increasing our statement jewelry inventory to strengthen our assortments in key markets around the world, and we intend to opportunistically increase our purchases of rough diamonds. ", "Accounts receivable at April 30 were up 26% from a year ago, primarily due to the strong sales growth as well as some effect from foreign currency translation. Receivables continue to turn at a high 18x per year. ", "Capital expenditures were $52 million in the first quarter versus $26 million last year. We expect that CapEx will increase to approximately $250 million for the full year versus $127 million in 2010 due to a variety of factors including a higher number of store openings this year, renovations of existing stores, which in some cases reflect the catch up for 2 years of deferred spending; and lastly, the relocation of our New York headquarters staff to a new office facility. ", "In our share buyback program we spent $28 million in the first quarter to repurchase approximately 453,000 shares at an average cost of $61.68 per share. And that leaves us with $364 million of remaining capacity under the currently authorized program that runs through January of 2013.", "Last week, Tiffany's Board of Directors expressed its confidence by approving a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend rate, taking the rate to $0.29 per share or an annual rate of $1.16 per share. That represented the 9th dividend increase in the past 9 years. ", "I alluded earlier to Tiffany's infrastructure because it plays a key role in the execution of our growth plans. Our centralized distribution centers are very effectively handling worldwide shipments of products to our stores and our customers. Our internal manufacturing facilities in New York and Rhode Island last year produced 60% of the products we sold. We have recently expanded our U.S. production capacity into Lexington, Kentucky with the hiring of skilled workers and will soon move from the temporary space there to a newly constructed 25,000 square-foot facility. ", "And our diamond sourcing organization has developed a global reach to ensure that Tiffany has the necessary supply of the highest quality diamonds for our customers. We are excited about the upcoming relocation of our New York headquarters staff in a few weeks to 200 Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street. The new location will allow us to operate more efficiently and we anticipate meaningful cost savings over the lease term. ", "Now let's turn to our financial outlook. The results we reported today unquestionably represented a terrific start to the year and we have factored them into our thought process for the rest of the year. At the same time, the first quarter represents the smallest sales quarter of the year and with lingering macroeconomic uncertainties, we do not want to get ahead of ourselves in our full year outlook.", "Our initial plan for the year included solid sales growth in all regions except Japan and we continue to expect that. ", "For the full year by region, we look for sales in the Americas to increase by a mid-teens percentage with local currency comps up by a low-double digit percentage. In Asia-Pacific, we expect sales to increase by a mid-20s percentage with local currency comps up about 20%. We are also looking for sales in Europe to increase by a mid-20s percentage with local currency comps up by a low-double digit percentage. For Japan, we were previously expecting a mid-single digit decline for the year. As we expected, a substantial decline in the first quarter as a result of the earthquake. We truly appreciate the efforts of our colleagues in Japan during such a challenging experience. There are obviously still uncertainties in Japan and the potential for disruptions and reduced store hours in the coming months related to any power shortages, as well as economic challenges. But based on the better-than-expected results we saw in the first quarter, our Japan sales plan for the year now calls for just a modest total sales decline in dollars and a roughly similar decline in comps in yen with no significant variability in the second, third and fourth quarters.", "And we expect October sales -- others, I'm sorry, our other sales to increase about 25%. We are now planning to open 19 new customer operated stores this year and in Japan, we reduced our locations by one, representing an overall 8% increase in our worldwide store base. We were previously forecasting 21 new stores for this year, but one in the U.S. and one in Europe have been delayed until next year. In Europe, we now plan to open 4 stores this year including second stores in Z\u00fcrich and Frankfurt, as well as a store in Neuss. In Asia-Pacific, we plan to open 8 stores and in the Americas, we plan to open 7 stores including a recently opened stores in Calgary and Northbrook, as well as stores in Richmond and the fashion show mall in Las Vegas among others. ", "Also in the U.S., later this year, we are planning to relocate one of our stores in the Boston area from the Atrium Mall to a smaller and we believe better location at the nearby mall at Chestnut Hill. ", "In terms of margin assumptions for the full year, we expect the operating margins to improve about 0.5 point, excluding non-recurring items, coming from improvement in both the SG&A ratio and gross margin, primarily tied to sales leverage on fixed costs. ", "As everyone knows precious metal and diamond costs increased dramatically in 2010, and it continued to move higher this year. We plan to continue to take price increases in various categories and across various country locations to offset the higher costs, and we also expect other expenses, net, of about $45 million and an effective tax rate of 34%. But based on these better-than-expected first quarter results, our full year outlook now calls for our earnings per diluted share to increase 18% to 21% to a range of $3.45 to $3.55 per diluted share, not including the nonrecurring expenses of about $0.19 per share. ", "Our previous outlook calls for EPS in a range of $3.35 to $3.45 per share, which also did not include the nonrecurring expenses. We noted in today's news release that worldwide sales growth so far in the second quarter is continuing to exceed our expectation with a solid performance in those regions. ", "In addition to the new store openings I mentioned, we will have an active line up of new product introductions highlighted by the new Tiffany locks collection, which is enjoying a very strong start. Other new designs include Tiffany Twist, a new collection in 18 karat gold and sterling silver, and we are excited about the revival of Elsa Peretti's bottle collection of pendants, which was her first jewelry design and is now offered in an expanded and distinctive assortment. And we will continue to expand our marketing communications to customers and reinforce Tiffany's brand message, in exciting and new markets through both print and digital media. ", "I'll close by saying that these first quarter results were a great way to start the year and we certainly have reasons to be optimistic about the future. ", "Thank you for listening to our call today and please feel free to call Mark with any questions and please note on your calendars that we expect to report Tiffany's second quarter results on Friday, August 26. And that concludes today's call.", "Operator", "A replay of today's call will be available starting today, May 26, 2011, at 10:30 a.m. through June 2, 2011, 11:30 p.m. You can access the replay by dialing replay (888) 203-1112 or (719) 457-0820, and enter pass code 3168288.

(NYSE:TIF) Q2 2011 Earnings Call August 26, 2011  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Patrick McGuiness - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President", "James Fernandez - Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President", "Mark Aaron - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's Tiffany & Co. Second Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark Aaron", "Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's conference call for our review of Tiffany's second quarter results and the outlook for the rest of the year. Jim Fernandez, who most of you know and who recently became Tiffany's Chief Operating Officer, is also on the call, and we're pleased to be joined by Pat McGuiness, who was recently appointed Tiffany's Chief Financial Officer.", "Before continuing, please note Tiffany's Safe Harbor provision that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's 2010 annual report on Form 10-K, and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.", "Now we can proceed. On our conference call 3 months ago, we characterized Tiffany's first quarter results as outstanding due to 20% sales growth and 39% earnings growth, excluding non-recurring items. The second quarter results that we reported today deserve at least a similar superlative description. We achieved strong and better-than-expected sales growth in all geographic regions, with worldwide sales up 30%. That enabled us to gain considerable leverage on expenses and achieve a solid improvement in the operating margin when excluding non-recurring charges and record a 58% increase in net earnings, excluding those non-recurring items.  EPS of $0.86 excluding the non-recurring items was well above our expectation, and also above analysts' expectations. Please refer to today's news release for further details of those non-recurring items.  These results were a further indication of strength in the luxury industry, and we again raised our full year outlook based on the better-than-expected results. ", "Let's now review sales by segment. In the Americas, total sales rose 25% due to a higher average price per unit sold as well as unit growth in most product categories. In fact, sales increased in all price strata above $250, with notable strength in sales over $20,000 and $50,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, comparable store sales rose 23% on top of a 5% increase last year. Comps increased by double-digit percentage in all 3 months. Please note that in the future, while we will continue to disclose comps on a quarterly basis for each geographical segment, we will no longer discuss monthly intra-order trends because of our focus on longer-term performance.", "Within the Americas, the sales growth was obviously led by our stores in the U.S., but we also had good growth in our stores in Latin America and Canada. Sales in our New York flagship store surged 41% on top of an 8% increase last year, with a substantial increase in sales to foreign tourists and the remaining portion of the increase due to higher local customers sales. That 41% increase was sharply higher than the comps we saw in our 8 other New York area stores. Comparable Americas branch store sales increased 19% on top of a 4% increase last year. ", "Geographically, U.S. sales growth was pretty broad-based, although there was greater strength in the Western half of the U.S., and our 6 stores in Hawaii and Guam continued to show very strong sales growth due to Japanese tourist spending. In fact, from a customer perspective, roughly half of our U.S. sales increase in the quarter came from higher spending by foreign visitors, increasingly led by Chinese travelers. The benefit from sales to foreign tourists is most meaningful in New York flagship store as well as in certain of our stores in Florida, Las Vegas and California. ", "During the quarter, we opened our fourth store in the important Chicago market in Northbrook, Illinois and our fourth company-operated store in Canada in Calgary, Alberta.  Rounding out the Americas, our e-commerce and catalog sales, which rose 16% on top of a 2% decline last year due to increases both in the number of orders and in the average size per order.", "Turning to the Asia-Pacific region. Sales increased 55% in the quarter due to roughly equal increases in both the number of units sold and in the average price per units sold. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 45%, and comparable store sales rose 41% on top of a 7% comp increase last year. Sales were strong throughout the quarter and in most countries, with especially strong growth in the Greater China market as well as in Korea. We're also very pleased with performance from new stores. The store count was unchanged in the quarter, but we recently opened 2 new stores in Korea this month and had a number of openings scheduled for the next few months. And earlier this month, we completed a dramatic renovation and expansion of our store on Collins Street in Melbourne. ", "Looking at Japan, our business there continued to show improvement that began a month after the tragic earthquake and tsunami in March. Total sales in Japan in yen in the quarter rose 8%, entirely due to 8% comp growth that was on top of a 7% comp decline last year. When translated into dollars, total sales in Japan rose 21% in the second quarter due to an increase in the average price per unit sold, which benefited from the stronger yen, which averaged JPY 80 to the U.S. dollar in the second quarter versus JPY 90 last year. We were pleased to see that sales growth was geographically broad based throughout Japan and that the sales trends improved as the quarter progressed. The store count held steady during the quarter.", "Sales in Europe continued at a strong pace for the second quarter. Total sales increased 32%, largely due to unit growth in all categories as well as a smaller increase in the average price per unit sold. European currencies have strengthened against the dollar, which means that in constant currencies, total sales increased 17% while comps rose 11% due to solid performance throughout the quarter. This was on top of a 21% comp increase in last year's second quarter.", "Geographically, comps range from good growth in our U.K. stores to even stronger growth on the continent. While the largest portion of our sales growth in Europe was to local customers, the results have been a noticeable increase in sales to foreign tourists, especially from China and Russia. The new stores we opened last year in London's Canary Wharf and Barcelona are performing very well. And during the quarter, we opened second stores in both Frankfurt and Z\u00fcrich in their airports. Rounding out the segment review for sales are other sales, which increased 46% in the quarter due to similar growth in the wholesale sales to independent distributors in emerging markets and wholesale sales of rough diamonds.", "From a merchandising perspective, our 30% worldwide sales growth in the quarter was generated by double-digit percentage increases in all jewelry categories. High-end statement jewelry sales were robust in the quarter. Engagement jewelry sales were very strong due to substantial increases in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and Europe coming from growth in both units and average price. The fine and fashion jewelry categories were strong, led by well-known designs like Tiffany's Metro, Notes, Keys, Return to Tiffany and 1837 collections as well as our successful Celebration Rings and the relatively new Yellow Diamond Collection. In essence, we enjoyed broad-based strong growth in diamond jewelry and gold jewelry sales, and we also had a reasonably good increase in silver jewelry sales, including continued growth in the Americas.  And designer jewelry sales were up nicely, led by the designs of Elsa Peretti. We introduce a multitude of new designs every year, and 2011 is no different, with a strong lineup of new products, including the new Tiffany Locks collection, Tiffany Twist and Elsa Peretti's bottle collection of beautiful pendants. And we are excited about the upcoming launch of Paloma Picasso's Venezia collection. ", "Let's now look at the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin increased 1.2 points in the second quarter to 59%. This was entirely due to sales leverage on the fixed costs that are in cost of sales. Rising commodity prices have compelled us to take selective retail price increases on various product categories and in most regions this year. These higher diamond and precious metal costs are obviously affecting everyone in the industry and resulting in price increases. As we said before, our objective is to maintain gross margin on our product. Based on these sales results, we continue to believe in our ability to pass along the higher costs without diminishing our competitive position.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 37% in the second quarter. A meaningful portion of that SG&A expense growth was due to $34 million, or $0.16 per share after tax, of non-recurring expenses for the relocation of our New York headquarters staff, which was completed in June. Those expenses are primarily related to the fair value of the remaining non-cancelable lease obligations, reduced by the estimated sublease rental income as well as accelerated depreciation of property and equipment in our former locations, incremental rent and payments related to terminated leases. ", "In last year's second quarter, we recorded $3.7 million of non-recurring relocation expenses. By and large, we pretty much recorded all the non-recurring expenses related to the headquarters relocation. Excluding those non-recurring costs, SG&A expenses rose 26%, largely due to higher store occupancy costs, increased staffing, higher marketing spending and sales-related variable costs. After reducing marketing spending in 2009 due to external conditions, we have since been increasing the marketing-to-sales ratio toward a previously higher level in 2008 as we enhance brand awareness in existing and new markets. ", "The ratio of SG&A expenses to sales increased 2.1 points in the quarter, but excluding the non-recurring items from SG&A expenses this year and last year, the ratio would have improved by 1.4 points, showing the strong effect from sales leverage on fixed costs. Other expenses net of $9.6 million, which was primarily interest expense, were modestly lower than last year. And an effective tax rate of 31.2% in the quarter came in lower than the 34% rate last year, primarily due to a reversal of the tax valuation allowance. ", "Putting it all together, net earnings rose by a substantially better-than-expected 33% in the second quarter. Excluding the non-recurring items in both years, net earnings increased by an even stronger 58%. Return on average assets and return on average stockholders' equity were 11% and 19%, respectively. ", "And I'll now turn the call over to Jim.", "James Fernandez", "Thanks, Mark. As many of you are aware, we have invested substantially in our infrastructure over the past decade to strengthen Tiffany's sourcing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, and I continue to be actively involved in that process. I would like to highlight the key initiatives. As a major jeweler selling high-quality diamonds, we have built an organization that has significant wide-ranging abilities to source our needed diamond supply. That does not offset the almost 40% increase in rough diamond prices in the past year that we are experiencing, but it does strongly help us from a supply perspective. ", "The outlook for diamonds over the long term certainly looks as though rising global demand will continue to put pressure on supply and, therefore, price. Our organization must continue to be proactive in maintaining strong relationships with diamond producers, which may also continue to include providing some financial support when necessary to ensure greater supply. ", "A recent example of this strategy is our providing financing for the expansion of the Koidu mine in Sierra Leone in return for a supply agreement earlier this year. Similarly, we have developed extensive internal capacity and capabilities for finished goods manufacturing, which last year produced 60% of the products we sold. Our 3 facilities in New York and 1 in Rhode Island have been successfully supporting our growing product needs. And last year, we expanded production into Lexington, Kentucky and earlier this week, moved from a temporary space there into a newly constructed 25,000 square-foot facility that will ultimately employ about 125 people. We have 2 major distribution centers in New Jersey, one which ensures that our store inventories are replenished in a timely way and the other efficiently fulfilling direct shipments to customers. Both of these facilities have capacity to support our planned business expansion for many years to come.", "One of the reasons that the expansive infrastructure I've just described supports our business so effectively is because of the investments we have made in information technology. We have developed what I believe is a world-class organization, both in terms of people and system capabilities, providing technology supporting our business from customer-facing transactions to distribution to inventory management. All of these supply chain, distribution and IT strengths support our store base, our e-commerce and wholesale distribution and will enable us to further expand our geographical reach. In addition, the relatively fixed-cost nature of this infrastructure will enable us to continue to improve our operating margin. And thanks to our real estate services group, we are now fully settled into our new headquarters at 200 Fifth Avenue, relocating our organization with a major project that involved the collaborative efforts of numerous people, and we now stand to benefit from organizational efficiencies and cost savings. ", "All in all, Tiffany's operating capabilities are strong, and we are well-prepared to withstand our business over the long term. As we announced in June, Pat McGuiness has assumed the position of Chief Financial Officer from me. Pat has been effectively in charge of most finance division functions for several years now. And he and I have worked closely, and we'll certainly continue to do so. ", "I'm pleased to now introduce Pat to offer some comments about our balance sheet and financial outlook.", "Patrick McGuiness", "Thanks, Jim. I certainly agree with you that Tiffany has strong operating capabilities and that our financial strength provides an additional key element of support and competitive advantage. Looking at our balance sheet at the end of the second quarter, we had $565 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We had $694 million of short-term and long-term debt, and our total debt to stockholders' equity was 29% at July 31 versus 40% a year ago. We're using that strong balance sheet in several ways. ", "An 18% year-over-year increase in net inventories at the end of the quarter supported sales growth, new stores and new products. We are expanding our statement jewelry inventory assortment in key markets around the world, and we are being opportunistic in purchasing greater amounts of rough diamonds. Also contributing to the inventory growth were higher product acquisition costs, and almost 1/4 of the inventory increase came from the translation effect of stronger foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar. As a result, we expect net inventories to increase at least 15% this year. ", "Accounts receivable at quarter end were 16% higher than a year ago due to strong sales growth, but it also includes some effects from foreign currency translation. Capital expenditures of $111 million in the first half of the year were up from $51 million last year. We continue to expect that CapEx will come in at approximately $250 million for the full year versus $127 million in 2010. This increase is due to a higher number of store openings, a greater number of store renovations and the relocation of our New York headquarters. ", "CapEx this year will likely represent almost 7% of sales. This is pretty consistent with our longer-term CapEx outlook of 6% to 7% of sales. We were also using some cash for share repurchases. We spent nearly $25 million in the second quarter to buy approximately 330,000 shares at an average cost of $74.29 per share. We have spent $52 million in the first half of the year to purchase about 783,000 shares at an average cost of $67 per share. We have approximately $340 million of remaining repurchase capacity under the currently authorized program that runs through January 2013. We plan to maintain a strong balance sheet and higher-than-normal cash balances while continuing to invest in the business and return capital to shareholders. ", "Now let's review our financial outlook for the full year. This updated outlook incorporates the better-than-expected results from the second quarter and August trends while maintaining our expectations for the remainder of the year. As Jim discussed on the conference call 3 months ago, enough macroeconomic uncertainty remains, and we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. Therefore, our outlook is not premised upon the continuation of such strong comparable store sales increases that we achieved during the second quarter. ", "Our full year forecast now calls for a high-teens percentage increase in worldwide net sales. By region, we are looking for sales in the Americas to increase by a high-teens percentage with local currency comps up by a mid-teens percentage, sales in Asia-Pacific to increase by at least 30% with local currency comps up close to 25%, sales in Japan to increase by a high single-digit percentage in total with a low single-digit comp increase in yen and sales in Europe to increase by at least 20% with local currency comps up by low-double-digit percentage. We expect other sales to increase about 25%. We will increase our worldwide store base by 7% this year, which includes opening 17 company-operated stores, and closing one in Japan. ", "In the Americas, we will now open 6 stores this year. This includes stores already opened in Calgary and Northbrook as well as stores scheduled to open in the Stony Point mall in Richmond, the Fashion Show Mall in Las Vegas, the Iguatemi department store in Brasilia and the second store in Vancouver in the Oakridge Centre. A store plan for Montreal is now scheduled to open at the beginning of fiscal 2012. We will also soon relocate one of our stores in the Boston area from the Atrium Mall to the nearby mall of Chestnut Hill. ", "In Europe, we are adding 3 stores this year, including the stores we've opened in Z\u00fcrich and Frankfurt as well as a second store in Milan opening next month. The planned opening of a store in Neuss has been slightly delayed into early 2012.  In Asia-Pacific, our plan continues to include opening 4 stores in China, 1 in Taiwan and 3 in Korea, 2 of which have recently opened. Our margin assumptions for the year also factor in the better-than-expected second quarter results. We now expect the operating margin to improve by more than a full point, excluding non-recurring items, coming from improvement in both gross margin and the SG&A expense ratio, both of which are tied to sales leverage on fixed costs. ", "We continue to expect other expenses net of about $45 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 34%. So we are now forecasting full year earnings per diluted share in a range of $3.65 to $3.75 per diluted share, not including non-recurring expenses of about $0.20 per share. Our previous outlook called for EPS in a range of $3.45 to $3.55 per share, which also did not include the non-recurring expenses. ", "This new forecast represents a 25% to 28% increase over last year's $2.93 per diluted share, which also excluded non-recurring items. We noted in today's news release that worldwide sales growth so far in the third quarter is continuing to exceed our expectations, with noteworthy strength in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and Japan. This is especially encouraging in light of the recent and well-known stock market volatility.

(NYSE:TIF) Q3 2011 Earnings Call November 29, 2011  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Mark L. Aaron - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Patrick F. McGuiness - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Tiffany & Co.'s third quarter conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark L. Aaron", "Thank you, everyone, for joining us. On today's conference call, Pat McGuiness, Tiffany's Chief Financial Officer, and I, will review Tiffany's third quarter results and the outlook for the rest of the year.", "Before we continue, please note Tiffany's Safe Harbor provisions that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.", "Now let's proceed. Following a robust first half of the year, we are very pleased this morning to report strong third quarter results. As an overview, the 21% worldwide sales growth, or 17% on a constant-exchange-rate basis, exceeded our expectations to the solid performance in most regions that demonstrate the advantage and opportunities for us from an increasingly [indiscernible] of stores and customers.", "The operating margin rose 3.5 points due to excellent SG&A expense leverage. As a result, net earnings rose 63%; and earnings per diluted share were $0.70 in the quarter, up from $0.43 per diluted share last year. Excluding nonrecurring items last year, net earnings still rose by a strong 52%. And despite global economic uncertainties, we slightly raised our full year earnings outlook to reflect some of the better-than-anticipated third quarter performance.", "Now let's look at the details of the quarter, starting with a regional sales review. In the Americas, total sales rose by a better-than-expected 17% due to an increase in the average price-per-unit sold. In addition, we continue to see unit sales growth in all price strata above $250, with notable increases at the highest price points. One example of the stronger activity at the high end was the great success of our annual Blue Book event for top customers held in October.", "On a constant-exchange-rate basis, comparable store sales in the Americas rose 15% on top of a 5% increase last year. Broadly speaking, our stores in the U.S. performed well, as did our stores in Latin America and Canada. Sales in our New York flagship store rose 24% versus a 3% decline last year, with most of that large increase due to sales from foreign tourists.", "Conversely, sales growth in New York area brand stores was more modest, as it reflects a higher percentage of local customer demand. In fact, the sizable portion of our total U.S. sales increase in the quarter came from sales to foreign visitors, particularly to customers from Asia and to a lesser extent from Europe, but there was also good increase in sales to U.S. customers. On a side note, if you are in New York, we invite you to be charmed by our especially festive holiday windows of our Fifth Avenue flagship store.", "Comparable Americas brand store sales increased 13% on top of an 8% increase in last year's third quarter. It's worth noting that geographically, the 13% branch store comp increase reflected much greater strength than the Western half of the U.S. including markets like Texas and California, as well as very strong sales growth in Hawaii and Guam driven by Japanese tourist spending. ", "We opened 3 stores in the Americas in the quarter: including one in Richmond Virginia, our fourth store in Las Vegas and our third location in Brazil, in the Iguatemi department store in Brasilia.", "    ", "Combined Internet and catalog sales in the Americas increased 11% on top of the 7% increase last year largely due to an increase in average sales per order and the smaller increase in the number of orders shipped.", "On a related note, we were pleased to see it recently reported that L2, a think tank for digital innovations ranked Tiffany highest in their digital IQ index in the jewelry and watch categories. L2 cited digital confidence as a point of differentiation for our brand because we offer a website that is searchable, shareable and mobile-optimized, and at high social media efforts to a broader digital strategy. I can share with you that we plan to further enhance our social media program, and dramatically revamp our website next year to derive strong marketing and sales benefits.", "Now let's turn to the Asia Pacific regions. Total sales in the quarter surpassed our expectations by surging 44% due to similar growth in both the number of units sold and in the average price-per-unit sold. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 40%, with comp store sales up 36% on top of 11% comp increase last year. The Asia Pacific sales growth was strong throughout the region, with especially strong double-digit growth in the Greater China market, but also noteworthy increases in Australia and Singapore.", "In the quarter, we opened 3 Asia Pacific stores: including 2 in Korea, in Daegu and Incheon; and 1 in China, in Guangzhou. As well as relocating our very successful store within the Wynn Resort in Macau. We are on track to open 3 additional Asia Pacific stores planned in December in China, Taiwan and Korea.", "Our business in Japan performed a bit better than we expected in the quarter. Total sales in yen rose 3% due to 4% comp growth, versus a 2% comp decline last year. When translated into dollars, factoring in the yen being 9% stronger than last year's third quarter, total sales in Japan increased 12% entirely due to an increase in the average price-per-unit sold. Sales growth is pretty consistent between the Tokyo area and other regions. The store count in Japan was unchanged at 55 in the quarter.", "In Europe, total sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis increased 15% in the quarter, while comparable store sales rose 6% on top of the 24% comp increase last year. Including translation effect, total sales in Europe in dollars rose 19% in the quarter, largely due to unit growth and a modest increase in the average price-per-unit sold.", "There was a noticeable difference in performance between Continental Europe, highlighted by double-digit comps in France, Germany and Italy versus a modest decline in U.K. comp sales. While Europe is facing challenging economic conditions, we have attributed Tiffany's better performance in some countries to our growing brand awareness and market penetration. Having said that, we are certainly not implying that Tiffany will be completely insulated from these economic challenges.", "In addition, although a clear majority of our sales in Europe are to local customers, European sales have been increasingly benefiting in a few countries from growing sales to foreign tourists, notably from China and Russia.", "In the third quarter, we opened Tiffany's second store in Milan, in the Excelsior, which now gives us 5 stores in Italy. And we were excited to recently announce that Tiffany will open a store in Prague in 2012, in addition to other planned openings.", "Beyond the retail store performance I've just discussed, I should add how pleased we are with the performance of our websites in Europe, Asia Pacific and Japan. These websites are generating e-commerce sales and, along with additional informational sites that we have in some Asia Pacific countries, are also proving to be very effective marketing tools to drive customers to our stores.", "Lastly, sales in our other segments declined 19% in the quarter due to lower wholesale sales to independent distributors in emerging markets and modest decline in wholesale sales of rough diamonds. So that covers sales by segment. Let's now take a brief look at some product category highlights.", "The 21% worldwide sales growth from the quarter was quite broad-based, with solid percentage gains across the key jewelry categories, ranging from our iconic classics to new designs. This included strong growth in engagement jewelry sales, especially in the Americas and Asia Pacific, and as I alluded to earlier, very healthy increases in high-end statement jewelry sales. We also saw significant increases in our fine and fashion jewelry categories, with stronger growth at higher price points. This was typified by the classics in platinum and diamonds, such as studs and pendants, as well as strong gold jewelry sales; while silver jewelry sales posted more modest growth.", "Popular jewelry designs at higher price points include the Victoria collections, our beautiful yellow diamonds collections, Tiffany Metro and, of course, our Celebration Rings. While a couple of popular collections that span more moderate price points include the Return to Tiffany and 1837 collections.", "The Keys Collection remains one of our top sellers across its wide range of price points, and this year's introduction of Tiffany Locks collection is already proven to be very successful. Designer jewelry sales posted a good increase in the quarter highlighted by the introduction of Paloma Picasso's new Venezia Collection. And outside of jewelry, we have been expanding our relatively new leather collection with more designs, as well as distributing into more of our U.S. stores. So we are certainly pleased with the wide range of merchandising success in the quarter.", "Let's now review the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin came in at 57.9% in the third quarter versus 58.5% in the year-ago period. The decline was largely due to a shift in the sales mix. We saw a strong growth in higher-priced diamond jewelry that earns a lower gross margin, but of course, contributes substantial gross profit dollars that generate incremental sales leverage on SG&A expenses. And gross margin was also marginally reduced by higher commodity costs despite the price increases we've taken this year.", "Precious metal and diamond costs appeared to have stabilized or even slightly declined in the recent months, but we will not attempt to predict future near-term move. Most importantly, we continue to believe at our competitive ability to pass along the higher costs without diminishing our relative market position.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 10% in the quarter, excluding $6 million of nonrecurring costs in last year's third quarter tied to the New York headquarter's relocation. SG&A expenses rose 12% year-over-year, largely due to higher store occupancy costs and increased staffing and sales-related variable costs. Those same factors, as well as higher marketing spending, contributed to a 21% increase in year-to-date SG&A expenses, or 18% excluding nonrecurring items.", "We continue to achieve excellent sales leverage on fixed SG&A costs in the quarter. On the adjusted basis, to exclude nonrecurring items, the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales in the quarter improved by 3.2 points to 40.1%, while in the year-to-date, the ratio improved by 2 points to 39.5%.", "While adding up the third quarter's strong sales growth with increased gross profit and contained SG&A expense growth, earnings from operations rose 50% over last year, and excluding nonrecurring items were up 41%. Other expense net, which is primarily interest expense, was $10.4 million in the quarter. That was somewhat lower than last year. The effective tax rate of 33.9% in the quarter was in line with our expectations and compared with 34.9% last year.", "Bottom line, third quarter net earnings rose 63% to almost $90 million, and with $0.70 per diluted share. Excluding nonrecurring items, net earnings increased 52%. So we consider these third quarter results to be quite good and presume most of you will agree with that assessment. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Pat McGuiness, to review balance sheet highlights and our outlook for the rest of the year.", "Patrick F. McGuiness", "Thanks, Mark. And good day to everyone. The third quarter was encouraging with strong sales and earnings growth, and the company continues to generate strong returns, with the return on average assets running at 12% and return on average stockholders' equity at 21%. We are pleased with this strong demand and equally pleased that we are well-positioned with an efficient infrastructure and strong balance sheet to move forward.", "On our balance sheet, at the end of the third quarter, we had $297 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Short-term and long-term debt totaled $709 million, representing 31% of stockholders' equity at October 31 versus 38% a year ago. We view our strong balance sheet as a competitive advantage, especially in times of macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties. Combined with an efficient supply network, we are able to maintain high inventory availability in our stores. Net inventories at the end of the quarter were 25% higher than a year ago, due to a 58% increase in combined raw materials and work-in-process inventories, as well as the modest 8% increase in finished goods inventories.", "Overall, the increases supported sales growth, new stores and new products. The increase also reflected significantly higher production acquisition in raw material costs. Part of the increases, as we have forecasted at the start of 2011, has been to expand our statement jewelry assortments in key markets to create additional sales opportunities. We have been purchasing greater amounts of rough diamonds in support of sales growth and to secure a supply for our expanding internal production. I should add that only a couple percentage points of the inventory increase resulted from the translation effects of stronger foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar.", "We expect net inventories at year end to increase roughly 15% above the prior year end. On a related note, we are pleased with the start-up of a new jewelry manufacturing facility that we opened a few months ago in Lexington, Kentucky. That additional capacity is nicely complementing our existing locations in the New York area and Rhode Island, and positions us well to continue to expand internal production.", "Now moving to the rest of the balance sheet. Accounts receivable are in excellent shape, declining 5% in the past year, reflecting a decline in receivables owed by independent distributors. Our capital expenditures were $182 million in the first 9 months of the year, compared with $89 million in the same period last year. We continue to expect that CapEx will come in at approximately $250 million for the full year versus $127 million in 2010. The delta is a function of store openings and a greater number of store renovations, but it also reflects the buildout of our new headquarters.", "As we continue to expand our business, we are also returning some cash to stockholders. We have been repurchasing our common stocks steadily and opportunistically. In the third quarter, we spent $86 million to buy approximately 1.3 million shares at an average cost of $65.37 per share. In the first 9 months of the year, we have spent $139 million to purchase about 2.1 million shares at an average cost of $65.97 per share.", "At quarter end, we had $250 million of remaining repurchase capacity under the current re-authorized program that runs through January 2013.", "Now let's turn to our forecast for the year, which mostly reflects some fine-tuning of assumptions from our previous guidance, as well as the better-than-expected third quarter results. For the full year, we are still forecasting a high-teen percentage increase in worldwide net sales to approximately $3.7 billion. That annual forecast implies a low-teen percentage increase in worldwide sales in the fourth quarter. We highlighted our full year sales assumptions by regions in today's New York news release.", "Those full year assumptions imply that in the fourth quarter by region, we are looking for sales in the Americas to increase by a low double-digit percentage, with local currency comps up by mid to high-single digit percentage; fourth quarter sales in Asia Pacific to increase by more than 20% with local currency comps up around 20%. Total sales in Japan to increase by mid-single-digit percentage in the fourth quarter with a low-single-digit comp increase in yen. And for sales in Europe in the fourth quarter to increase by mid-teens percentage with local currency comps up by a low-single-digit percentage. And we expect that other sales will decline about 10% in the fourth quarter.", "By year end, we will have increased our worldwide store base in 2011 by 6%, or 4% growth in square footage, which reflects adding a net of 14 company-operated stores. A few locations originally planned to open in 2011 were delayed due to construction and site availability beyond our control, which will contribute to a higher rate of store expansion planned for 2012.", "In the Americas, we have added 5 stores during the year. This includes 3 stores in the U.S.: in Northbrook, Richmond and Las Vegas; 1 store in Canada, in Calgary; a store in Brasilia, which now gives us 3 stores in Brazil. We recently relocated one of our stores in the Boston area from the Atrium Mall to the nearby Mall at Chestnut Hill. And we are getting ready to open the second store in Vancouver.", "In Europe, we have added 3 stores this year: in the airports in Z\u00fcrich and Frankfurt, as well as the second store in Milan.", "In Asia Pacific, we have opened 3 stores with 3 more planned in the fourth quarter in China, Korea and Taiwan. Two additional stores originally planned for China in the fourth quarter have been delayed into early 2012. And year-to-date, in Japan, we have opened 1 new store, while closing 2 other locations.", "We still expect the operating margins to increase by more than a full point for the year, coming mostly from SG&A expense leverage. This implies an operating margin in the fourth quarter roughly equal to last year. We're looking for full year other expenses of about $43 million and an effective income tax rate of approximately 34%.", "Adding it all up, our forecast now calls for full year earnings per diluted share in the range of $3.70 to $3.80 per diluted share. This excludes a $0.20 per share of nonrecurring expenses that we have already recorded. This EPS range would be up 26% to 30% from last year's $2.93 per diluted share, which also excluded nonrecurring items. We are previously forecasting EPS in the range of $3.65 to $3.75 per share, which also did not include the nonrecurring expenses. This implies fourth quarter net earnings in the range of $1.48 to $1.58 per diluted share. As we noted in today's news release, worldwide sales growth, so far in this fourth quarter, is meeting our expectations despite recent weakness in Europe as well as in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic markets of the U.S.", "Although it's probably too early to draw any conclusions, we are cognizant of the challenging economic conditions and uncertainties in a number of markets, and believe we have factored a reasonable degree of caution into our latest forecast.", "In closing, we have every reason to be pleased with Tiffany's performance so far in 2011. We are well positioned in this holiday season and over the longer-term horizon; the Tiffany & Co. brand remains strong; customers are increasingly attracted to our well-designed, high-quality products; our stores have strong inventory positions; we have a well-developed and efficient infrastructure; and we have a solid balance sheet to pursue our expansion plans.", "That concludes my comments, please feel free to call Mark with any questions. And please note on your calendars that we expect to report Tiffany's holiday period results on Tuesday, January 10. Our best wishes to you during the holidays, and thank you for listening.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, please note that today's conference has been recorded and will be available for replay beginning at 10:30 a.m. Central Time today, and remain available until 10:30 Central Time on December 6, 2011.

Kowalski - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Member of Management Board, Member of Corporate Social Responsibility Committee and Member of Dividend Committee", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Tiffany & Co. Fourth Quarter Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. Participating on today's call will be Mr. Mike Kowalski, Chairman and CEO; Mr. Pat McGuiness, Senior VP and CFO; and Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Aaron. Please go ahead.", "Mark L. Aaron", "Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us on this call. Pat McGuiness and I will review fourth quarter and full year results as well as the company's outlook for 2012, and then Mike Kowalski will wrap up the call with some remarks. ", "Before we continue, please note Tiffany's Safe Harbor provision that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's 2010 annual report on Form 10-K and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.", "Now let's proceed. One year ago, we reported broad-based strong financial results for fiscal 2010 with sales up 14% and net earnings from continuing operations up 39%. We are now pleased to also report strong performance for fiscal 2011, with net sales up 18%, net earnings up 19% to $3.40 per diluted share and net earnings excluding nonrecurring items up 24% to $3.60 per diluted share. ", "At the same time, we are disappointed that the year finished on a softer note than we initially expected, with fourth quarter sales up 8%, net earnings down 2% and net earnings excluding nonrecurring items down 4%, but that does not diminish our satisfaction from achieving another successful year. And it's worth noting that the $3.60 per diluted share of earnings in 2011 excluding nonrecurring items was above the initial guidance we provided to you one year ago that called for $3.35 to $3.45 per diluted share. ", "Let's first review some key sales highlights by region for the fourth quarter and full year. Sales in the Americas increased 5% in the fourth quarter, with comp store sales up 3% on top of an 8% comp increase last year. This was a slight improvement from the 4% increase in November, December holiday sales that we had previously reported. The 5% sales increase in the fourth quarter was due to an increase in the average price per unit sold. In fact, while price stratification for the Americas in the fourth quarter indicated continued declines in sales and transactions below $250, it was more than offset by sales growth in most of the higher-priced categories. It was a pretty similar dichotomy for the full year, with the greatest strength in sales over $20,000 and $50,000. ", "We believe that the slower sales growth in the Americas in the fourth quarter might have been in varying degrees due to restrained spending by customers employed in the financial sector, which especially affected our sales in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S., substantial competitive discounting and particular softness at our entry-level silver jewelry price points that might be tied to some resistance to price increases among other factors. ", "Sales in the New York flagship store rose 2% in the quarter, which was a bit better than the 1% decline in the holiday period. The 2% increase was due to higher sales to foreign tourists. The overall Americas region also benefited from higher sales to foreign tourists but also saw increased sales to local customers. Comp store sales in branch stores rose 3%, with growth somewhat skewed toward the western half of the region, which includes continued strong growth in Hawaii and Guam, driven by Japanese tourists. Our stores in Canada and Latin America posted solid sales growth in the quarter.", "For the full year, sales in the Americas rose 15% due to an overall increase in the average price per unit sold. Growth in jewelry units sold at higher price points was offset by declines in the silver jewelry category. The Americas region represented 50% of worldwide sales versus 51% in 2010. Americas comps rose 13% in the full year. Sales in the New York flagship store rose 20% in 2011 and remained at 8% of worldwide sales. ", "In 2011, more than 40% of sales made in the New York flagship store were to foreign tourists versus somewhat less than 40% in 2010. Americas branch store comps rose 11% in 2011 on a constant exchange rate basis due to strong increases in most parts of the U.S. as well as in Canada and Latin America. ", "I mentioned that higher foreign tourist spending generated a good portion of the fourth quarter sales growth in the U.S. That reason also applied to the full year. In fact, full year sales to foreign tourists represented an estimated 23% of U.S. sales in 2011 versus 17% and 15% in 2010 and 2009. European, Japanese and Chinese tourists represented roughly similar amounts of that spending in 2011. ", "The 5 highest-volume branch stores in the Americas in 2011 included 3 in the U.S. and 2 in Canada, and they are South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, California, San Francisco and Chicago as well as in Vancouver and on Toronto's Bloor Street. We opened 6 new stores in the Americas in 2011, including one in Richmond, Virginia, a fourth store in Las Vegas in the Fashion Show Mall, a fourth store in the Chicago market in Northbrook, a store in Calgary, a second store in Vancouver in the Oakridge Centre and a third store in Brazil in Brasilia. Their results range from quite good to very strong, and that follows excellent first-year results from the 5 Americas stores we opened in the previous year. ", "We finished 2011 with 102 stores in the Americas, including 87 in the U.S., 5 in Canada, 7 in Mexico and 3 in Brazil. Rounding out the Americas are Internet and catalog sales, which declined 4% in the fourth quarter as an increased amount per order was more than offset by a decline in the number of orders shipped. Internet and catalog sales rose 6% in the full year due to increased sales per order and accounted for about 10% of sales in the Americas for the year. We continue to believe that our Internet presence serves the dual purpose of generating online sales and expanding brand awareness, which drives traffic to our stores. We are currently in the process of revamping our website with some exciting enhancements that will debut later this year. ", "Tiffany's second-largest region by sales is Asia-Pacific. Sales rose 19% in the fourth quarter due to increased units sold and a smaller increase in the average price per unit sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales for the quarter rose 18% with growth in most countries and especially in Australia, Hong Kong and Macau contributed to a 13% increase in comp store sales. That was on top of a 16% comp increase in last year's fourth quarter and was basically in line with the previously reported November, December sales results. ", "For the full year, total Asia-Pacific sales rose 36% due to similar increases in units and in the average price per unit sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, sales rose 31%, and comp store sales rose 27% on top of a 14% comp increase in 2010, with strong increases in most countries.", "Asia-Pacific represented 21% of worldwide sales in 2011 versus 18% in 2010. Sales in Greater China represented 12 points of the 21%. We have a meaningful opportunity to achieve much higher brand awareness in China, and as we proceed, we should undoubtedly see the benefits through sales growth in China as well as in other markets serving the growing numbers of Chinese tourists. ", "During the year, we opened 6 stores in Asia-Pacific, including 3 in Korea, in Seoul, Daegu and Incheon; 2 in China, in Guangzhou and Dong Cheng; and one in Taiwan, in Taichung. And their early results are good. We also did a major renovation and expansion, which doubled the size of our very successful store on Collins Street in Melbourne. We ended 2011 with 58 stores in the Asia-Pacific region. Our 2 largest stores by sales volume in the region are on Canton Road in Hong Kong and in Ngee Ann City in Singapore. ", "Now let's turn to Japan. Total sales rose 12% in the fourth quarter due to an increase in the average price per unit sold. This was essentially in line with the 13% sales increase in the holiday period. On a constant exchange rate basis, sales rose 5% in the quarter and comps rose 4% on top of a 1% increase last year due to relatively similar growth throughout Japan. ", "One year ago this month, we were looking at a sales decline and considerable uncertainty in Japan following the tragic earthquake and tsunami. But our sales growth resumed one month later, demonstrating the enduring value and emotional resonance of our brand combined with the extraordinary efforts of our Tiffany colleagues in Japan. For the year, on a constant exchange rate basis, total sales increased 3% and comparable store sales rose 4%. However, due to the yen strengthening by 10% against the U.S. dollar in 2011, total sales increased 13% due to an increase in the average price per unit sold. ", "Our flagship store on the Ginza in Tokyo generates the highest volume of our stores in Japan and accounted for 12% of our total retail sales in Japan last year. During 2011, we opened a new store in Hakata and closed 2 locations in Kokura and Wakayama and finished the year with 55 locations in Japan. For the full year, Japan represented 17% of worldwide sales in 2011 versus 18% in 2010.", "Now let's review performance in Europe. Sales in the fourth quarter increased 3% due to an increase in the average price per unit sold. This was slightly better than the previously reported holiday sales result. On a constant exchange rate basis, sales rose 3% and comp store sales declined 2% on top of the 16% comp increase on last year's fourth quarter. The 2% comp decline reflected mixed results that range from solid growth in Continental Europe, with the highest growth in Germany and Austria, to a sales decline in the U.K.  ", "For the full year, sales in Europe increased 17% due to increases in units sold as well as in the average price per unit sold and continue to represent 12% of worldwide sales. On a constant exchange rate basis, total European sales rose 12% and comp store sales rose 6% on top of an 18% comp increase in 2010. Strong sales growth across Continental Europe surpassed a more modest increase in U.K. sales in the year. We think that softness in London has probably reflected restrained spending by customers in the financial industry, similar to what we've experienced in New York, along with overall challenging economic conditions. ", "The vast majority of our European sales are generated by local customers. However, Tiffany stores in Europe also derive a growing benefit from sales to non-European tourists, which we estimate now represent about 1/4 of European sales, with the highest percentage of those sales in Paris. In addition, Tiffany's Internet sales in Europe through websites in 9 countries are also growing very nicely and represented almost 10% of total European sales in 2011.", "During the year, we opened 3 stores in Europe, including a second store in Milan, in the Excelsior, which is posting excellent initial results, as well as second stores in both Frankfurt and Z\u00fcrich, in their airports. And I should add that we've had excellent results from the 2 stores we opened in 2010 in London's Canary Wharf and in Barcelona. ", "The U.K., with 10 stores, accounted for slightly less than half of our European sales in 2011. Our 2 highest-sales-volume stores in Europe in 2011 were on Old Bond Street in London and on via della Spiga in Milan. We operated 32 stores in Europe at the end of 2011. ", "Putting it all together, our solid sales growth contributed to improved sales productivity in 2011 coming from comp store sales growth and the successful results from new stores. Looking at that sales productivity by region, the 247 stores we operated in 21 countries at year end generated total worldwide sales per gross square foot of $3,000 in 2011 versus $2,600 in 2010. ", "By region, the Americas generated $2,300 in 2011 versus $2,100 in 2010. Europe generated $3,400 versus $3,000 in 2010. Japan was at $4,100 versus $3,500 in 2010. And the highest productivity continued to be in Asia-Pacific, with $4,700 per gross square foot versus $4,000 in 2010. ", "Let's briefly look at other sales, which declined 22% in the fourth quarter. That segment consists primarily of wholesale sales of diamonds and sales to independent third-party distributors of our products, primarily in the Middle East and Russia, and the sales decline reflected lower sales in both components, as we had expected. For the full year, other sales declined 5% as sales growth to independent distributors was more than offset by a decline in wholesale sales of diamonds. ", "We recently announced that we have signed a memorandum of understanding with Damas Jewelers to establish a joint venture in the UAE. The JV will give us overall responsibility for 5 existing stores in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and we will soon commence new merchandising and marketing initiatives there to drive sales growth. ", "Let's now review some merchandising highlights. While total sales growth decelerated to 8% in the fourth quarter after increasing 24% in the first 9 months of the year, there were some differing patterns by category and price point in some regions. High-end statement jewelry sales softened after experiencing strong growth in the first 3 quarters of 2011. On the other hand, the most resilient category was engagement jewelry, with a very solid increase in the quarter, continuing its strong growth from earlier in the year. Fine and fashion jewelry sales were up modestly in the quarter after strong growth in the first 3 quarters of the year. We are extremely pleased with the continued success of our extraordinary yellow diamond jewelry collection and with its long-term potential. ", "We've also seen customers all year attracted to platinum- and diamond-focused products, such as studs and pendants, and to important collections, such as Victoria, Metro and Celebration Rings. There's also been a growing desire for gold jewelry in collections like Return to Tiffany, 1837 and the new Locks Collection, which followed the unprecedented success of the Keys Collection. Conversely, silver jewelry sales have been growing more modestly. ", "We were pleased with growth in designer jewelry sales in the quarter that continued our success from earlier in the year. Elsa Peretti's designs had a healthy sales increase, led by the always alluring Diamonds by the Yard collection. Paloma Picasso sales growth was stimulated by her stunning new Venezia Collection, and we are also continuing to be pleased with the sales growth of Tiffany's Leather Collection. ", "Product development has always been an important strategy and sales driver at Tiffany's, and you can expect to see a very exciting and eclectic array of new jewelry designs over the coming year. ", "I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Pat McGuiness.", "Patrick F. McGuiness", "Thanks, Mark. I will now focus my remarks on the rest of the earnings statement. Let's start with gross margin, which at 60.4% in the fourth quarter was 0.5 point lower than the prior year. The downward pressure in the quarter came from higher product cost, a continued shift in sales mix toward higher-priced products that earn a lower gross margin, and a lack of sales leverage on fixed cost. ", "For the full year, gross margin of 59% was 0.1 point lower than the prior year. Higher product acquisition costs and shifts in product sales mix were mostly offset by sales leverage on fixed costs. Throughout the year, we have spoken about gross margin pressure from significantly higher cost of precious metals and diamonds, which, in turn, have led to increased retail prices at Tiffany and in the overall jewelry industry. If product input costs stabilize, we would expect less pressure on gross margin in the latter part of 2012, and future pricing actions, if any, would be more modest. For the full year, though, we expect gross margin to be lower than the prior year based on our assumptions for product cost, inventory turnover, sales volume and sales mix. ", "Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10% in the fourth quarter primarily due to growth in store occupancy, labor and marketing costs. In last year's fourth quarter, we recorded $6 million of nonrecurring expenses related to the relocation of our New York headquarters staff in June 2011. Excluding that expense, SG&A expenses increased 11% in this fourth quarter, and the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales would have been 36.3% versus 35.1% last year. For the full year, SG&A expenses rose 18%. This is also primarily due to higher cost for store occupancy, labor and marketing. ", "SG&A expenses also included $43 million of nonrecurring expenses in the first half of 2011 related to the headquarters staff relocation. In 2010, we recorded $17 million of those nonrecurring expenses. So excluding nonrecurring expenses in both years, SG&A expenses increased 16% for the year, and the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales improved to 38.4% from 39.2% in the prior year. ", "We will remind you that the vast majority of our SG&A expenses are relatively fixed, in fact, about 80%. So there's further opportunity to leverage those costs and improve the ratio to sales. For 2012, we believe we have put together a well-controlled and prudent expense plan. Our plan calls for high-single-digit expense growth, which includes increased spending for new stores, labor, occupancy and marketing. Our plan will enable us to improve the expense ratio to sales for the full year. Excluding nonrecurring charges, the improvement will be comparable or better than the 80-basis-point reduction achieved in 2011. The SG&A expense growth in 2012 also factors in higher pension and post-retirement costs due to asset performance and a reduction in the discount rate. ", "For the full year, the slight decline in gross margin and the improved SG&A expense ratio gave us an operating margin of 19.4% versus 19.3% last year. However, excluding nonrecurring items, the operating margin was 20.6% versus 19.8% last year. For 2012, the expected decline in gross margin and improvement in the SG&A expense ratio will likely result in the operating margin being unchanged from 2011 to 20.6% excluding the nonrecurring items. ", "Other expenses rose to $13 million in the fourth quarter from $11 million last year, while other expenses in the full year declined to $43 million from $47 million due to lower interest expense. We expect other expenses in 2012 to be roughly unchanged from 2011. The effective income tax rate of 34.5% in the fourth quarter was a bit higher than we anticipated, which cost us a few cents per share in the fourth quarter. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 came in at 34%. That was higher than the 32.7% rate in fiscal 2010, which included benefits from nonrecurring items primarily related to a change in tax status of certain subsidiaries. We are projecting an effective tax rate of 34% to 35% for 2012. ", "Adding it all up, net income declined 2% in the fourth quarter to $178 million or $1.39 per diluted share. For the full year, net earnings rose 19% to $439 million or $3.40 per diluted share. Excluding nonrecurring items, net earnings declined 4% in the fourth quarter but rose 24% in the full year to $3.60 per diluted share. Due to the higher-than-expected effective tax rate, this was at the lower end of the range we had projected when we reported holiday sales results on January 10. The full year net margin rose to 12.1% in 2011 from 11.9% in 2010. Excluding the nonrecurring items, net margin was 12.8% in 2011 versus 12.2% in 2010. ", "Whichever way you measure it, Tiffany had a very strong year, and earnings surpassed the healthy objective that we set at the start of 2011. Our return on average equity and return on average assets improved in 2011. ROE was 19% for the full year versus 18% in 2010, while ROA was 11% for the full year versus 10% in 2010. While the improved ROA reflects the strong earnings in 2011, it also reflects a large increase in inventory levels, which I'll discuss in a moment. ", "We finished the year with a solid balance sheet that we believe serves as a competitive advantage. Accounts receivable of $184 million at year end was 1% below the prior year end, and receivable turnover remained very high at 20x. Net inventories of $2.1 billion at January 31 were 28% higher than the prior year end, but it's important to look at the components of that increase. ", "Finished goods inventories rose 16% in fiscal 2011, reflecting higher product acquisition costs, new stores, product launches and expanded product assortments, including our statement jewelry category.  And the lower-than-expected sales growth in the fourth quarter temporarily inflated year-end inventory levels. It's worth noting that the larger driver of inventory growth was in raw material and work-in-process inventories. Combined, they increased 46% in the year, reflecting higher product acquisition costs, increased internal manufacturing and substantially higher rough and polished diamond purchases. ", "For 2012, we are planning for a 15% increase in net inventories, partly due to new stores, expanded product assortments and further vertical integration of our diamond supply chain. The inventory growth also includes a meaningful increase of extraordinary statement jewelry pieces to support the celebration of Tiffany's 175th anniversary over the 2012, 2013 timeframe. ", "Capital expenditures were $239 million in 2011 or 7% of sales. This was substantially higher than the $127 million we spent in 2010. The largest single piece of the CapEx increase resulted from the relocation of our New York headquarters staff. We also increased our CapEx by renovating more of our store base, and CapEx also went toward opening 14 stores. Our CapEx budget of $240 million for 2012 reflects both a higher rate of new store openings and an increased number of store renovations. The budgeted amount represents about 6% of sales and is consistent with the long-term plan to spend about 6% to 7% of sales per year. ", "As a result of the factors I've cited, Tiffany's 2011 free cash flow, which we define as cash flows from operating activities minus capital expenditures, was an outflow of $29 million. At year end, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $442 million, total short-term and long-term debt was $712 million, and stockholders' equity was $2.3 billion at year end. As a result, the ratio of total debt to equity was 30% at year end compared with 32% at the end of fiscal 2010 and 40% at the end of fiscal 2009. In 2011, we paid off $61 million of maturing long-term debt in Japan. We also entered into a JPY 4 billion or about $50 million one-year credit facility in Japan, which was fully utilized at year end. ", "During the year, we continued returning cash to stockholders. We remained active in our share repurchase program in 2011, spending $174 million to repurchase 2.6 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $66.23 per share. And once again, we increased the quarterly dividend rate on common stock, announcing a 16% increase in May 2011. That represented the 10th dividend increase in 9 years, which has also led to a meaningful increase in the dividend payout ratio over that period. The annual dividend of $1.16 per share represents a payout ratio of 34% on 2011's earnings per share of $3.40. ", "Looking to our financial guidance for 2012. We stated in today's news release that we are projecting an approximate 10% increase in worldwide sales in 2012 primarily driven by sales growth in Asia-Pacific and the Americas. Our expected 10% worldwide sales increase in dollars equates to a 12% increase on constant exchange rate basis with comp store sales growth of 8%. ", "I've already mentioned our full year assumptions for gross margin, SG&A expense growth, other expenses and the effective income tax rate. Bringing it all together, we are projecting net earnings for 2012 in a range of $3.95 to $4.05 per diluted share, representing growth of 10% to 13% over 2011 EPS of $3.60 per diluted share, which excluded the nonrecurring items. ", "As we noted in today's news release, we expect a large portion of the earnings growth to be weighted toward the fourth quarter. The unusual spread is largely due to our expectation for some continued gross margin pressure in the next few quarters. We also noted in today's release that we are now halfway through the first quarter, and worldwide sales growth is tracking in line with our internal expectation. ", "We know there are economic challenges and uncertainty in a number of markets around the world, as evidenced by the fourth quarter results, and we believe we have factored a reasonable degree of caution into our forecast. However, we also continue to take a long-term approach to managing our business and are striving to increase Tiffany's presence and customer base. Our 2012 plan includes making those investments to reap both immediate and longer-term benefits. ", "I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Mike Kowalski.", "Michael J. Kowalski", "Thanks, Pat and Mark. I'm glad to be on this call and pleased to say that we achieved, if not exceeded, the objectives we set for 2011. We generated strong sales and earnings growth for the year despite the softness in the fourth quarter, and we continue to build an even stronger platform for future growth. The new stores we opened and the new products we introduced performed well, and we have exciting plans for 2012. Specifically, one of our key initiatives will be the continued expansion of our company-operated worldwide store base. Our plan for 2012 is to open a net of 24 stores, representing a 10% increase in the number of locations. ", "In the Americas, we are planning to open 9 stores, comprised of 4 stores in the United States, including a store we are opening this week in Salt Lake City and a store in Manhattan SoHo in September.  We are planning for 2 new stores in Canada, including one we opened last month in at Montr\u00e9al, and we are planning to open 3 stores in Latin America, with 2 in Mexico and 1 in Rio de Janeiro. ", "In Asia-Pacific, we plan to open a net of 7 stores this year, including one store in Bondi Junction, Australia, our sixth in Australia; our second store in Singapore at the airport, which will be our fifth store in Singapore; and a net of 5 stores in China, bringing us to 21 stores in China by year end. Our plans continue to call for expanding our store base to 30 stores in China in the next several years. In Japan, the store total will be unchanged. ", "Our plans for Europe call for adding 3 stores this year in Prague, in Nice and in the Berlin airport, which will bring us to 35 European stores by year end and closer to our goal of 50 stores in Europe in the next 5 or so years. ", "Our worldwide store expansion plans in 2012 also include adding 5 company-operated stores in the Middle East. Two months ago, we announced our signing of a memorandum of understanding to establish a joint venture in the UAE with Damas Jewelers. Under the JV, Tiffany will soon take on responsibility for merchandising, assortment and pricing, advertising and promotional activities, staffing, store design and visual display and financial services in 5 existing Tiffany company stores, including 3 in Dubai and 2 in Abu Dhabi. We are very excited about converting these stores into company-operated locations and believe there is substantial potential for us to reach a large base of customers who undoubtedly appreciates Tiffany's extraordinary product offerings. Beyond the Middle East, we are also exploring opportunities to expand Tiffany's modest existing presence in Russia and Brazil and to eventually enter India. ", "Tiffany's website has been widely recognized for its innovative excellence in the jewelry category. We believe we can enhance the customer experience even further and are working on a comprehensive revamp of the website to launch later in the year, which we expect will generate additional marketing and sales benefits. ", "We also have developed an exciting and impactful array of new products to be introduced in 2012. I'm sure you are all aware that Tiffany's 1837 jewelry collection has been an enormous success. To commemorate the year of Tiffany's founding, we are excited about the current launch of the next generation of 1837, with new designs in gold and silver and a significant portion of the collection executed in Tiffany's new RUBEDO metal. RUBEDO is a luminescent blend of copper, silver and gold, which our metallurgists took several years to develop. It has a radiant, innovative glow, and initial customer reception has been very strong. We plan to further expand our assortment of statement jewelry with important pieces, and we'll continue to offer our extraordinary engagement jewelry in a compelling and competitively dominant assortment of styles. ", "Beyond engagement and statement jewelry, we have developed a new Enchant Collection for later this year with designs inspired by the natural world in platinum, gold and tanzanite. There will also be new designs featuring pink diamonds, a continued focus and expansion of our very successful Yellow Diamond Collection, additions to our Somerset jewelry collection and new pearl jewelry offerings. And we will debut a new collection of designs inspired by the Art Deco period to coincide with the fourth quarter debut of the movie The Great Gatsby, for which Tiffany has designed the jewelry. We are also currently launching Paloma Picasso's new Villa Paloma collection in gold and silver, inspired by the beauty found in Paloma's favorite gardens around the world. ", "Finally, we will continue to build on the strength of our core collections with additions to our very successful Return to Tiffany, Keys, Locks and Charms collections and new additions to our Leather Collection. And of course, you can be certain that we will employ an active marketing program through advertising and print and digital media, public relations and store events to focus on these new designs as well as the wide range of Tiffany classics. ", "Supporting our ongoing business and store and product expansion is our strong infrastructure. Tiffany's 2 distribution centers are very effectively handling worldwide store replenishment and direct-to-customer shipments. Very importantly, we have developed excellent product manufacturing and sourcing capabilities. In 2011, we internally manufactured about 60% of Tiffany's merchandise sold. The new jewelry manufacturing facility we opened in Lexington, Kentucky in 2011 gives us additional capacity to complement our facilities in New York and Rhode Island and can support our future growth. ", "Tiffany has built an extraordinarily powerful diamond supply chain through relationships with many of the world's diamond producers. Less than 1% of the world's diamonds meet Tiffany quality standards. As we continue to seek global wealth creation in the future, we and others in our industry expect that the worldwide supply of diamonds, especially at our quality levels, keep pace with growing customer demand, and therefore, diamond cost will likely move higher. While we cannot mitigate higher cost, we can feel assured that the diamond supply chain we have developed will enable us to serve our growing customer base with a comprehensive supply of the finest-quality diamonds that they expect from Tiffany. ", "The 2012, 2013 period marks the 175th anniversary of Tiffany's founding. Our brand is now globally recognized and admired. 54% of our worldwide sales in 2011 were transacted outside the United States, and the percentage of sales made to non-U.S. customers is even greater if you include the spending by foreign tourists shopping in our U.S. stores. ", "Tiffany will continue to grow as the place that customers from around the world come to celebrate life's most important occasions. The Tiffany & Co. brand is flourishing because it represents the finest product quality and craftsmanship, enduring value, a rewarding shopping experience and a bond of trust with consumers. We know that these traits will remain the keys to our future growth and our success. ", "We believe we have put together a reasonable and achievable financial plan for 2012 with approximately 10% worldwide sales growth and net earnings growth of 10% to 13%, excluding last year's nonrecurring items. What we accomplish in 2012 should yield benefits for years to come, and we remain committed to our longer-term financial objective to increase net sales by 10% to 12% annually and net earnings by at least 15% per year. ", "Thank you for joining us today for our review of Tiffany's results and outlook. I look forward to seeing many of you during the year and updating you on Tiffany's progress. In fact, please note that we expect to report Tiffany's first quarter results on Thursday, May 24. I appreciate your ongoing and growing interest. Here's Mark again.", "Mark L.

(NYSE:TIF) Q1 2012 Earnings Call May 24, 2012  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Mark L. Aaron - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Patrick F. McGuiness - Chief Financial officer and Senior Vice President", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Tiffany & Co. First Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Participating in today's call are Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations; and Mr. Pat McGuiness, Senior Vice President and CFO. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead.", "Mark L. Aaron", "Good day, everyone. Pat McGuiness and I appreciate your tuning in for this review of Tiffany's first quarter results and an update of our full year outlook. Before we continue, please note Tiffany's Safe Harbor provision that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's 2011 annual report on Form 10-K and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Now let's proceed.", "The first quarter results we reported this morning were mixed. Total sales growth of 8% was a few percent below our expectation due to softness in April, but you should note that it was on top of a 20% increase on last year's first quarter. The shortfall to our expectation was entirely in the Americas while quarterly sales in Asia Pacific, Japan and Europe came in pretty much where we expected.", "Gross margin declined in the quarter, which we had anticipated, and SG&A expenses were in line with our expectation. Put it together and net earnings rose slightly over last year on a GAAP basis but declined slightly when adjusted to exclude nonrecurring costs last year. You should also note that net earnings in last year's first quarter had increased by a strong 26%.", "We had clearly communicated 2 months ago that we expected only minimal EPS growth when adjusted in the first quarter, and that we anticipated that most of the expected annual increase in 2012 would occur in the fourth quarter. Pat will address our new annual outlook in his remarks.", "Let's begin the sales review by looking at the Americas, where total sales rose 3% in the quarter. The increase was due to a higher average price per unit sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, sales also rose 3%, and comps were equal to last year due to a 1% increase in brand store comps, with no meaningful geographical differences by region except for strength in our Pacific market and a 4% decline in New York flagship store sales.", "In last year's first quarter, Americas comps had increased 17% due to a 15% increase in brand store comp and a 23% increase in New York flagship store sales. In any case, both the brand stores and New York comps trailed our expectations.", "We believe that our performance in the U.S., while disappointing to us, is also reflective of data published by MasterCard spending polls for the high-end segment of the U.S. jewelry industry.", "On our last call, we identified a number of factors that we believed affected sales in the Americas, ranging from restrained spending by customers employed in the financial sector to substantial competitive discounting, which we believe has continued, to particular softness in entry-level silver jewelry price points tied to resistance to price increases. We think those factors are all still relevant.", "In addition, the first quarter finished on a softer note that we attribute to a difficult year-over-year comparison to strong growth in April 2011, which may have been related to at least some degree to the timing of Mother's Day, which occurred on May 8 last year and May 13 this year.", "In terms of customer mix, it was higher foreign tourist spending that drove the modest Americas sales increase in the quarter versus suspending by domestic customers. In fact, our stores in Hawaii and Guam saw the largest increase. Conversely, we noted that foreign tourist spending in the New York flagship store was equal to the prior year, as increased sales to Asian visitors were offset by lower sales to Europeans and other tourists.", "In the Americas region beyond the U.S., sales were up in Canada and we had strong sales growth in Mexico, where we have 8 stores, and Brazil, with our 3 stores. We added 3 stores in the Americas in the first quarter, including one in the newly opened City Creek Center in Salt Lake City, one in Montr\u00e9al in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel and one in Mexico in the Palacio De Hierro's Interlomas department store. Six more stores in the Americas are planned for later this year.", "Lastly, combined e-commerce and catalog sales in the Americas rose 1% in the quarter due to an increase in the average sales per order. The increase was slightly below our expectation but came on top of a 14% increase last year.", "Let's now turn to the Asia Pacific region, which posted a solid 17% sales increase in the first quarter that was virtually in line with our expectation and was mostly due to increased unit volume, as well as some increase in the average price per unit sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales rose 16% with double-digit sales increases in most countries. Local currency comp store sales rose 10%, despite going up against a substantial 26% increase last year.", "While we acknowledge that sales growth trends in China for Tiffany, as well as others in the luxury industry, have decelerated from the extraordinarily strong rates last year, due to both difficult comparisons and some softening in economic growth, we certainly remain enthusiastic about Tiffany's long-term sales growth potential with that important consumer segment. During the quarter, we opened our 17th store in China in Wuhan and are planning to add 7 additional Asia Pacific stores later in the year.", "Turning to Japan. Total sales rose 15% in the first quarter due to an increase in the average price per unit sold, as well as a decent increase in unit volume. Excluding the translation effect of the yen, which was 2% stronger than a year ago, total sales in yen rose 13% in the quarter and comp store sales rose 12%, which exceeded our expectation.", "In last year's first quarter, we were affected by the tragic earthquake and tsunami, which led to a temporary drop in sales in March and a 3% comp decline for the quarter. Sales growth had resumed a month later, and it has continued to increase since then. And the 12% comp growth in the quarter reflected healthy increases across Japan, although with somewhat greater strength in the Tokyo region. During the quarter, we relocated one of our stores from within one department store to another in Tokyo's Shinjuku district, but the total number of stores we operate in Japan remained at 55.", "Economic conditions in Europe are obviously less than ideal, but we achieved a somewhat better-than-expected 3% sales increase in the quarter due to an increase in the average price per unit sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, total European sales rose 7% and comps were equal to the prior year, which was on top of a 15% comp increase in last year's first quarter.", "Geographically, the unchanged comp in the quarter was equally reflective of both the U.K. and overall continental Europe. Actually, the strongest sales growth was in Germany while in London, the softest store, not surprising to us, was in the Royal Exchange in the city, which caters to customers employed in the financial industry. The European store count remained at 32 in the quarter.", "Rounding out the sales review is other sales, which declined 14% in the quarter due to lower wholesale sales to independent distributors, as we prepare to commence operations of stores in the UAE. We are pleased to have finalized our joint venture agreement with Damas Jewellery, and through that JV, we'll assume operating control of the 5 Tiffany stores in Abu Dhabi and Dubai later in the second quarter.", "That covers the sales review by segment. On a worldwide basis, our price stratification analysis in the first quarter indicated no meaningful differences in rates of sales growth by price point. From a global merchandising perspective, there were a few highlights worth mentioning.", "We continue to achieve a healthy increase in engagement jewelry sales. Growth in fine and fashion jewelry sales reflected the enormous appeal of our Yellow Diamond Collection, as well as the popularity of gold jewelry. And we're very pleased with initial customer reaction to our recently updated 1837 collection, which showcases the new RUBEDO metal.", "Growth in designer jewelry sales reflected the success of Paloma Picasso's designs, including her new Villa Paloma and her Venezia Collection. And beyond jewelry, we're pleased with the sales momentum of our leather goods collection. There are additional introductions to the pipeline for later in the year.", "That wraps up the sales review. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Pat.", "Patrick F. McGuiness", "Thank you, Mark. As you just heard, first quarter sales, mostly in the Americas, were a bit below what we had initially expected. As a result, we have adjusted our expectation for the next couple of quarters. It probably goes without saying, but those sales results certainly do not affect any of our exciting plans for store expansion, product launches or the pursuit of market share growth opportunities in 2012.", "Looking at the rest of the income statement. Gross margin declined by 1 point in the quarter to 57.3%. The decline was based on higher product acquisition costs from last year, as we had expected and previously communicated. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 9% in the quarter. Excluding roughly $8 million of nonrecurring costs in last year's first quarter related to the relocation of our New York headquarter staff, SG&A expenses rose 11% year-over-year due to higher labor, occupancy and marketing spending, all of which resulted in an increase in the ratio of SG&A expenses to sales.", "Other expenses, net of $10.5 million in the quarter, were virtually unchanged from the prior year, and the effective tax rate in the quarter came in as expected at 34.5% versus 35.6% last year. Adding it up, net earnings rose 1% in the quarter. However, excluding last year's nonrecurring costs, net earnings declined 5% versus our expectation for a slight increase, due to the sales shortfall in the Americas.", "Looking at our balance sheet. Accounts receivable are in good shape, increasing 3% at April 30 from a year ago, with receivables turning at 20x per year. The more significant use of working capital has been in net inventories, which at April 30, were 27% higher than a year ago. Part of that overall increase was due to higher product acquisition costs.", "In addition, the 16% year-over-year increase in finished goods was due to store openings and expanded product assortment, and of course, some effects from the softer-than-expected sales growth. The larger increase in inventories was in raw material and work in process, up 44% year-over-year, due to the continued expansion of our rough diamond supply chain and internal jewelry manufacturing. We now expect net inventory growth of about 10% for the full year versus 15% previously, as we make adjustments tied to our lowered sales expectations.", "Capital expenditures of $44 million were modestly lower than the $52 million a year ago. We bought back some of our shares during the first quarter, spending $46 million to purchase approximately 700,000 shares at an average cost of $66.42 per share. As a result of that various spending, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $343 million at April 30 and was lower than a year ago.", "Total short-term and long-term debt of $834 million was higher than a year ago and represented 35% of stockholders' equity. We continue to achieve solid returns on assets and equity with ROA running at 11% and ROE at 19% through the first quarter, and we were pleased that Tiffany's Board of Directors last week approved a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend rate. That represented the 11th dividend increase in the past decade.", "Before turning to our financial outlook for the rest of the year, I want to make sure you are all aware of the disclosure we made in our report on Form 8-K filed yesterday with the SEC regarding the potential acquisition of Elsa Peretti's intellectual property rights. Please see the 8-K filing on our website for more details.", "Now let's review our full year outlook. We indicated in today's news release that the sales in the first few weeks of the second quarter are increasing by a low single-digit percentage. We are experiencing the difficult comparisons to extremely strong growth at this time last year, especially in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions, as well as decelerating rates of economic growth in a number of countries that are affecting our results.", "Based on results in the first quarter and revisions we have made from our initial outlook for the second and third quarters, we are now expecting full year worldwide sales to increase about 7% to 8% for 2012 versus our previous 10% objective, with the strongest growth occurring in the Asia Pacific region.", "Our plans call for adding 24 Tiffany stores this year, and as you heard, we opened 4 in the first quarter. For the rest of the year, the 20 stores plan includes 6 additional stores in the Americas, with leases finalized for a store in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood, a store in Rio de Janeiro and a store on Altavista Street in the south area of Mexico City. We have 7 stores scheduled to open in Asia Pacific, with leases finalized for a store in Bondi Junction, Australia and a second store in Singapore's Changi Airport.", "We'll have 2 additional stores in Europe, with a store in Nice opening tomorrow and a store in Prague opening later this year. A store planned to open in the Berlin airport is now delayed until early 2013 due to airport construction delays. And we will soon begin to operate the 5 stores in the UAE, in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.", "We have a strong lineup of product introductions planned for this year in a wide range of materials and price points, including an Art Deco jewelry collection, tied to the launch of The Great Gatsby movie, and Tiffany's new Enchant jewelry collection, with the designs inspired by the natural world in platinum, gold and tanzanite. Those and other introductions will receive strong marketing support, both in print and digital media, to create awareness among customers.", "We now expect the operating margin for the full year to be modestly lower than last year's 20.6%, which had excluded nonrecurring items. We expect SG&A expense growth, after excluding the nonrecurring costs from last year, to be somewhat below sales growth, leading to an improvement of perhaps a 0.5 point in the ratio of SG&A expenses to sales, but being more than offset by a decline in gross margin.", "We are pleased to see precious metal and diamond costs stabilizing in recent months, which, if it continues, should bode well for gross margin by the fourth quarter and into next year, but not before then. We are not currently anticipating taking any meaningful price increases for the rest of the year.", "Also related to gross margins, I'm pleased to say that our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are operating efficiently to support our product needs in our stores and shipping to customers. We believe we have sufficient room to leverage that infrastructure capacity and receive a margin benefit based on achieving solid sales growth.", "Therefore, we now expect earnings for the year to increase to a range of $3.70 to $3.80, with all of the year-over-year growth coming in the fourth quarter. Our current expectation calls for earnings declines in the second and third quarters. You should also note that of this $0.25 per share decrease in our full year guidance, approximately $0.20 is related to a reduction in our operating expectations while $0.05 is tied to the expected cost of additional debt incurred for working capital, repayment of maturing debt and general corporate purposes.", "Our initial sales plan, primarily for the Americas, but also for Asia Pacific, did not factor in enough of the difficult year-over-year comparisons, as well as, more recently, the economic conditions in sales trends that have softened in some markets in Asia Pacific and elsewhere. We believe those conditions may remain soft for the next couple of quarters.", "As a reminder, local currency comp store sales in the second and third quarters of last year had increased 23% and 15%, respectively, in the Americas and 41% and 36%, respectively, in Asia Pacific. The adjustments we've made in our new sales outlook take into account soft macro conditions and those difficult year-over-year comparisons in the next 2 quarters.", "Despite the challenges we are addressing in 2012, I want to emphasize that we remain committed to our longer-term financial objective to increase net sales by 10% to 12% annually and net earnings by at least 15% per year. We believe that our company, now in its 175th year, is better positioned than ever to achieve greater prominence in our industry.", "Thank you for listening to today's conference call. Please call Mark with any questions, and also note that we expect to report Tiffany's second quarter results on Monday, August 27. Here's Mark to close the call.", "Mark L. Aaron", "Thanks, Pat. That concludes our remarks. But if you missed any portion of this call, a replay will be available today beginning at 10:30 a. m. Eastern Time and running through May 31.

(NYSE:TIF) Q2 2012 Earnings Call August 27, 2012  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Mark L. Aaron - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Patrick F. McGuiness - Chief Financial officer and Senior Vice President", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Tiffany & Co. Second Quarter Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. Participating on today's call is Mr. Patrick McGuiness, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations. At this time, it is my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mark Aaron. Please go ahead.", "Mark L. Aaron", "Thank you. Good day, everyone, and thanks for joining us. On today's call, Pat and I will review second quarter results and comment on the full year financial outlook. Before continuing, please note Tiffany's Safe Harbor provision that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.", "Now let's review the results. When we reported first quarter results on May 24, we indicated that worldwide sales in the first few weeks of the second quarter were increasing by a low-single-digit percentage and that we expected net earnings in the second quarter to decline from the prior year when excluding last year's nonrecurring costs. The overall results we report today were in line with those internal expectations. Net worldwide sales rose 2%, led by strong growth in Japan, while sales in the Americas, Asia Pacific and Europe were virtually equal to the prior year. And while net earnings on a GAAP basis rose 2%, adjusted net earnings declined 17% from the prior year, which was about what we expected when excluding nonrecurring costs in last year's second quarter related to the relocation of our New York headquarters staff. The year-over-year comparisons we faced in the quarter could not have been much more difficult, so it's worth reminding you that in last year's second quarter, worldwide sales had increased 30%, net earnings had increased 33% and net earnings excluding nonrecurring costs had surged 58%.", "Let's now look at second quarter sales by region. In the Americas, total sales declined 1% in the quarter. An increase in the average price per unit sold was offset by a decline in unit volume. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales were equal to the prior year, and comp store sales were down 5% on top of a 23% comp increase last year. Of that 5% comp decline in the quarter, brand store comps were down 4% on top of a 19% increase last year, with most regions performing in a relatively narrow band except for solid growth in Florida, Texas and our Pacific market of Hawaii and Guam. Sales in the New York flagship store declined 9% on top of a staggering 41% increase last year. Data published by MasterCard Spendingpulse continues to indicate weak customer spending for the entire U.S. jewelry industry and most pronounced among the high-tier jewelers.", "From a customer mix perspective, the sales decline in the U.S. in the quarter was entirely due to lower spending by local customers. While overall sales to foreign tourists were roughly unchanged from the prior year, higher sales to Japanese and Chinese visitors were offset by a decline in spending by European tourists in the U.S., which obviously affected the New York flagship store as well. Also in the Americas region, total sales rose in Canada, although comps declined, while we had strong growth in local currency comps in Latin America.", "Beyond stores, combined e-commerce and catalog sales in the Americas rose 3% in the quarter due to an increase in the average sales per order. That was on top of a 16% increase last year. I'm pleased to add that based on successful results measured both quantitatively and creatively from a test mailing of a new catalog format we did earlier this year, our catalogs will soon have a fresh new look starting with the upcoming holiday season.", "During the quarter, we added one store in the Americas when we opened our ninth store in Mexico in the Altavista neighborhood of Mexico City. In the second half of the year, we will be adding 3 stores in the U.S., 1 in Brazil and 5 in Canada, which now includes converting from wholesale distribution 4 Tiffany boutiques in Holt Renfrew department stores into company-operated locations.", "Turning to the Asia Pacific region, total sales rose 1% in the second quarter, resulting from increased unit volume with an offsetting decline in the average price per unit sold. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales increased 3%, and comp store sales in local currencies declined 5%, which compared with an extraordinary 41% comp increase in last year's second quarter. Australia posted the strongest growth in the quarter in contrast to softness in Hong Kong tied to restrained Chinese consumer spending and softness in Korea.", "We remain enthusiastic about Tiffany's longer-term potential in China, and we continued to expand our store base in the second quarter by opening our 18th and 19th stores there, one in Nanjing and the other in Shanghai's Grand Gateway mall, which represents our fifth store in that city. We have 5 additional stores on track to open in the Asia Pacific region in the second half of the year.", "Among our various regions, the strongest performance in the quarter came from Japan, where total sales rose 11% due to a healthy increase in jewelry unit volume and an increase in the average price per unit sold. In local currency, both total sales and comparable store sales rose 10% in the quarter. This came on top of an 8% comp in last year's second quarter. Sales growth was broad-based throughout Japan, with no significant variations by region. The number of Tiffany stores in Japan remained unchanged.", "Turning to Europe, total sales declined 1% in the quarter due to a modest decline in units, although mixed by category, and a small increase in the average price per unit sold. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total European sales increased 8% and comp store sales rose 2%, which was on top of an 11% comp increase in the second quarter of last year. Considering the obvious challenging economic conditions, we're pleased with our European results, although we do acknowledge that sales are getting a boost from non-European tourists who are offsetting spending declines by local customers in some markets. By market, sales growth in Germany, France and some other countries was largely offset by weakness in the U.K. and Italy. We opened one European store during the quarter when we entered the south of France with a store in Nice, and initial results are very encouraging. We plan to open one more European store later in the year.", "Lastly, other sales increased 12% in the second quarter. In addition to increased wholesale sales to independent distributors in certain markets, we assumed control in July of 5 Tiffany stores in the United Arab Emirates, 3 in Dubai and 2 in Abu Dhabi. We are now operating those stores and recording the retail sales and expenses as opposed to previously recording wholesale sales. As we expected, it will take some time for us to get that business fully up to speed, but we are pleased with initial results and very excited about long-term prospects throughout the Middle East.", "That wraps up the regional sales review. From a global merchandising perspective, most product categories posted sales that were relatively close to last year's levels. In addition, our worldwide price stratification analysis in the second quarter indicated fluctuating demand at various price point levels from which we can't draw any conclusions. Not to belabor the point, but the year-over-year comparisons were tough in pretty much all product categories and, therefore, difficult to analyze. There are quite a few exciting product introductions coming in the next few months that Pat will address shortly.", "Let's now look at the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin of 56.3% in the second quarter was 2.7 points below last year and virtually on our expectations mostly tied to higher product acquisition costs from last year as well as the lack of sales leverage on fixed costs. SG&A expenses in the quarter on a GAAP basis declined 8% from last year. However, excluding roughly $34 million of nonrecurring costs in the second quarter of last year related to the relocation of our New York headquarters staff, SG&A expenses rose but only by 1%, which was modestly below our expectation and not indicative of future increases as higher store occupancy costs were mostly offset by the timing of marketing spending. Other expenses net of $14.3 million in the second quarter were $4.6 million above the prior year. This primarily resulted from increased interest expense.", "Tiffany's effective tax rate in the quarter came in at the expected 34.6%. The prior year rate of 31.2% had reflected a reversal of the tax valuation allowance. In total, second quarter net earnings increased 2% on a GAAP basis but, excluding last year's nonrecurring costs, declined 17%, which was in line with our last forecast.", "I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Pat.", "Patrick F. McGuiness", "Thanks, Mark. While Tiffany's sales growth in the second quarter was restrained due to both macroeconomic reasons and difficult year-over-year comparisons, we were pleased that operating results met our expectations. From a balance sheet perspective, during the quarter, we took advantage of attractive interest rates to secure $250 million of long-term debt with principal payments due over a 10- to 30-year period at a coupon of 4.4%. Of the $250 million of proceeds, $60 million went toward repaying in full our 6.56% senior notes that came due. The remaining $190 million of proceeds is for general corporate purposes, including reducing short-term debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility.", "At July 31, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $367 million versus $565 million a year ago. Short-term and long-term debt totaled $940 million versus $694 million a year ago, and total debt represented 39% of stockholders' equity versus 29% a year ago. Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were in very good shape, declining 6% from the prior year, and the receivables turnover remained at a very high 18x per year.", "The largest use of cash over the past year has been in net inventories, which were up 21% from July 31 last year. By stages of inventory, there were similar rates of growth for both finished goods and combined raw material and work in process, reflecting higher product acquisition costs, new store openings, expanded product assortments and an expansion of our rough diamond supply chain and internal jewelry manufacturing. We continue to expect net inventories to increase approximately 10% for the full year, and we continue to exceed our objective for returns on assets and equity. ROA was 11%, and ROE was 19% through the second quarter.", "I now want to review the full year outlook. Starting at the top, we are now projecting net worldwide sales growth of 6% to 7% for the year versus our previous expectation of 7% to 8% growth. We moderated our sales growth expectation for the fourth quarter in Asia Pacific and the Americas to reflect lingering economic uncertainties. At the moment, we continue to compare against unusually strong growth in most regions at this time last year as well as challenging economic conditions in a number of countries. We believe we have appropriately considered those factors in our current forecast. Our full year plan now calls for adding 28 Tiffany-operated stores versus 24 previously, which are inclusive of the 13 stores we added in the first half of the year.", "In the second half of the year, we have exciting plans in the Americas to open a store in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood; a second store in San Francisco in the San Francisco Centre; a store in La Jolla, California; a store in Rio de Janeiro and a third store in Toronto in Sherway Gardens. On top of that, we recently completed an agreement to directly operate 4 existing Tiffany boutiques within Holt Renfrew department stores that were previously operated on a wholesale basis. Earlier this month, we began operation of the stores in Ottawa, Montr\u00e9al and Calgary, and we'll begin to operate a shop in their Vancouver store later in the year. In Asia Pacific, we plan to open a store in Bondi Junction, Australia, a second store in Singapore's Changi Airport and new stores in China in Harbin, Shenyang and Tianjin. And in Europe, we will soon enter the Czech Republic when we open a store in Prague next month.", "We have an attractive lineup of product introductions planned for the second half of the year, including Tiffany's new Enchant jewelry collection, with designs inspired by the natural world and crafted in platinum and diamonds with rose gold and tanzanite. At the same time, we will be expanding our assortment of yellow diamond jewelry, and we're introducing pink diamond accents to a number of our collections.", "Building on the success of RUBEDO, which we introduced in the newly designed 1837 collection launched earlier this year, we will also be incorporating RUBEDO into our iconic Return to Tiffany collection. This fall, we will be introducing a spectacular collection of new statement jewelry, and we're pleased with the recent launch of Tiffany Harmony engagement rings and wedding bands, which are currently offered exclusively in Japan.", "We've postponed the launch of jewelry designs that we created in relation to the premiere of the movie The Great Gatsby. The movie's premiere, originally scheduled for December, was recently moved to the middle of 2013, and it makes sense for our product launch to coincide with the marketing surrounding the movie's premiere. The lack of expected sales revenues for those collections should not have any meaningful effect on our fourth quarter results.", "Moving down the earnings statement, we continue to expect that the full year operating margin will be below last year's 20.6%, which had excluded nonrecurring items. That is based on assumptions for a gross margin decline and that SG&A expense growth after excluding the nonrecurring cost from last year will be roughly in line with sales growth. Product cost pressure is moderating, and we expect to soon benefit from reductions over the past year in precious metal and diamond costs. An expected year-over-year gross margin decline in the third quarter should be smaller than we experienced in the second quarter, and we expect gross margin to increase in the fourth quarter, although any product mix changes could offset some of it.", "We did not take any meaningful price increases in the first half of the year, nor do we anticipate doing so for the rest of the year. Therefore, we now expect net earnings for the year in a range of $3.55 to $3.70 per diluted share, down from our previous guidance of $3.70 to $3.80 per diluted share, with earnings declining in the third quarter, as we had previously forecast, followed by a resumption of growth in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned before, our reduced earnings forecast for the year primarily reflects a more conservative assumption for sales growth in the fourth quarter as well as the related margin effect from less sales leverage. We believe our new guidance incorporates an appropriate degree of near-term caution at this point in time.", "Longer term, our management team remains enthusiastic about the opportunities we are pursuing in store expansion, product introductions and marketing that will contribute to solid growth. The challenges we are facing this year are pretty obvious, but I want to emphasize that we remain committed to achieving our longer-term financial objectives to increase net sales by 10% to 12% annually and net earnings by at least 15% per year. We believe that Tiffany & Co. is well positioned to achieve those objectives.", "Thank you for listening to today's conference call. Please note that we expect to report Tiffany's third quarter results on Thursday, November 29. Here's Mark to close the call.", "Mark L. Aaron", "Thanks, Pat. That concludes our presentation.

Today's call is being recorded.", "Participating on today's call are Mr. Pat McGuiness, Tiffany's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark L. Aaron", "Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's conference call. Pat and I will review first quarter results and also update you on our full year plans and outlook.", "Before continuing, please note Tiffany's Safe Harbor provisions that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.", "Now we can proceed with the review of Tiffany's performance. It's safe to say that we are pleased to begin the year with better-than-expected sales and earnings. Sales growth of 9% in dollars or 13% on a constant-exchange-rate basis was driven by solid performance in Japan, Asia-Pacific and Europe, but sales in the Americas were somewhat softer than we expected. Gross margin, although below last year due to product sales mix, continued to benefit from diminishing product cost pressures, as well as price increases that we implemented during the quarter across all regions and product categories.", "SG&A expense growth was well contained in the quarter, and net earnings were up 3% on a GAAP basis. However, if you exclude expenses in the quarter tied to cost-reduction initiatives, a 10% increase in net earnings was quite a bit better than our initial expectations for decline of 15% to 20%. Please refer to our non-GAAP measures schedule in today's news release.", "We're encouraged with the start of the year, but caution you to not draw overly optimistic conclusions from the first quarter, which generates a relatively small percentage of sales and earnings in comparison with annual results.", "I'll now review sales by region. In our largest region, the Americas, total sales rose 6% in the quarter to $408 million, which was below our expectation. In fact, the 6% sales growth was entirely due to an increase in average price, while unit growth in the higher-priced statement and fine jewelry was offset by unit declines at more moderate price point categories. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales also rose 6% and comparable store sales rose 3%.", "Sales growth in the New York flagship store was higher than the region's increase as it particularly benefited from large purchases tied to our Blue Book event in April, as well as from foreign tourism, which represents almost half of that store's sales. We are no longer quantifying specific sales performance for the New York store to be consistent with the way we report performance in our other regions and as it now represents only 8% of worldwide sales.", "Elsewhere, there was mixed performance around the Americas region but pronounced softness in the Hawaii and Guam stores that reflected less Japanese tourist spending. But I'll address our business in Japan in a moment. Our sales in Canada rose in the quarter partly due to higher statement jewelry sales and partly due to the conversion of 4 locations in the second half of last year from independently operated to company-operated stores.", "Latin American sales were roughly equal to the prior year, and we did not open any new stores in the first quarter and finished the quarter with 115 stores in the Americas. In addition, changes in e-commerce and catalog sales were not significant in the quarter, and as we have said repeatedly, those media are as much about the benefits derived from marketing as they are about generating sales.", "Turning to the Asia-Pacific region. Total sales increased by better-than-expected 15% to $223 million due to increases in average price, as well as unit growth across all jewelry categories. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total Asia-Pacific sales rose 14% and comp store sales rose 9%. We saw healthy sales growth across the region, but led by particular strength in Hong Kong, Korea and Singapore.", "We opened a store in Xi'an, China in the quarter and closed 1 in Taichung, Taiwan, finishing the quarter operating 66 stores in that region. As we continue to expand Tiffany's store presence, especially in China, we're seeing the dual benefit of local sales demand as well as increased brand awareness, which generates spending by Chinese customers when they travel to other regions.", "Without a doubt, Japan sales growth in the quarter exceeded expectations more than any other region. In local currency, total sales and comp store sales rose 20% and 21%, respectively, with considerable strength in engagement jewelry and other higher-price-point categories. This was better than we expected and reflected considerably stronger growth in the latter half of the quarter.", "However, the yen was 18% weaker than the dollar in the quarter, therefore, in dollars, sales rose 2% to $145 million due to an increase in average price, while unit performance was varied, with solid increases in higher-priced jewelry categories. The yen is quoted this morning at JPY 102 to the $1. We initially planned it at JPY 93 to $1 for the year, but in light of the yen's recent movement, we have now factored in a weaker yen for the rest of the year into our earnings forecast.", "It's worth noting that we took a price increase in Japan on April 10, which, beyond addressing product cost pressures, also included an adjustment for the yen's weakness. Based on the customary pre-announcement of a price increase in Japan, it spurred purchasing in advance of the increase. However, we did not experience the typical unexpected slowdown after that. So while we believe a portion of the first quarter sales growth certainly reflects the strength of our brand, we also attribute the unusual strength to recent reports of a surge in household spending in Japan, likely tied to the Japanese government's efforts to stimulate their economy. The store count remained at 55 in Japan at the end of the quarter.", "Our stores in Europe also delivered solid results in the quarter, with total sales growing 6% to $93 million due to higher average price and unit growth across most jewelry categories. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 8% and comparable store sales rose 6%. We were pleased with sales growth across continental Europe, which more than offset some lingering softness in the U.K. Varying degrees of year-over-year performance in local demand is likely tied to economic conditions, but tourist sales have become an important factor, too, which we estimate account for more than 1/4 of our European sales. We currently operate 34 stores in Europe.", "Lastly, Tiffany's other sales tripled in the first quarter from a year ago. The magnitude of the increase largely reflects the change we made last July when we converted 5 existing Tiffany stores in the United Arab Emirates, 3 in Dubai and 2 in Abu Dhabi, from wholesale distribution to company-operated locations and began to record the retail sales of those stores. For the U.A.E. stores overall, we've increased inventory levels, improved assortments and expanded marketing activities, and we've renovated our major store in The Dubai Mall. We're pleased with initial results and believe there is substantial long-term growth potential for Tiffany in that important region.", "We finished the quarter with 275 company-operated stores. Our plan is to open 16 stores this year and close 1 store each in Japan and Taiwan, resulting in a net addition of 14 locations. And we are renovating a number of existing locations as well. In the Americas, the 6 stores planned range from 3 in the U.S., including New Jersey's Garden State Plaza and Cleveland's Eaton Center, to a store in the West Edmonton Mall in Alberta, Canada; our 10th store in Mexico in Villahermosa; and our fifth store in Brazil in Curitiba. And we are excited to be relocating our Bloor Street store in Toronto to a nearby location this fall.", "Seven stores are currently planned to open in the Asia-Pacific region, including 4 in China, one of which opened in Xi'an in the first quarter and there were 3 additional ones, which will take us to 26 stores in China by year-end. We're also working toward finalizing leases for 3 additional stores in the region. Rounding out expansion this year are 3 stores that are planned in Europe, which will bring us to 37 European stores by year-end.", "Looking at merchandising highlights in the quarter. We continue to see diverging demand among product categories by price point, with diamond jewelry clearly outperforming silver jewelry. As I alluded to earlier, we had strong growth in statement jewelry sales in the quarter, which was partly tied to the Blue Book event and our customers' response to a collection of extraordinary new jewelry pieces. At the other extreme, we continue to experience softness in silver jewelry sales, but new introductions and some greater marketing emphasis are intended to reinvigorate that category.", "In other categories, we had a healthy increase in engagement jewelry sales and are very pleased with our new Harmony collection. Fine and fashion jewelry collections were led by the continued strength of our beautiful yellow diamond jewelry; the success of our relatively new Enchant diamond jewelry; Victoria; the perennial favorite, Tiffany Keys in diamonds and in gold; and Tiffany's Metro designs. We're also excited about the response to our growing assortment of colored diamonds. These trends will illustrate our brand strategy to move toward higher-price-point categories.", "In terms of new products, we're enthusiastic about our prospects for the recently introduced Great Gatsby, Ziegfeld and Jazz collections that span a range of materials and prices. And we're looking forward to introducing our reinterpretation of our iconic Atlas collection later this year.", "That concludes my comments, so I'll turn the call over to Pat.", "Patrick F. McGuiness", "Thanks, Mark. I will also begin my remarks by saying we were pleased with these first quarter results given the overall sales strength and the improving gross margin trends. That said, we are reluctant to extrapolate a continuation of such sales trends into the second quarter and the full year, especially in light of the underlying softness in the Americas. In addition, we have factored the impact of the further weakening of the yen into our earnings guidance.", "Let's now look at the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin of 56.2% in the quarter was below last year's 57.3%, but better than we expected as higher-than-expected sales growth gave us added leverage on fixed costs. We have been experiencing a shift in sales mix toward higher-price-point products, consistent with our long-term brand strategy to achieve a lower gross margin, and we expect that to continue. However, as we anticipated, this year-over-year decline was narrower than we've seen in a while due to diminishing product cost pressure. And as Mark mentioned, we took a round of price increases during the first quarter after exhibiting pricing restraint in 2012, when we did not take any meaningful increases.", "We are introducing new jewelry designs in sterling silver this year, with more next year, with the intent to stimulate that category. But we continue to anticipate that silver jewelry sales growth in 2013 will lag growth in higher-priced categories. As a result, gross margin in the full year will be slightly lower than last year.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 8% in the quarter. This included charges tied to cost-reduction efforts of $9 million or $0.05 per diluted share for recent staffing reductions and subleasing of certain office space. Excluding those costs, SG&A expenses increased 6% due to new-store-related costs and substantial marketing costs for our Blue Book event in New York.", "Those of you in New York in mid-April may have seen the world's largest Tiffany Blue Box constructed over the skating rink in Rockefeller Center where we hosted a party for a select group of Tiffany's customers, media and celebrities. You can see some photos by visiting the press section of tiffany.com. We were very pleased with the number of significant sales generated from the event, but equally pleased with the overall customer enthusiasm and media attention.", "In addition, reported SG&A expense growth would have been 2 percentage points higher if not for the favorable translation effect primarily from a weaker yen. Our full year plan continues to call for SG&A expense growth slightly less than the forecasted sales growth. Earnings from operations rose by 1%, but were up 12% when excluding the expenses tied to cost-reduction efforts.", "Looking out to the full year, we continue to expect that operating earnings growth will be roughly in line with sales growth. Beyond 2013, there remains ample opportunity to improve the operating margin by leveraging stronger sales growth against a relatively fixed expense base. Other expenses net rose to $13 million in the quarter from $11 million last year, largely reflecting increased interest expense tied to incremental long-term debt that we took on last July. We expect other expenses to be about $58 million for the year.", "Tiffany's effective tax rate of 34.9% in the quarter met our expectation and compared with 34.5% last year. We continue to estimate a 35% effective tax rate for the year. Adding it all up, net earnings rose 3%, but were 10% above last year when excluding the $9 million of expenses tied to cost-reduction efforts. We had expected a 15% to 20% earnings decline due to product cost pressure on gross margin and the substantial marketing cost of our Blue Book event. However, the higher-than-expected sales growth, that occurred actually in the latter part of the quarter after we provided our guidance on March 22, gave us greater sales leverage on fixed cost and accounted for the delta between our expected earnings decline and the earnings growth that we ultimately achieved.", "We believe it is prudent at this time of the year to slightly reduce our sales expectations for the second, third and fourth quarters in light of our assumption for the softer sales growth in the Americas and our forecasting an even weaker yen than we had initially planned for Japan sales. Therefore, despite the better-than-expected first quarter results, we continue to expect a mid-single digit worldwide sales increase for the year, with earnings still in the range of $3.43 to $3.53 per diluted share versus last year's $3.25 per diluted share.", "This forecast excludes the $0.05 per diluted share of expenses tied to the cost-reduction efforts that we recorded in the first quarter. And I should add that we expect net earnings in the second quarter to be about equal to the prior year based on an expected mid-single digit sales increase, with stronger earnings growth coming in the second half of the year.", "Our return an average assets was 9% on a trailing basis and return on average stockholders' equity was 17%. Our longer-term financial objectives continue to call for achieving at least a 10% ROA and at least a 15% ROE.", "Let's list some balance sheet highlights. Net inventories of $2.3 billion at April 30 were only 4% above last year. Finished goods inventory was up 12% due to new stores and new products, including the expansion of our statement jewelry assortments. Combined raw material and work-in-process inventories declined 5%. We continue to project about a 5% increase in net inventories for the year. Accounts receivable at April 30 were equal to last year. Higher receivables tied to the sales growth was offset by a translation effect from the weaker Japanese yen. Receivables are turning at a rate of 21x per year.", "Capital expenditures were $35 million in the first quarter versus $44 million last year, and we are continuing to project about $230 million of CapEx for the year versus $220 million last year. We are planning for positive free cash flow of approximately $300 million in 2013 versus $109 million in 2012. At April 30, we had $465 million of cash and cash equivalents versus $322 million a year ago. Short-term and long-term debt totaled $974 million on April 30, up from $834 million a year ago, largely due to adding $250 million of long-term debt in last year's second quarter. Total debt was 37% of stockholders' equity versus 35% a year ago.", "We remain committed to returning excess cash to stockholders. In fact, 2 weeks ago, our Board of Directors approved a 6% increase in the quarterly cash dividend rate going from $0.32 per share to a new rate of $0.34 per share and representing the 12th increase in the past 11 years. The new annualized rate of $1.36 would equate to a payout ratio on our current earnings forecast in the high-30s, and we will likely maintain a ratio in the 30s going forward. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. We have $164 million available for future purchases under the currently authorized program, which expires in January 2014.", "To summarize, we are generally pleased with the start of 2013. We are introducing many exciting new product designs. We have a good lineup of new stores. Our marketing programs, including a newly designed website later in the year, are well suited to enhance customer awareness. Our infrastructure is effective in supporting our product supply needs, and we have the balance sheet to support our expansion. And most important, we are focused on maintaining and enhancing the renowned Tiffany & Co. brand around the world. I'll now turn the call back to Mark.", "Mark L. Aaron", "Thanks, Pat.

(NYSE:TIF) Q2 2013 Earnings Call August 27, 2013  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Mark L. Aaron - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Patrick F. McGuiness - Chief Financial officer and Senior Vice President", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Tiffany & Co. Second Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today's call is Patrick McGuiness, Tiffany's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead.", "Mark L. Aaron", "Thank you for joining us today. Pat and I are going to review second quarter results on this call and also take the opportunity to update you on the full year outlook.", "Before we continue, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.", "Now let's proceed with a review of Tiffany's performance. Looking at the big picture, these second quarter results were better than our expectations. Three months ago, we had forecast second quarter net earnings would be about equal to last year on mid-single digit sales growth and some lingering margin pressure. So what changed? The 4% total sales growth in the second quarter was in line with our expectation, and I should add that the increase was a stronger 8% on a constant-exchange-rate basis, with solid growth in comparable store sales in all regions outside the Americas. On the upside, however, we were pleased to see a greater-than-expected improvement in gross margin, reflecting both diminishing product cost pressures and the price increases we've taken this year. And SG&A expenses were well controlled. So adding it up, the better margin performance helped produce 16% net earnings growth in the quarter, which now leads us to increase our annual earnings guidance. And during the quarter, we launched some exciting product designs, opened 3 new stores and finalized plans for some others, which I'll talk about shortly.", "Let's now take a look at sales by region. Sales in the Americas increased 2% in the quarter to $444 million. Continuing the trend, sales growth was entirely due to an increase in average price per jewelry unit sold. A modest decline in jewelry units reflected softness in the moderate price point fashion jewelry category, which more than offset unit growth in higher-priced statement and fine jewelry.", "Comp store sales in the Americas were equal to last year and in line with our expectation. Performance varied geographically, with growth in the New York flagship store sale, tied to both increased local and tourist demand, being offset by a slight decline in comparable brand store sales. And those brand store results were mixed by market, with no discernible pattern except for pronounced softness in Hawaii and Guam, reflecting a decline in Japanese tourist sales that we believe is attributed to the weaker yen.", "Rounding out the Americas geographical review, sales were soft in Canada but we had reasonably good increases in Mexico and Brazil. Internet and catalog sales in the Americas mirrored store sales performance and we finished the quarter with 116 stores in the Americas, which included the opening of our 10th store in Mexico in Villahermosa.", "Now let's look beyond the Americas to our other regions where results were quite good. In Asia-Pacific, sales rose 20% to $208 million, which was virtually on our expectation. That 20% increase reflected unit growth across most jewelry categories and an increase in the average price per jewelry unit sold. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total Asia-Pacific sales also increased 20%, with comp store sales up by a solid 13%. The strongest comp growth was across Greater China. We finished the quarter operating 67 stores in that region, which included opening a new store in the Times Square shopping mall, marking our ninth store in Hong Kong.", "As we've said repeatedly, we believe that expanding Tiffany's store presence and marketing, especially in China, increases brand awareness and stimulates local sales demand, but also is a catalyst for spending by Chinese customers when they travel to other regions. When we analyze our performance in Japan, we believe it's most relevant, especially now, to examine sales growth in local currency because of the substantial weakening of the yen versus the dollar over the past year. And just as other foreign brands have done, we've increased retail prices in Japan this year to address that weaker yen. When measured in local currency, we're pleased that total sales rose 7% in the quarter and comparable store sales rose 8% on top of the 10% comp increase in last year's second quarter. This exceeded our expectation. The total sales growth in yen was due to an increase in the average price per jewelry unit sold. While the overall unit decline in the quarter reflected declines in moderate-priced fashion jewelry categories, it was partly offset by unit growth in engagement and higher-end jewelry.", "We believe we are partly benefiting from improved household spending that reflects consumer optimism around the Japanese government's efforts to stimulate their economy and it's possible that some of the decline in Japanese tourists spending in the U.S. could be showing up in more locally made purchases. Most importantly, we believe the overall sales growth continues to demonstrate the strength of our brand. So the good news is that sales in Japan are performing quite well, but the picture on paper looks different when considering that the yen year-over-year has weakened more than 20% versus the U.S. dollar. As a result, the 7% sales growth in yen translated into a 14% sales decline to $136 million. Our internal sales and earnings forecast for the second half of the year incorporates a yen rate roughly in line with recent levels.", "We now operate 54 stores in Japan. During the quarter, a Tiffany store in Tokyo located within the Matsuzakaya Ginza department store was closed due to the entire department store's closing for a multiyear renovation, but we are well-situated to serve their existing customers in our major Ginza store nearby and in Mitsukoshi Ginza store.", "In Europe, total sales rose 11% in the quarter due to higher average price and an increase in units sold in most jewelry categories. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales increased 10% in total and 7% on a comparable store basis, which met our expectation.", "Looking across the region, like-for-like sales growth actually accelerated in the United Kingdom and exceeded more modest comp growth in most of Continental Europe in the second quarter, after seeing the opposite pattern in the first quarter. Sales to local European customers were up in the quarter. Sales to tourists have also become a meaningful factor, estimated to represent more than 1/4 of our European sales. But there were no discernible local-versus-tourist sales patterns from country-to-country from which to draw any conclusions.", "During the quarter, we opened a store in Verona, Italy, marking our sixth store in that important country, and we finished the quarter operating 35 stores in Europe.", "Rounding out the geographical review, Tiffany's other sales increased 33% in the second quarter. July marked the first anniversary of the conversion of 5 existing Tiffany stores in the United Arab Emirates, 3 in Dubai and 2 in Abu Dhabi, from wholesale distribution to company-operated locations, and we began to record the retail sales of those stores during July 2012. We believe there is solid, long-term growth potential for Tiffany to enhance brand awareness and expand its customer base in the Middle East. We finished the quarter with 277 company-operated stores. Our plan continues to call for opening 16 stores this year, with 4 already opened in the first half of the year. We've also closed 1 store each in Japan and Taiwan, resulting in a net addition of 14 locations for the year. And of course, we're also renovating a number of existing stores.", "In the Americas, the 6 planned stores include 3 in the U.S.: in New Jersey's Garden State Plaza, which opened earlier this month; in Cleveland's Eton Center, which will open tomorrow; and a store in New Orleans, in The Shops at Canal Place. As well as our 10th store in Mexico in Villahermosa, which has opened; a store in the West Edmonton Mall in Alberta, Canada; and our fifth store in Brazil, in Curitiba. And we're excited that later this week, we will relocate our Bloor Street store in Toronto to a site 1 block away that gives us more selling space with actually less gross square footage, and will provide an extraordinary shopping environment and experience for our customers.", "The 7 new stores planned in the Asia-Pacific region this year range from 4 in China, one of which has opened in Xi'an, to the store we opened in Hong Kong's Times Square shopping mall in the second quarter and 2 other locations elsewhere. Lastly, in Europe, the 3 new stores this year include the store we opened in the Excelsior in Verona, Italy in the second quarter; as well as the store in Stuttgart, Germany in the Breuninger department store; and 1 other planned store, which will get us to 37 European stores by year-end. And we're very excited to recently announce our plans to open Tiffany's first company-operated store in Russia next year. The 4,500 square foot or 420 square meter location will be situated in the renowned GUM department store in Moscow.", "Before reviewing merchandising highlights, let me take a moment to define some categories for those of you less familiar with us. When we have been referring to fine jewelry, we are primarily talking about platinum and gold jewelry with the diamonds and/or other gemstones. Statement refers to jewelry pieces typically retailing for more than $50,000. And fashion jewelry is predominantly about non-gemstone jewelry and silver, gold and the RUBEDO metal, although small gemstones might be used as accents in some pieces. Now having provided those definitions, merchandising highlights in the quarter continued to reflect sales growth in fine and statement jewelry that outperformed the modest growth in fashion jewelry sales. Our success in higher-price-point jewelry does revolve around diamonds, including strong response to our growing assortment of colored diamonds. This range is from the statement jewelry category that had continued sell-through from April's Blue Book event and sales from our very successful Gatsby collection to solitaire diamond engagement rings, including the distinctive new Harmony collection, to the extraordinary Yellow Diamond jewelry collection, the Enchant diamond jewelry collection, our select collections with diamonds and colored stones, Tiffany Keys in diamonds and in gold and Tiffany's Metro collection. But as we've been saying recently, we're also focused on improving the fashion jewelry category, but in a luxury-brand-appropriate way. New designs, such as the Ziegfeld collection in silver, freshwater pearls and onyx that was introduced in the second quarter to strong customer response, and the reinterpretation of our iconic Atlas collection that makes its official debut on September 10, along with others in the product development pipeline, are intended to generate improving fashion jewelry sales trends over the next year.", "That wraps up my comments, so I'll now turn the call over to Pat.", "Patrick F. McGuiness", "Thanks, Mark. We were pleased with Tiffany's second quarter results in a number of ways and certainly pleased with our earnings growth. We were very satisfied with sales results in all regions, except the Americas, where sales remained quite soft. In addition, we saw a favorable gross margin movement, and we were pleased with our management of expenses. And as such, this second quarter performance leads us to raise our full year outlook.", "Now let's look at the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin was 57.5% in the second quarter compared with 56.3% last year and better than our previous guidance. We are now benefiting from a moderation in product cost, tied to product flow-through and also benefiting from a needed price increase that we took during the first quarter this year after not taking any meaningful price increases in 2012. However, these gross margin benefits are still being partly offset by a continuing shift in sales mix toward higher-price-point, lower-gross-margin products. And we took an additional price increase in Japan in the second quarter to account for some further weakening of the yen versus the dollar. We are now forecasting gross margin for the full year to be at least equal to last year. Although we are focused on improving fashion jewelry sales with new product introductions, we continue to forecast 2013 fashion jewelry sales growth to lag growth in higher-priced categories.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses rose by only 3% in the second quarter, largely due to store-related costs and marketing spending. The effect of foreign currency translation primarily from a weaker yen, reduced SG&A expense growth by about 3 percentage points. For the year, we continue to forecast SG&A expense growth slightly less than sales growth. Earnings from operations increased 14% in the quarter, and we are forecasting it to increase more than sales growth for the full year.", "There remains ample opportunity to improve the operating margin over the longer term by achieving stronger sales growth and leveraging it against a relatively fixed expense base. Other expenses, net of $15 million in the quarter, were up slightly from last year and we continue to forecast other expenses at about $58 million for the full year. The effective tax rate was 34.2% in the second quarter, and we continue to estimate a 35% rate for the full year. Adding it all together, net earnings increased 16% in the second quarter and diluted EPS rose 15%, which was considerably better than our previous forecasted earnings equal to last year. Three months ago, we had reduced our sales growth expectation for the full year due to a disappointing performance in the Americas, as well as to factor in a weaker yen. At this point, we are maintaining a cautious sales outlook for the Americas until we see solid evidence of an upturn. Our assumptions call for full year worldwide sales to grow by a mid-single digit percentage in dollars and by a high-single digit in local currency. With local currency comp growth ranging from high-single digits in Asia-Pacific and Japan to low-single digits in the Americas.", "Given these second quarter results, we are increasing our earnings forecast to a range of $3.50 to $3.60 per diluted share from the previous forecast of $3.43 to $3.53 per diluted share and last year's $3.25 per diluted share. This earnings forecast excludes $0.05 per diluted share of expenses tied to cost-reduction efforts that we recorded in the first quarter.", "We are also well-positioned with our balance sheet. At July 31, we had $490 million of cash and cash equivalents versus $366 million a year ago. Short-term and long-term debt totaled $964 million at July 31, up from $940 million a year ago. Total debt was 35% of stockholders' equity versus 39% a year ago. Net inventories of $2.3 billion, which represents about half of total assets, have increased just 4% from a year ago, with finished goods inventory up 8% and combined raw material and work-in-process inventories down 1%. Net inventories would have increased 7% when excluding the translation effect of a stronger dollar, primarily against the weaker yen. We continue to project about a 5% increase in net inventories for the year or slightly less than projected sales growth.", "Accounts receivables were 6% lower than last year, largely due to the translation effects from the substantially weaker Japanese yen. Receivables are turning at more than 20x per year. Capital expenditures were $87 million in the first half of the year versus $97 million in last year's first half, and we are continuing to project $230 million of CapEx for the year versus $220 million last year. All of this keeps us on track to achieve positive free cash flow of about $300 million in 2013 versus $109 million in 2012.", "Tying it together, our return on average assets was 10% on a trailing basis and return on average stockholders' equity was 17%. Our long-term financial objectives continue to call for achieving at least a 10% ROA and a 15% ROE. So I am pleased to say that it was a good quarter for Tiffany. Looking forward, we remain focused on a range of growth opportunities, including new product introductions and further broadening brand awareness through marketing communications. On a related marketing note, Tiffany is one of the most recognized and awarded leaders in the luxury digital space. Our passion and creativity in this area is seen within tiffany.com, as well as in our innovative social media programs, online advertising and mobile applications. Everywhere in the world, Tiffany is maximizing connectivity with our customers through all digital platforms. And to become even better, we will relaunch our website later this year with enhanced content that will be even richer and more robust in an integrated presentation. We will, of course, also be focused on expanding our global distribution and on growing comparable store sales, and we have a strong management team in place to achieve that. In fact, during the second quarter, we bolstered our global organization when we brought in experienced leaders to head 2 of our regions. For Northern America, Anthony Ledru comes to us with many years of global retail jewelry experience; and in Europe, Florence Rollet comes to us with a strong luxury background, where she had retail management responsibility across Europe. Anthony and Florence, along with our other regional leaders, report to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cumenal, our Executive Vice President who joined Tiffany 2 years ago.", "That concludes my comments.

(NYSE:TIF) Q3 2013 Earnings Call November 26, 2013  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Mark L. Aaron - Vice President of Investor Relations", "James N. Fernandez - Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Tiffany & Co. Third Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today's call is Jim Fernandez, Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer; and Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark L. Aaron", "Thank you. Greetings from our corporate offices here in New York, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. Jim and I will review results on this call and update you on our current full year outlook.", "Please first note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.", "Now let's proceed with a review of Tiffany's performance. We are pleased to report a very solid quarter with a healthy rate of worldwide sales growth and a faster rate of earnings growth. Net sales rose 7% in dollars and 11% on a constant-exchange-rate basis, with the difference primarily reflecting the substantial weakening of the yen over the past year. And on a local currency basis, sales rose in all regions.", "Operating earnings rose 31% as we benefited from a higher gross margin and SG&A expense leverage. Our effective tax rate was lower than last year. As a result, net earnings rose 50%.", "In other news, we introduced important additions to our Atlas jewelry collection. We launched our redesigned website. We announced the hiring of Tiffany's new Design Director and we opened 6 new stores.", "Let's look at sales performance by region. In the Americas, sales rose 4% in the third quarter, which was largely due to a higher average price per jewelry unit sold. A small increase in jewelry units sold included greater growth in fine jewelry, but we were pleased to see some growth in fashion jewelry, too.", "Comparable store sales rose 1%. The New York flagship store posted a solid increase, primarily resulting from higher sales to foreign tourists from China and Europe but also with modest growth in domestic spending.", "However, brand store sales were mixed by market. In the U.S., there was softness along much of the East Coast, strength along the West Coast and there were substantial sales declines in Hawaii and Guam due to lower Japanese tourist sales likely tied to the weaker yen.", "Elsewhere in the region, results were mixed in Canada, Mexico and Brazil. We opened 4 stores in the Americas during the quarter: in the Garden State Plaza mall in New Jersey; in Cleveland, Ohio's Eton Center; in the West Edmonton Mall in Alberta, Canada; and in Curitiba, Brazil, finishing the quarter with 120 stores in the Americas.", "We also relocated our Bloor Street store in Toronto to a nearby site that is providing our customers with an extraordinary shopping environment and experience. And we're delighted to be entering New Orleans when we open a store tomorrow at The Shops at Canal Place near the city's historic French Quarter.", "The Asia-Pacific region posted a strong 27% sales increase in the quarter, with broad-based double-digit comp store sales increases in Greater China and in most other markets in the region. The increase was generated by roughly equal growth in the average price per jewelry unit sold and in the higher jewelry unit sold in most categories.", "On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total Asia-Pacific sales rose 29%, with comp store sales growing 22% after a 4% comp decline last year.", "We opened a store in Jinan, China during the quarter, marking Tiffany's 24th store in China. At quarter end, we operated 68 stores in the Asia-Pacific region. In the fourth quarter, 2 more stores are planned to open in China and we are adding 2 stores in Taiwan, 1 of which opened 2 weeks ago in the Shinkong Mitsukoshi Ximen store in Tainan.", "We operate 54 stores in Japan, and our business there performed well in the quarter. In local currency, total sales increased 9% and comparable store sales rose 5%, which is on top of a 5% increase in last year's third quarter and was in line with our expectations. That 9% total sales increase was due to increases in the average price per jewelry unit sold, as well as unit growth in most jewelry categories. However, the yen has weakened more than 20% versus the U.S. dollar in the past year. So the 9% sales growth in the yen translated into a 13% sales decline in dollars.", "Beyond our growing brand strength and product desirability, we believe our sales in Japan might also be benefiting, to some degree, from the decline in Japanese tourist spending in the U.S., which might be boosting local demand in Japan.", "Our results in Europe were mixed in the quarter. Total sales rose 7% due to increases in both average price per jewelry unit sold and in the number of jewelry units sold. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 4% on a 2% comparable store sales increase that was below our expectation and was on top of an 8% comp increase in last year's third quarter.", "Within the region, for the second consecutive quarter, sales growth was led by the U.K., which more than offset softness in Continental Europe. The sales growth reflected higher local customer and foreign tourist demand, although with no discernible pattern.", "We opened a store in Stuttgart in the Breuninger department store in the third quarter, marking our seventh store in Germany, and giving us 36 company-operated stores in Europe at the end of the quarter.", "We also completed a major renovation of our Frankfurt store during the quarter and recently relocated our Florence store to a more spacious nearby site on Via Tornabuoni. One more store is planned to open in Italy before year-end.", "Lastly, Tiffany's other sales increased 14% in the third quarter, largely due to an increase in wholesale sales of diamonds that we acquire and then subsequently sell to meet our quality requirements.", "Comparable store sales rose 1%, representing the first quarter of comparability for our 5 stores in the United Arab Emirates, 3 in Dubai and 2 in Abu Dhabi, that were converted from wholesale distribution to company-operated locations in the middle of last year. We're excited about the sales growth potential for Tiffany in the Middle East to enhance brand awareness and expansion of our store and customer base.", "Complementing our store base is a strong global web presence, which now includes e-commerce in 13 countries and informational sites in a number of additional countries. And I should add that these websites are featured in 9 languages.", "Worldwide Internet sales growth, which is included in each region in the third quarter was in line with retail sales growth in our stores. As I mentioned in the overview, we launched our newly redesigned website in October. The new site is, without doubt, more engaging with greater storytelling and video content. It's easier to navigate. And for the first time, we are showcasing our Blue Book Collection of million-dollar jewelry.", "The new site also offers suggestions of related product ideas for customers and an interesting and fun Drop a Hint feature for the holidays. Early indications show that visitors are spending considerably more time on the new site and we encourage you to visit the site and take a look for yourself.", "And as a reflection of our effective use of digital media, we were pleased to see that Tiffany, for the third consecutive year, was recently ranked #1 by L2, a think tank for digital innovation, in their Digital IQ Index, assessing the digital competence of 80 global watch and jewelry brands.", "Now let's look at a few merchandising highlights for the third quarter. Overall, we continued to see the strongest sales growth in statement, fine and solitaire jewelry, meaning jewelry with gemstones at mid to higher price points. But we're also pleased to see some initial signs of improvement in the fashion jewelry category.", "Strong statement jewelry sales in the quarter reflected the success of an exclusive event in New York that we held in October for some of our Tiffany registered customers as well as statement sales in some other markets.", "Notable highlights in fine jewelry in the third quarter were strong sales in the Enchant collection, with an expansion of the collection coming next year; our extraordinary Yellow Diamond collection; new jewelry designs with pink diamond accents and our Victoria collection. And we are pleased with sales of our Cobblestone and Select collections, which have been expanded with a focus on diamonds and colored gemstones.", "Straddling both the fine and fashion jewelry categories is our Keys collection, which is enjoying a strong sales resurgence. After being introduced 4 years ago, this popular collection is showing continued strength in gold and platinum styles accented with diamonds, and is now also benefiting from newer designs in platinum accented with colored diamonds.", "In fashion jewelry, the big story right now is the success of our reinterpreted and recently launched Atlas collection in various metals and styles but with noteworthy popularity in gold pieces.", "I should add that our marketing communications in support of the Atlas collection will be ongoing. The Ziegfeld collection in silver pearls and onyx continues to post strong results 5 months after the premiere of The Great Gatsby movie. And Tiffany's Metro collection continues to be a solid performer.", "Engagement jewelry sales in the quarter were higher in most regions. While that very meaningful category is certainly led by our 6-pronged Tiffany setting, we've also successfully expanded the range of designs over the years. The latest innovation is our Harmony engagement ring collection, which we launched exclusively in Japan last year and rolled it out globally earlier this year and just recently expanded the assortment with the addition of Harmony band rings.", "So we were pleased with either solid performance or initial signs of some improvement across most of our jewelry categories. There are a lot of new products in the development stages under the leadership of our new Design Director, Francesca Amfitheatrof, who we were delighted to welcome to Tiffany in September. She's already fully immersed in our design process with her team, especially focused on reinvigorating the fashion jewelry category.", "Regarding our watch business, we are proceeding with plans to design, produce, market and distribute our own Tiffany & Co. brand watches. However, the previously disclosed claims and counterclaims between Swatch and Tiffany are still pending in a confidential arbitration in the Netherlands, and the panel will issue its decision at an undetermined future date.", "I'm now very pleased to turn the call over to Jim.", "James N. Fernandez", "Okay, thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Tiffany's third quarter results continued the improvement we've seen in the past few quarters and we're very pleased with our progress. Earnings benefited from healthy sales growth, gross margin improvement and sales leverage on well-managed cost.", "Gross margin of 57% in the third quarter was 2.6 points above last year and above our expectation. This contrasted with a 3.5-point decline in last year's third quarter when we were experiencing significant pressure from higher product costs.", "As we have previously noted, we began to feel diminishing product cost pressures near the end of 2012, which turned into a tailwind in the second quarter of 2013. I'm sure you are all aware of the lag we experience in realizing changes in gross margins due to our long lead times and relatively modest inventory turnover. And we are now benefiting from those reduced product costs, which should continue at least through year-end.", "We are also benefiting from price increases we took earlier in the year to catch up with costs after avoiding any meaningful price increases in 2012.", "Partly offsetting the product cost benefit in the quarter was a continuing shift in sales mix toward higher price point, lower gross margin products, including strong statement jewelry sales. However, we are now seeing some improvement in fashion jewelry sales growth, although it is not growing as fast as the total company.", "Sales mix is an important component of gross margin and always more difficult to forecast, and we believe that it could have some mitigating effects on the extent of gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter as well.", "But all in all, we are now forecasting that gross margin for the full year will be higher than last year's 57%.", "Moving down the income statement, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5% in the third quarter, largely due to higher labor and store-related costs. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation, primarily from the weaker yen, SG&A expense rose 8%. So measuring it either on a GAAP or a constant-exchange-rate basis, we improved the ratio of SG&A expenses to sales by leveraging fixed costs and we continue to forecast an improved SG&A expense ratio for the full year.", "As a result of the increase in gross margin and the improved SG&A expense ratio, earnings from operations rose 31% in the quarter on a 7% sales increase. And we are expecting operating margin improvement for the full year.", "Interest and other expenses, net, were $14 million in the third quarter versus $15 million last year and we continue to forecast it at about $58 million for the full year.", "Our effective tax rate of 32.3% in the third quarter was down from 38.4% in last year's third quarter. This year's rate benefited from the onetime favorable impact of tax regulations related to the tax basis of fixed assets as well as differences in the geographical mix of earnings. Last year's higher rate resulted from our truing-up of the prior year's tax position upon filing our tax returns. We estimate a full year effective tax rate in the range of 34% to 35%.", "So with virtually everything moving in a favorable direction, we were able to generate a 31% increase in operating earnings and a 50% increase in net earnings in the third quarter, and diluted EPS rose 49%. This was better than the expectation included in our last published guidance, which leads us to increase our full year forecast.", "Our guidance for the full year now calls for earnings per diluted share of $3.65 to $3.75, which does not include a $0.05 charge we recorded earlier in the year, and which compares with last year's $3.25 per share. We are basing that on full year assumptions, calling for mid-single-digit worldwide sales growth in dollars or high single-digit growth in local currency, with comp store sales growth in local currencies ranging from low-double digits in Asia-Pacific in Japan to mid-single digits in Europe and low-single digits in the Americas.", "Backing into a fourth quarter sales forecast, this implies mid-single digit sales growth in dollars or high-single-digit sales growth in local currency with single-digit comp increases in all regions.", "And our assumption of a full year improvement in the operating margin coming from a favorable gross margin and expense ratio implies a modest improvement in the operating margin in the fourth quarter.", "We continue to pursue an active pace of organic expansion and we have a healthy balance sheet to support it. Our return on average assets was 10% on a trailing basis and return on average stockholders' equity was 18%. Our long-term financial objectives continue to call for achieving at least 10% ROA and 15% ROE.", "I'm pleased to report that inventories are at very appropriate levels. Net inventories of $2.4 billion at October 31 was 6% higher than a year ago comprised of a 5% increase in finished goods and a 7% increase in combined raw material and work-in-process inventories. Excluding the effect of currency translation, primarily the stronger dollar versus the weaker yen, net inventories would've increased 9%.", "For the full year, we are forecasting a 5% inventory increase in dollars. Whether it's measured in dollars or local currency, inventory growth this year has been slightly less than sales growth, which is consistent with our long-term objective.", "Accounts receivable on October 31 were 3% above last year, reflecting worldwide sales growth and would've increased 10% when excluding the effect of foreign currency translation. Receivables are turning at more than 20x per year.", "Capital expenditures were $149 million year-to-date versus $157 million in last year's year-to-date. And we are projecting about $225 million of CapEx for the year versus $220 million last year.", "In terms of liquidity, we had $521 million of cash and cash equivalents at October 31 versus $345 million a year ago. Total short-term and long-term debt increased $30 million from a year ago, but as a percentage of stockholders' equity, declined to 36% from 40% a year ago.", "So we have a solid balance sheet and continue to forecast achieving positive free cash flow of around $300 million in 2013 versus the $109 million in 2012.", "Behind the scenes, our manufacturing facilities, diamond sourcing organization and distribution centers are functioning effectively to maintain high in-store product availability and to efficiently ship products to customers.", "In summary, the third quarter was another good one for Tiffany and we believe we are well positioned for the holiday season. We have pursued an active pace of store expansion this year, which includes adding a net of 14 stores in 2013. We've introduced several exciting and well-received new jewelry collections and we've enhanced our marketing communications.", "Despite the obvious economic and consumer uncertainties in some regions, our management team sees great opportunities ahead of us, and we're enthusiastic about our ability to fully realize Tiffany's longer-term growth potential.", "That wraps up my comments. I'll now turn the call back to Mark.", "Mark L. Aaron", "Thanks, Jim. We hope all of you found today's conference call to be informative. You may also listen to a replay on our website, or by dialing (888) 203-1112 in the U.S., or (719) 457-0820 outside the U.S. and entering passcode 3631782.

(NYSE:TIF) Q4 2013 Earnings Conference Call March 21, 2014  8:30 PM ET", "Executives", "Mark Aaron - Investor Relations", "Jim Fernandez - Chief Operating Officer, Executive Vice President", "Analysts", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Tiffany & Company Fourth Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today's call is Jim Fernandez, Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark Aaron", "Thank you. Good day, everyone. Jim and I welcome you to our conference call to review highlights of Tiffany's performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2013, as well as to provide key financial expectations for 2014.", "Please first note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.", "Now, let's proceed. As an overview, worldwide net sales rose 5% in the fourth quarter or 9% on a constant exchange rate basis, which was a bit better than the respective 4% and 8% increases we had reported for the holiday period. Gross margin rose 1.4 points in the quarter. As previously disclosed, net earnings were impacted by the adverse arbitration rule that you are all familiar with resulting in a net loss of $104 million in the quarter. However, excluding net charge, net earnings rose 6% in the quarter.", "Finally, we are pleased that the 6% increase in full year net sales met the expectations that we set a year ago, while net earnings growth excluding charges of 15% in the year surpassed our initial expectation. Let's now look at sales performance, where we posted growth in all regions on a constant exchange rate basis.", "First, in terms of geographical mix by region, the Americans represented 48% of worldwide net sales in 2013, which was unchanged from 2012. Asia-Pacific was 23% of sales, up from 21% in 2012. Japan was 14% of sales versus 17% in 2012, but the decline was currency-related and Europe was 12% of sales, up from 11% in 2012.", "Starting with the Americans, the 6% sales increase in the fourth quarter was consistent with holiday results and was driven by an increase in the average price per jewelry units sold. A decline in jewelry unit volume was limited to the fashion jewelry category, which occurred mostly at price points under $500.", "For the full-year, our sales in the Americas rose 5% due to price and volume dynamics that were similar to the quarter. We concluded the year on a stronger than expected note in the Americans. We attribute the improvement to at least some extent to selling initiatives taken by our regional management that focused first on our 25 largest stores to better engage the customers to our sales professionals and through enhanced visual merchandising. That focus will eventually be extended to all stores.", "On a constant exchange rate basis, comparable-store sales rose 7% in the fourth quarter due to geographically broad based sales growth across most markets, and comps were up 3% for the year with sales growth in the New York flagship store outpacing modest growth in branch stores.", "We are not ready to call the 7% comp increase in the quarter the beginning of a trend, but are encouraged nonetheless. You may be interested to know that our three largest branch stores by sales volume in the region in 2013, were in South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, California, followed by our Union Square store in San Francisco and our store on Michigan Avenue in Chicago.", "To reiterate what we have said previously, we can no longer quantify total foreign tourists sales in the Americas region, because of legal restrictions on data collection in some U.S. states. However in the New York flagship store, which in 2013 represented 8% of worldwide sales, were 16% of the Americas region, sales to foreign tourists increased and accounted for approximately 45% of that store's sales in 2013.", "The increased spending came from Chinese visitors as well as higher spending by European visitors while a decline in Japanese tourist spending in New York and other markets too very likely reflected the yen's weakness. We believe that foreign tourist spending will continue to be a meaningful portion of sales in the Americans, as we generate greater brand awareness in Asia, Europe and elsewhere that also fosters greater spending when customers travel.", "Elsewhere in the Americans, we achieved modest comparable store sales growth in constant currencies in Canada, Mexico and Brazil, in both, the fourth quarter and year.", "We opened six stores in the Americas in 2013, in the Garden State Plaza Mall, New Jersey, in Cleveland, Ohio, Eton Center, in New Orleans, in the West Edmonton Mall in Alberta Canada, in Curitiba, Brazil and in Villahermosa, Mexico. Store relocations, renovations and enhanced visual merchandising complement our worldwide expansion strategy and is one example in 2013 we relocated on Bloor Street store in Toronto to offer the utmost shopping environment to our customers. We finished the year with 121 company-operated stores in the Americas, including 94 the U.S. 12 in Canada, 10 in Mexico and 5 in Brazil.", "Turning to the Asia-Pacific region, sales increased 8% in the fourth quarter due to increased jewelry unit volume and rose 17% for the full-year due to increases in jewelry unit volume and price per jewelry unit sold. While the 8% sales increase in the quarter was lower than we had initially expected, it was nonetheless better than the 5% increase we had reported for the holiday period, indicating substantial improvements in January that reflected strong growth throughout the region and perhaps reflecting the celebration of the earlier Chinese New Year.", "Total Asia-Pacific sales on a constant exchange rate basis increased 11% in the quarter and 18% in the year, reflecting comp store sales growth of 4% in the quarter, with growth in most countries and 11% in the year with growth in all countries, and of course the opening of a number of new stores. In fact, we opened seven stores in the region in 2013, including four stores in China, one in Hong Kong and two in Taiwan, while closing one older store in Taiwan. We finished the year with 72 stores in the Asia-Pacific region. 45 of those stores are located in Greater China and represented more than half of the region sales in 2013. Our highest volume store in the region is on Canton Road in Hong Kong.", "Continuing to expand brand awareness of Tiffany in China through our store base and marketing activities is critical to generating local sales growth, but also to influencing Chinese tourists when they travel to our other markets. When sales are measured in yen, our business in Japan performed well throughout the fourth quarter and year. In local currency, total sales increased 8% in the fourth quarter and 11% in the full year due to a higher average price per jewelry units sold in both periods with some declines jewelry units sold.", "Comp store sales in yen rose 8% and 10% in those periods. This was better than we had expected at the start of 2013, however the yen weekend about 20% against the U.S. dollar in 2013, which had a significant negative translation effect on our sales, resulting in reported total sales declining 12% in the fourth quarter and 9% in the full-year with roughly similar comp store sales declines.", "While the weaker yen likely had a negative effect on our sales in New York, Hawaii and Guam and some other U.S. markets, it's very possible some of that demand shifted toward local consumption in Japan. For translation purposes, we are planning the yen at \u20ac105 to the $1 for 2014.", "During 2013, the closing of the Matsuzakaya department store in Tokyo for multi-year renovation required the closing of the Tiffany store that they posted there, but we are guessing that much of that business probably shifted to our nearby Ginza store. We finished the year with 54 locations in Japan and our Ginza store produces the highest volume in Japan and accounts for more than 10% of total sales in Japan.", "Tiffany stores in Europe faced some obvious macroeconomic challenges in 2013, but our expanded brand awareness and the opportunities provided by our under penetration in that region helped us to achieve generally healthy performance. Total sales increased 10% in the fourth quarter consistent with the holiday period and rose 9% in the year. The sales growth in both periods was fueled by increases in jewelry unit volume and in the average price per jewelry units sold.", "On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales rose 7% in both the quarter and year, while comp store sales increased 2% in the fourth quarter and 4% in the year. Geographical trends in Europe were mixed over the course of the year. Sales in the U.K. represented a little more than 40% of European sales in 2013, and our highest volume store in Europe is on Old Bond Street.", "Over the course of the year, relative sales performance between the U.K. and continental Europe fluctuated, but there was no meaningful difference in performance for the full year. Foreign tourist spending has become a meaningful part of our business in Europe, which we estimate represented more than a quarter of total sales. Our stores in France had the highest percentage of those sales to foreign tourists with Chinese shoppers accounting for significant part of it.", "We opened three stores in Europe in 2013, one in Stuttgart, Germany and two in Italy, in Rome and Verona, and finished the year with 37 locations in Europe. We also renovated our Frankfurt store and relocated our Florence store. Lastly, Tiffany's other sales rose 47% in the fourth quarter and 53% in the year. We are very pleased with comparable store sales growth of 23% in the quarter and 14% in the year, representing the five stores in the United Arab Emirates, three in Dubai and two in Abu Dhabi, that were converted from wholesale distribution to company-operated locations in July 2012.", "The remainder of the increase in other sales in both periods was primarily due to wholesale sales of diamond that we acquired through our rough sourcing program and subsequently sell, because they don't meet our requirements. For the full-year across all regions, we opened 16 company-operated stores and closed two existing ones, representing a 5% increase in the number of locations and a 3% increase in gross square footage.", "In terms of sales productivity, Tiffany's company-operated stores generated $3,100 sales per gross square foot in 2013, versus $3,000 in 2012. Productivity range from Asia-Pacific at $4,800 per foot up from $4,500 in 2012 to $3,800 per foot in Japan versus $4,200 in 2012, to Europe with $3,300 a foot consistent with 2012 and the Americas at $2,400 versus $2,300 a foot in 2012.", "It's worth noting that the decline in Japan's productivity in dollars was entirely due to the negative translation effect from the weaker yen, while retail store productivity in Japan measured in yen rose 12%. Our store base is complemented by our multilingual web presence that spans across 13 countries with e-commerce site, as well as informational sites in six additional countries. Worldwide e-commerce sales which are included in each region represented 6% of worldwide sales in 2013 or 8% of the total sales in the countries in which we operate e-commerce sites. Those percentages were unchanged from the prior year.", "We launched our redesigned site last October and visitors appear to be more engaged with its enhanced content as they are spending more time on the new site. Now, looking at some merchandising highlights, sales growth in the fourth quarter occurred across most product categories. The strongest sales growth continued to be in the statement fine and solitaire jewelry category, which incorporates jewelry with gemstones at the mid-to-higher price points and we were encouraged with improvement in the fashion jewelry category with the sales strength coming from gold jewelry, implying continued softness in silver especially at price points under $500.", "Statement jewelry continued to post strong growth in 2013 as more customers, especially in Asia-Pacific and the Americans discovered Tiffany's extraordinary offerings. As we mentioned previously, we invested considerably in recent years to expand our statement jewelry assortment and we are delighted with the performance of this ultra high-end category.", "Our success in fine jewelry reflects an extraordinary assortment of diamond jewelry, with increasing demand for colored diamonds and other gemstone. In particular, Tiffany's yellow diamond collection continued to sparkle with great success in 2013. Additional popular collections worth noting, included the Enchant collection, new jewelry designs with pink diamond accents introduced in 2013 and our beautiful Victoria Collection. Also, our Cobblestone and Soleste collections were well received with their expanded designs focused on diamonds and colored gemstones.", "Engagement jewelry category performed well in most regions in 2013. While that category is anchored by our six-pronged Tiffany setting and complemented by additional settings we have introduced over the years. The latest innovation has been the successful Harmony engagement ring collection. We launched Harmony in Japan in 2012, expanded distribution globally in 2013 and then most recently broadened this assortment with Harmony band rings.", "I said the word encouraged with improvement in the fashion jewelry category, the best example is ATLAS. We could not be more pleased with the success of that newly reinterpreted collection in various metals and styles which debuted last fall and will be expanded this spring. We targeted much of our advertising on ATLAS during the holiday season and that focused approach and powerful message drove strong results. It's also worth mentioning Tiffany's stepping back into the Jazz age earlier in the year with the launch of our Ziegfeld and Gatsby collections tied to the premier of The Great Gatsby movie.", "Paloma Picasso's new Olive Leaf collection enjoyed a very successful first year and let's not forget the importance of some our Tiffany's iconic collection such as Metro, which continues to be a solid performer.", "Our Keys collection introduced five years ago, enjoyed a strong sales resurgence in 2013. This popular collection in gold and platinum, which straddles fine and fashion jewelry benefited from newer designs in platinum, accented with colored diamonds. We finish the year feeling quite good about trends in most jewelry categories and are equally excited about new designs that will debut in 2014.", "Our design team is focused on an array of new designs, including the expanded ATLAS collection this spring and with a special focus on invigorating fashion jewelry. Please stay tuned for an exciting new collection that will debut this fall as well as of course other design introductions across all categories.", "I will now turn the call over to Jim to review the rest of the earnings statement, the balance sheet and our expectations for 2014.", "Jim Fernandez", "Thanks, Mark. Notwithstanding some obvious economic and consumer uncertainties as well as an unfavorable arbitration ruling, 2013 was indeed an excellent year for Tiffany's sales and earnings, excluding the arbitration related charge reaching record levels. Tiffany's achievements span the areas of product development, store expansion, marketing, the supply chain and strengthening the management team with new regional heads of Northern America and Europe, and bringing in a new design director.", "Looking at the rest of the earning statement, gross margin increased 1.4 points to 60.5% in the fourth quarter and rose 1.1 points to 58.1% in the year. In both periods, we benefited from price increases we took earlier in the year to catch up with costs after avoiding any meaningful price increases in 2012. In addition, we benefited from diminishing pressure and our actual reductions in product costs.", "Partly offsetting those benefits in the full year was a shift in sales mix toward higher-priced, lower gross margin in fine and statement jewelry, however I will add that those higher price points sales provide substantial incremental gross profit that can be leveraged against fixed costs and ultimately improve our operating margin. In addition, recent improvement in fashion jewelry sales helped in the fourth quarter and should eventually provide some further upside to gross margin.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 7% in the fourth quarter reflecting higher fixed and variable labor costs such as sales commission, and incentive compensation and higher store-related costs. SG&A expenses rose 6% in the year for similar reason.", "Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation, primarily from the weaker yen, SG&A expense growth would have been 3% greater in both, the quarter and the year. Please also note that full year SG&A expense includes $9.4 million pre-tax charge or $0.04 per diluted share recorded in first quarter related to staffing reduction and sub-leasing of certain office space.", "As previously disclosed, we recorded the charge in the fourth quarter related to the adverse ruling in The Swatch arbitration. The total pre-tax charge was $473 million and the after-tax amount was $293 million or $2.27 per diluted share. We should note that $488 million of the pre-tax charge was recorded in earnings from operations while a $7 million foreign currency translation gain was recorded in interest and other expenses net.", "In terms of earnings from operations, we think it is more relevant to look at the numbers on a non-GAAP basis that exclude the arbitration and other specific charges. Doing so, operating earnings increased 8% in the fourth quarter on the 5% sales growth and rose 14% in the year on the 6% sales growth giving us an adjusted operating margin of 19.7% for the year versus 18.4% last year.", "Interest and other expenses net were $8 million and $49 million in the respective fourth quarter and year, excluding the $7 million transaction gain I just mentioned, interest and other expenses net would have been $16 million in the quarter and $57 million in the year, roughly in line with what we had previously projected.", "Tiffany had an income tax benefit in the fourth quarter, due to arbitration award charge, while the full year effective income tax rate was 28.8%. Excluding the impact of the arbitration award and other specific charges, the effective tax rate was 36.1% in the fourth quarter versus 35% last year. The full year rate was 34.8% versus 35.3% in 2012.", "The net $473 million pre-tax arbitration award charge led to a net loss of $104 million in the fourth quarter. Full year net earnings also included some specific charges that have been recorded in the first quarter, however excluding those charges Tiffany earned $190 million in the quarter and $481 million in the year representing EPS growth of 5% and 15%, respectively and putting us near the high end of our most recently disclosed expectations.", "Our technically subpar 4% return on average assets and 7% return on average stockholders' equity in 2013 were due to the changes we recorded, and under more normal circumstances, would have been more in line with recent years and with our financial objectives.", "I'm pleased to state that even after the payment of the arbitration award we finished the year with a balance sheet that provides with solid base to pursue our ongoing business plans and future expansions.", "Inventories of $2.3 billion at year end were up 4% from the year ago. In comparison, net inventories had increased 8% in 2012, so we met our objective for a deceleration in the rate of inventory growth. The 4% increase in 2013, included a 3% increase in finished goods that support new stores and expanded offerings and a 5% increase in combined raw material and work in process inventories. Excluding foreign currency translation, net inventories would have increased 6% in the year.", "We are pleased that, whether in dollars or local currency, inventory growth was less than sales growth in 2013, which is consistent with our long-term objectives. We are well positioned with high levels of inventory availability in our stores and our supply chain in diamond sourcing and internal manufacturing is operating efficiently to meet our growing product needs. Accounts receivables of $189 million at year end were up 9% in the year, reflecting worldwide sales growth. The increase would have been 14%, excluding foreign currency translation. Receivables turned at a rate of 22 times a year.", "Capital expenditures came in at $221 million for the year versus $220 million last year and a bit less than our forecast due to timing differences and they represented 5% of sales. More than half of the spending went towards store openings, renovations and relocations. Investments in information technology is another major area and spending will increase this year and next as we upgrade and introduce new systems for global customer relationship management and for more advanced order and inventory management, all of which should yield longer-term sales and working capital benefits.", "Adding it all up, Tiffany had free cash flow which we define as cash flow from operating activities, less capital expenditures, compared with last year's $109 million in ['12]. However in the fourth quarter, we made a payment to Swatch of $473 million for the adverse arbitration ruling. We expect to generate at least $400 million of free cash flow in 2014.", "As a result of strong earnings growth and favorable working capital management, offset by the one-time arbitration payment, we finished the year with $367 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments versus $506 million a year ago.", "Total short-term and long-term debt of $1 billion at year end was about $40 million above the $959 million a year ago. Total debt as a percentage of stockholders' equity was 37% at year end, unchanged from the year ago. In addition, we announced in a separate news release this morning that we have been authorized to resume share repurchases in 2014.", "Tiffany's board approved a new program and authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of stock over the next three years. Based on our long-term outlook for earnings and cash flow, we think that this is an appropriate way to return a portion of the excess capital to stockholders while also mitigating dilution on earnings per share in stock based compensation.", "Let's now turn to our outlook for 2014, which will be a year of exciting expansion and investing. My references to comparisons to 2013 will exclude the effect of the arbitration award in 2013's fourth quarter, as well as other specific charges recorded in 2013's first quarter.", "We have a lot going on with the addition of new jewelry collections, the opening of some major new stores, incremental spending on IT systems and compelling marketing. In total, we are projecting net earnings to increase 9% to 11% to a range of $4.05 to $4.15 per diluted share. This compares with non-GAAP $3.73 per diluted share that Tiffany earned in 2013.", "Looking at the components of the earnings guidance, we are projecting net sales to increase by a high single-digit percentage in both, dollars and on a constant exchange rate basis, with total sales and comparable store sales growth in all regions. We finished last year with 289 company-operated stores in 24 countries and reflecting our ongoing strategy of opportunistic store expansion, we expect to open 13 new stores in 2014 and close four.", "New store plans include opening four stores in the Americas, including three new stores in the U.S, in Aventura, Florida, in Miami Design District and on Boston's Newbury Street, closing our store in East Hampton and opening our 11th store in Mexico in Cancun, opening five stores in Asia Pacific, including three in China, one in Australia, in Adelaide and our first in Thailand and closing one store in Taiwan. Opening two stores in Japan and closing one existing store, opening a major store in Europe on the famous Champs-Elysee in Paris and in the emerging markets opening Tiffany's first company-operated store in Russia in Moscow and closing a small store in Dubai.", "We will, of course, also be renovating a number of older stores to enhanced visual merchandising and the in-store customer experience. We are projecting an increase in our operating margin tied to a higher gross margin and SG&A expense leverage. The forecasted gross margin improvement is based on sales leverage on fixed costs as well as taking on average a single-digit percentage price increase in this first quarter and some residual benefit from lower input costs.", "We are also expecting some improvement in the SG&A expense ratio this year coming from sales leverage on fixed cost. We are projecting interest and other expenses net at $65 million to $70 million in 2014, with the increase over 2013, essentially reflected in the interest cost on higher average debt levels. We are estimating an effective income tax rate of approximately 35% in 2014, which is virtually unchanged from the adjusted 34.8% rate in 2013.", "In summary, Tiffany enjoyed a solid year of sales and earnings growth and we believe company is well positioned for continued success throughout 2014. We hope that you share our excitement about Tiffany's many growth opportunities.", "On a final note, I presume you saw the announcement two days ago that Tiffany has hired Mr. Ralph Nicoletti as an Executive Vice President and to serve as the company's next Chief Financial Officer. Ralph brings solid experience to Tiffany and a valuable global perspective and I'm sure that Mark will be introducing Ralph to many of you.", "I believe we put together a strong global management team to lead the company to even greater success in the future. I'm especially proud of the world-class finance, IT, operations and supply chain organization that we built, and has decided that after an exciting 30-year career at Tiffany, this is a good time for me to retire at the end of July.", "I truly enjoyed my relationships with many of you on Wall Street and have appreciated your interest in Tiffany. You can be sure that I will be following Tiffany's progress and its stock price and I wish all of you the best.", "Now, I will turn the call back to Mark.", "Mark Aaron", "Thank, Jim. We hope all of you on today's call found our comments to be informative. A replay is available on our website or by dialing 888-203-1112 in the U.S. or 719-457-0820 outside the U.S., and entering pass code 5105327.", "As always, please feel free to call me with any questions and please note on your calendar that we plan to report first quarter financial results on Wednesday, May 21st, before the market opens. Thanks for listening.", "Operator", "That does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your line at this time.

(NYSE:TIF) Q1 2014 Earnings Conference Call May 21, 2014  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Ralph Nicoletti - EVP and CFO", "Mark Aaron - Investor Relations", "Analysts", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Tiffany & Company First Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today\u2019s call is Mr. Ralph Nicoletti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "And at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark Aaron", "Thank you and hello everyone. Earlier today we issued Tiffany\u2019s first quarter financial results and I hope I know you\u2019ve had a chance to read the news release. I\u2019m pleased to have Tiffany's new Chief Financial Officer, Ralph Nicoletti here with me to review highlights of those results and to comment on the outlook for the rest of the year.", "As always we first ask you to note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany\u2019s Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.", "Now we can proceed. We think you will agree that Tiffany has enjoyed a strong start to 2014 with solid sales and earnings growth in the first quarter. Worldwide net sales increased by 13% or 15% on a constant-exchange-rate basis, with strong growth in most regions, including unusually strong growth in Japan which I will address shortly.", "We had a net of three stores, sales growth occurred across all of jewelry categories, which we are pleased to say included a healthy increase in the fashion jewelry category. Operating margin rose due to a higher gross margin and an improved expense ratio and net earnings rose 50% on a GAAP basis and 41% when excluding one-time charges in last year\u2019s first quarter.", "Looking first at sales performance in the quarter, all regions achieved total sales growth in dollars and on a constant-exchange-rate basis. ", "In the Americas region, total sales rose 8% due to an increase in the average price per jewelry unit sold. However, while overall jewelry unit volume was almost equal to last year, we were pleased with healthy unit growth in the fine solitaire and statement jewelry and engagement jewelry categories as well as with an improving trend in fashion jewelry.", "We believe these improved results in the Americas reflect to some degree enhance selling initiatives being taken by regional management that are focused on better engaging customers through our sales professional and enhanced visual merchandising in our stores. Another factor contributing to the growth were sales from our successful annual Blue Book event in April, in New York.", "On a constant-exchange-rate basis, comparable store sales increased 8%, which is on top of a 3% comp increase from last year\u2019s first quarter. Geographically we saw solid comp growth in many of our markets and in our New York flagship store. In addition, net sales growth in both the New York flagship store and the overall region was driven by a combination of domestic customer demand and sales to foreign tourists.", "In fact, we even saw slight sales increase in the tourist markets of Hawaii and Guam, which had been challenging for a while. Lastly, I\u2019m sure some of you\u2019re wondering about our Valentine\u2019s Day, so I\u2019m pleased to report that despite snowstorms that affected a number of our stores in the eastern U.S., we enjoyed very good Valentine\u2019s Day results.", "In other parts of the Americas region, a lack of sales growth in Canada surely reflected a difficult comparison to several large statement jewelry transactions last year. On the other hand, our stores in Latin America posted solid constant currency sales growth.", "During the first quarter we opened a store in Cancun, marking our 11th store in Mexico. We also saw solid growth in the Asia Pacific region with total sales of 17% in the quarter, primarily due to strong unit volume growth across all jewelry categories. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales rose 19% in the quarter with comp store sales growth of 10% that was generated by strong sales growth across Greater China as well as in Australia.", "This was on top of a 9% comp increase in last year\u2019s first quarter. We didn\u2019t open any stores in Asia Pacific in the quarter, however, to reiterate what\u2019s been said in the past, expanding brand awareness of Tiffany & Co. in China through our store base and marketing activities is important to generate local sales growth, but also the influence Chinese tourists when they travel to our other markets.", "As you saw in our news release, Tiffany had a very strong quarter in Japan however you measure it. In dollars, total sales rose 20% due to growth both in the average price per jewelry unit sold and in jewelry unit volume. But the yen was on average about 9% weaker than the U.S. dollar year-over-year. So when excluding that negative translation effect, total sales in the yen increased 29% in the first quarter and comp store sales rose 30%.", "We think you will agree that this substantial increase was even more impressive when we consider that comps in last year\u2019s first quarter had increased 21%. Of course it was widely reported in the media that overall consumer spending in Japan surged in March prior to an April 1st increase in their consumption tax. And Tiffany sales surged to due to the pull forward of buying.", "As expected, since then, we\u2019ve been experiencing sales declines which have been recently moderating. As a result, we\u2019re not changing our previous expectation for healthy sales growth in the full-year. During the quarter, we opened the store in the Sogo department store, in Kobe.", "Looking at Europe, total sales rose 9% in the first quarter. However, a large portion of that sales increase reflected translation benefits from the strengthening of both the pound and euro versus the dollar. Therefore on a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 2% on higher jewelry unit volume, while comp store sales declined 3% as compared to a 6% comp increase in the first quarter of 2013.", "Geographically constant currency comps in the U.K. and overall Continental Europe were similarly soft, although individual performances by country within Continental Europe were mixed. We believe Tiffany is being affected by economic challenges in some European countries, but another factor to consider is tourism.", "We have estimated that foreign tourist spending represents more than a quarter of our sales in Europe and those sales in the first quarter were flat with last year, which might reflect the impact from strengthening European currencies.", "But looking at the bigger picture, Tiffany continues to expand its brand awareness in Europe and beyond and we\u2019re confident that there are significant long-term store and market share growth opportunities.", "We also expanded Tiffany\u2019s presence in Paris last month when we opened a major store on the magnificent Champs Elysees; although the store\u2019s grand opening celebration will be in a few weeks. Not surprisingly the store is already serving many foreign visitors; in fact you might be interested to know that 15 languages are spoken by our staff in the Champs Elysees stores.", "Rounding out the regional sales review, Tiffany\u2019s other sales increased 39% in the first quarter. A portion of that increase was due to 18% comparable store sales growth in the five stores we operate in the United Arab Emirates. In addition, we were delighted to open our first company operated Tiffany & Co. store in Moscow in the famous GUM department store during the quarter and initial results were encouraging. The balance of the increase in other sales was due to wholesale sales of diamonds that we acquired through our rough sourcing program and subsequently sell because they don\u2019t need our requirements.", "Our worldwide expansion plans continue to call for opening 13 stores in 2014, a few of which have a more noteworthy market presence and closing four smaller ones, which in total represents a net 3% increase in company operated locations and a net 4% increase in gross square footage.", "We will also be renovating a number of older stores to enhance their market presence, visual merchandising and the in-store customer experience. Beyond our store base worldwide e-commerce sales increased 6% in the first quarter. In addition to contributing to overall sales growth, our Web site served as an important marketing communications vehicle that helped to drive store traffic.", "So that covers the regional sales review. In terms of merchandising highlights for the quarter, as I mentioned earlier, we were pleased with varying degrees of sales growth in all product categories. We continue to see healthy growth in statement, fine, and solitaire jewelry, meaning pieces with diamonds and other gemstones at mid to higher price points.", "As we\u2019ve noted on previous calls, we\u2019ve been seeing increasing interest in colored diamonds and other gemstones and some examples would include the Yellow Diamond, Enchant, and Victoria collections among many others. And in statement jewelry, I already alluded to the success of our Blue Book event in April, in New York. That event showcase truly extraordinary and one of a kind pieces for select customers who visited us from around the world. The response was excellent and sales far surpassed the successful Blue Book event we held last year.", "The engagement jewelry category was another strong performer in the quarter, reflecting substantial demand for diamond solitaire rings and wedding bands as well. The relatively new Harmony collection continued to perform very well, complimenting of course our iconic six-prong Tiffany setting and other settings too.", "And we\u2019re definitely encouraged with solid improvement in our fashion jewelry category in silver, but even more so in gold pieces, probably the biggest story in that category is the success of our distinctive Atlas collection introduced last fall and being expanded now with additional designs.", "A few other product highlights worth mentioning in the fine and fashion categories in the first quarter, included strong growth in Elsa Peretti Diamonds by the Yard, a truly timeless collection originally introduced 40 years ago. The continued resurgence of the Keys collection, especially in styles with diamonds, and Paloma Picasso\u2019s Olive Leaf collection that debuted last year.", "For later in the year, we\u2019re looking forward to the global introduction in September of a major new fashion jewelry collection with some pieces extending into fine jewelry in a range of precious metals both with and without diamonds. Please stay tuned for that exciting launch. So you can see that this strong sales growth in the first quarter clearly reflected solid results across most regions and product categories.", "I\u2019m now pleased to turn the call over to Ralph to review the rest of the earnings statement and the balance sheet, and to update you on our full-year expectations. Ralph?", "Ralph Nicoletti", "Thank you, Mark. I\u2019m delighted to be at Tiffany. Already in my brief time here, I can clearly see the strength, expansion potential, and earnings power of this great brand. Before going into the specifics, the key points to take away which drove our first quarter results are solid broad based sales growth across product categories and most geographies, accelerated purchasing patterns in Japan prior to the April 1st consumption tax increase, margin improvement on both gross and operating level, primarily driven by product cost, pricing and leveraging fixed cost, all of which leads to raising our full-year outlook to $4.15 to $4.25 per share.", "As Mark provided the sales review, I\u2019ll now comment on the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin of 58.2% was 2 full points higher than last year with the improvement resulting from favorable product costs, price increases taken across all product categories and regions, and meaningful sales leverage on fixed cost, and of course, the strong sales increase in Japan had some positive effect on overall gross margin.", "In addition, because of the improvement in fashion jewelry sales, we\u2019re pleased to be seeing a narrowing gap in the rate of sales growth for this category relative to other jewelry categories, which in the first quarter led to a minimal negative effect from sales mix on the gross margin. Overall, we continue to expect an increase in gross margin for the full-year, but not at the first quarter\u2019s magnitude.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5% in the first quarter, largely reflecting higher store related expenses and labor costs, of which a portion is variable. I should add that marketing expenses in the first quarter were lower than last year, but we expect those expenses as initially planned to be considerably higher year-over-year for the remaining quarters of 2014.", "As we noted in our release, last year\u2019s first quarter included $9 million of cost for staff and occupancy reductions. Excluding those expenses SG&A would have increased 8% in the quarter. Our outlook for the full-year continues to call for SG&A expense growth below the rate of sales growth.", "Operating earnings grew 49%, but 39% when excluding last year\u2019s charges, driven by sizable increases in sales and gross profits and leveraging SG&A expenses which was partly driven by the timing of marketing spending. Therefore the operating margin of 21% in the first quarter represented a solid increase over last year.", "Interest and other expenses net were $16 million in the quarter. And Tiffany\u2019s effective income tax rate of 35.1% in the quarter was virtually in line with last year. Putting it all together, net earnings in the quarter rose 50% to $126 million or $0.97 per diluted share. The increase was 41% when excluding the cost for staff and occupancy reductions in last year\u2019s first quarter.", "These operating results and efficient balance sheet are contributing to improvements in our returns on asset and equity. As most of you know, our long-term objectives continue to call for achieving at least a 10% ROA and at least a 15% ROE.", "Regarding the balance sheet, I believe we\u2019ve a solid financial base to support the growth of our business. Total debt as a percent of stockholders equity declined to 35% at April 30th from 37% a year-ago. Our single largest asset on the balance sheet was inventories, which totaled $2.4 billion at April 30th. That represented a 6% increase over April of 2013 to support anticipated sales growth, but also is indicative of our objective to keep inventory growth less than the rate of sales growth. Of course that objective includes maintaining high levels of inventory availability for our stores while managing them as productively as possible.", "Our accounts receivable was 7% above last year due to worldwide sales growth and receivable turnover is a healthy 21 times per year. Capital expenditures were $35 million in the first quarter unchanged from last year\u2019s first quarter.", "As we previously disclosed, we\u2019re increasing full-year capital expenditures as a result of making greater information technology investments this year and next as we upgrade and introduce new systems for global customer relationship management and for more advanced order and inventory management capabilities.", "As announced in March, Tiffany Board of Directors authorized a repurchase of up to $300 million of our common stock over a three-year period. We resumed repurchases in April and spent approximately $7 million to repurchase 82,000 shares at an average cost of approximately $87 per share. We believe this is a good way to return some excess capital to stockholders and mitigate dilution on earnings per share from stock-based compensation.", "Now I want to take a moment to comment on our full-year earnings outlook. We began the year projecting net earnings in the range of $4.05 to $4.15 per share or 9% to 11% higher than the $3.73 per share that was earned in 2013.", "Clearly we\u2019ve had a strong start to the year, but it\u2019s only challenging to determine how much of those gains can be extrapolated for the rest of the year, especially considering that the first quarter is historically the smallest one of the year. In terms of the components of our forecast, we\u2019re continuing to project high single-digit percentage sales increase with all regions expected to achieve total sales growth in U.S. dollars and varying degrees of comparable store sales growth on a constant-exchange-rate basis.", "And I already mentioned that we\u2019re expecting improvements in gross margin and the SG&A expense ratio for the year. As a result, we\u2019re increasing our full-year EPS forecast by $0.10 per share to $4.15 to $4.25 per share, representing 11% to 14% growth from last year\u2019s $3.73 per share. This reflects our strong start.", "However, it is early in the year; there is uncertainty about when sales growth will resume in Japan and/or economic headwinds in Europe. In fact, those two factors that especially in Japan as well as higher marketing spending as we mentioned will likely result in the second quarter\u2019s net earnings to be about equal to the prior-year.", "In summary, we hope you\u2019re all in agreement that these results in most respects were a very nice start to the year. We believe we\u2019re well positioned for the rest of 2014 and beyond. And beyond the key benefits derived from heritage and brand strength, Tiffany has an experienced management team a solid base of store distribution with growth potential and extraordinary product assortment and a highly developed infrastructure and product supply chain. I\u2019m delighted to be part of Tiffany\u2019s management team and I look forward to meeting many of you in the coming weeks and months.", "I'll now turn the call back to Mark.", "Mark Aaron", "Thanks, Ralph.

(NYSE:TIF) Q2 2014 Earnings Conference Call August 27, 2014  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Mark Aaron - VP of IR", "Ralph Nicoletti - EVP and CFO", "Analysts", "", "Operator", "Good day, everyone and welcome to the Tiffany & Company Second Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today\u2019s call is Ralph Nicoletti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "And at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead.", "Mark Aaron", "Thank you and hello everyone. We reported earlier today that Tiffany achieved better than expected financial results in the second quarter and I hope you\u2019ve had a chance to read the news release. On today\u2019s call, Ralph and I will review highlights of those results and comment on the full year outlook.", "As always, please first note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany\u2019s Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.", "Now let\u2019s look at results. As an overview, Tiffany performed well in the second quarter with sales in most regions generally either met or exceeded our expectations. Three months ago, we had forecasted second quarter net earnings could be approximately equal to the prior year, reflecting a substantial softening in demand in Japan sale which for the second quarter occurred as expected. As well as continued softness in Europe, which, in fact, softened more than we expected in the quarter.", "But as a result of solid growth in the America and Asia Pacific regions, worldwide net sales rose 7%. Embedded in the overall results was broad-based growth in most product categories and especially at mid-to-higher price points. Beyond the sales strength and important contributor to net earnings growth was an increase in gross margin which Ralph will address shortly.", "SG&A expenses paced a bit favorably to our expectation while interest and other expenses net and the effective tax rate were essentially on track. Adding it all up, Tiffany second quarter net earnings rose 16%. Tiffany\u2019s balance sheet remains strong and it made the Board of Directors increase the quarterly dividend rate by 12%.", "Let\u2019s now look at some details of regional sales performance in the quarter. In the Americas, total sales were up 9% primarily due to an overall increase in the average price per jewelry unit sold. We were pleased to experience healthy unit growth in the statement, fine and solitaire jewelry category as well as in our engagement jewelry and wedding band category. And we\u2019re pleased that fashion jewelry unit sales are benefiting from strength in gold jewelry.", "However, continued softness in silver jewelry unit sale in particular entry level sales under $500 was the reason why we had no growth in total jewelry units in the Americas. We\u2019ve now seen three consecutive quarters of sales improvement in the Americas which we believe reflect both internal and external factors. Here\u2019s the excitement of new products and compelling marketing, but we believe we are also benefiting in the Americas from new in-store selling initiatives focused on better engaging and consulting with our customers as well as enhancements in the visual merchandizing formats in our stores with those programs being extended throughout the store network.", "In addition, we benefited from foreign tourist spending that is likely tied to growing brand awareness globally and perhaps some currency fluctuation too. And of course, conditions in the U.S. are favorable for many of our customers. On a constant and exchange rate basis comparable store sales rose 8% in the quarter which followed an 8% comp increase in the first quarter and compared with the flat comp in last year\u2019s second quarter. Geographically, most markets in the U.S. posted healthy sales growth. A solid increase in New York flagship store sales was due to a combination of higher domestic customer demand as well as higher sales to foreign tourist especially from China and Europe. And sales have rebounded nicely in the tourist markets of Hawaii and Guam. ", "During the quarter we opened a 4800 square foot store in the Aventura Mall near Miami, marking our 94th store in the U.S. Our expansion plans for later in the year include opening stores in the Miami design district and on Boston\u2019s elegant Newbury Street. Outside the U.S., we experienced high single-digit to low double-digit local currency total sales growth with our growing presence in Canada, Mexico and Brazil. The Asia Pacific region achieved a 14% total sales increase in the quarter due to growth in the average price per jewelry unit sold and in jewelry unit volume.", "On a constant-exchange-rate basis increases of 13% in total sales and 7% in comp store sales reflected strength primarily in greater China and in Australia. You should note that the 7% comp increase followed a 10% increase in the first quarter and was on top of a 13% increase in last year\u2019s second quarter. We didn\u2019t open any stores in this region during the quarter but are on track to open two stores later in the year; one in Adelaide, Australia and one in China as well as relocating our store within the Hong Kong airport. Two additional stores in China and one in Thailand that were initially scheduled to open near the end of this year are now slated to open in the first half of 2015 due to timing delays.", "Now let\u2019s turn to Japan where sales have been volatile to say the least in the first half of this year. As I alluded to in the overview after experiencing a surge in spending in the first quarter as Japanese consumers purchased in advance of a consumption tax increase on April 1. We anticipated a significant demand to offset in the second quarter, which occurred as we expected. The good news is that following a substantial sales decline in April, we saw a decelerating rate of sales decline in each months of the second quarter. However, the return to monthly sales growth is taking longer than we expected. Department stores in Japan have reported that they have also been experiencing sequentially smaller rates of sales declines in jewelry sales in the past several months.", "Reflecting the volatility in Japan, total sales declined 13% in the second quarter due to lower unit volume in all jewelry categories. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales declined 10% and comp store sales declined 13%. However, keep in mind that the 13% comp decline followed a 30% increase in the first quarter and was on top of an 8% comp increase in last year\u2019s second quarter. We do expect to return to single digit sales growth in Japan but have not yet done so in the first few weeks of August. We did not add any new locations in Japan during the quarter but we do plan to open a freestanding store in Shinjuku later this year.", "Total sales in Europe increased 8% in the second quarter but the sales growth largely reflected the translation benefits from the stronger pound and euro versus the dollar. Looking at results on a constant exchange rate basis, total sales were up just 1% with higher jewelry unit volume offsetting lower average price and comp store sales declined 8%. This was a further slowdown from the 3% comp decline we had in the first quarter but was on top of the 7% comp increase in last year\u2019s second quarter.", "In terms of market performance across Europe, most countries posted weak sales results. Although the UK\u2019s decline was greater than that of Continental Europe reflecting to some degree a decline in tourists spending in London. We think the weakness in the UK and to some degree on the Continent too might be resulting from the strength of the pound and euro which perhaps could also be enticing Europeans to shop in the U.S. and elsewhere. As most of you know a few months ago we expanded Tiffany\u2019s presence in Paris to a fourth location when we opened the major store on the Champs Elysees, which is serving fine visitors and local shoppers as well.", "In fact and not too surprisingly that store is quickly becoming one of our highest sales volume stores in Europe. All in all we believe Tiffany is still feeling the effects of both economic and currency related challenges in Europe although we are partially benefiting in the U.S. from European tourist spending. But longer term we are as excited as ever about Tiffany\u2019s expansion plans and growth potential in Europe.", "Wrapping up the regional sales review as our other segment where the bulk of the 28% sales increase in the second quarter was from retail sales largely from the opening of our store in Moscow in February as well as from 2% comp store sales growth in our five stores in the UAE. In addition, there was an increase in wholesale sales of diamond acquired through our rough sourcing program and subsequently sold because they don\u2019t meet our requirements. Although, we had thought wholesale sales would have been higher in the quarter and therefore would have more negatively affected gross margin. Our websites around the world effectively complement our worldwide store base and e-commerce sales have been growing roughly in line with our overall worldwide sales. Of course beyond generating online sales, our website service powerful marketing vehicle to build brand and product awareness and drive store traffic.", "To summarize various worldwide store expansion plans I mentioned in each region we are now expecting to open 10 stores in 2014 instead of the initial plan that called for 13 stores with the reduction due to the delays in opening two stores planned in China a store planned in Bangkok. Also we now plan to close three stores this year instead of our initial intention to close four because the store in Japan will be relocated within its host department store instead of being closed. In total, this represents a net 2% increase in company operated locations and a net 3% increase in gross square footage.", "In addition to our strategy to gradually expand our company operated store base we are of course also renovating older stores with the objective to enhance visual merchandizing and the in store customer experience and to achieve the most effective space utilization.", "So that wraps up the regional sales review. There are number of noteworthy highlights among our product categories with the key takeaway has been continued strength at mid-to-higher price points and healthy growth in both perennial classics and newer designs. Specifically, in the statement, fine and solitaire jewelry category, we enjoyed strong statement jewelry sales in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions resulting in part from customers who may have attended our successful Blue Book event in New York in April.", "There was also healthy increase in fine jewelry sales in all regions, excluding Japan which of course had an exceptional first quarter increase. Fine jewelry highlights include the ongoing success of our Yellow Diamond collection, Elsa Peretti Diamonds by the Yard collection and our important Victoria collection. We\u2019ve spoken for some time now about the increasing popularity of colored diamonds and other gemstones and our design initiatives in recent years have addressed that growing interest.", "In our fashion jewelry category, which primarily includes jewelry without gemstones, we\u2019re seeing particular strength in gold jewelry in a number of collections. Total silver jewelry sales were unchanged from the year ago as growth in higher-end silver pieces offset softness at entry level price point. The biggest story, as we noted since last fall, is the tremendous success of our Atlas jewelry collection introduce the best time and expanded with additional pieces in the spring.", "And another popular collection demonstrating timelessness of design after many years in our assortment is our Return to Tiffany collection. Two very popular collections that span the fashion in fine jewelry categories at Tiffany Keys, which has been expanded with diamond accents and our Enchant collection which has been expanded into designs incorporating the RUBEDO metal. ", "Lastly, the engagement jewelry and wedding band category was strong especially in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions, led of course by our extraordinary Tiffany solitaire diamond ring and we\u2019re delighted with the growing popularity of our relatively new harmony engagement collection.", "Looking forward, we are excited about the launch of our new Tiffany T jewelry collection. Tiffany T is being offered in a range of materials with the majority of styles in yellow, white or rose gold with and without diamonds as well as some pieces in sterling silver making the collection available in a wide range of prices from a few hundred dollars up to about $20,000. This collection have more than 50 styles was introduced last week in our U.S. Canadian and Latin American stores and will be available globally in September.", "You may have seen new advertising, now appearing in magazines and on tiffany.com. That\u2019s just the start of the campaign and we intend to substantially step up ad spending in the third quarter to promote awareness of this dramatic new collection. ", "Lastly, outside of jewelry, we\u2019re excited to be launching in the coming weeks a beautiful and elegant new collection of hand bags and small leather goods. The tightly focused assortment reflects a new modern aesthetic intended to attract and appeal the fashion-focused existing and new customers.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ralph to review the rest of the earnings statement, the balance sheet and our full year expectations. Ralph.", "Ralph Nicoletti", "Thank you, Mark. Clearly, we had a strong quarter reflecting solid execution of our strategies in a volatile global environment. The key takeaways driving results were broad base sales growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific more than offsetting the expected decline in Japan and softness in Europe.", "Sales strength across all key product categories and price strata and highlighted by improving fashion jewelry sales, a meaningful increase in gross margin and strong operating earnings growth while increasing our marketing investment. Factoring in the results from the second quarter, tempered with a bit of caution because of Europe and Japan and a generally uncertain global environment, we are raising our full year earnings forecast by $0.05 per share, representing a portion of the second quarters better than expected net earnings.", "Now I\u2019ll comment on the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin rose 2.4 points to 59.9% in the second quarter, largely due to favorable product costs and price increases taken across all product categories and regions. And to a lesser extent some sales leverage on fixed costs. Additionally, we are pleased to see fashion jewelry sales grow in line with total company sales which contributed to the margin exceeding our expectations. Gross margin also benefited versus our forecast from a lower than expected level of wholesale sales of diamonds.", "We saw a 9% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter primarily reflecting higher fixed and variable labor and store-related cost. In addition, marketing spending rose in the quarter and we expect the year-over-year growth to accelerate further in the second half of the year, but especially in the third quarter tied to the launch of the Tiffany T collection. In fact, while marketing spending in the first half of the year was about unchanged from the prior year, we are planning for to increase year-over-year by a double digit percentage in the second half. ", "While SG&A expenses rose a bit more than sales growth in the second quarter, we continue to expect that that rate of SG&A expense growth will be less than sales growth for the full year.", "As a result of the increases in sales and gross margin operating earnings increased 18% in the quarter while the operating margin rose to 21% from 19% in last year\u2019s second quarter. Interest and other expenses net of $16 million in the quarter were about a $1 million above last year and the effective income tax rate of 35.5% in the quarter was 1.3 points above last year but that was largely due to a one-time effect of a change in certain state tax legislation.", "Adding it all up, net earnings in the second quarter increased 16% to $124 million or $0.96 per share. Tiffany\u2019s strong balance sheet gives us a solid foundation to support our current business and planned growth. At the end of the second quarter we had $398 million of cash and cash equivalents versus $490 million a year ago and our debt leverage remains essentially unchanged. Inventories of $2.5 billion at July 31 were up 9% from a year ago, partly to support overall anticipated sales growth but with disproportionate increases in raw materials and work in process inventories partly to support the launch of the Tiffany T collection. ", "Our full year and longer term objective continues to call for maintaining inventory growth less than the rate of sales growth. ", "Capital expenditures of $91 million in the first half were up just slightly from last year\u2019s first half. For the full year, we continue to forecast CapEx at $270 million versus the $220 million last year reflecting incremental investments in information technology including the global customer relationship management system and more advanced order and inventory management capabilities.", "In terms of share repurchases during the quarter, we spent approximately $9 million to repurchase 102,000 shares at an average cost of approximately $91 a share. There was $284 million available for future repurchases under a $300 million three-year program that was authorized by Tiffany\u2019s Board of Directors in March. ", "As Mark mentioned, Tiffany\u2019s Board increased the quarterly dividend rate by 12% in the second quarter reflecting our longer term objective to grow dividends roughly in line with earnings growth and thus maintaining the current payout ratio.", "Let\u2019s now look at our outlook for the full year. We began 2014 projecting net earnings in the range of $4.05 to $4.15 per share or 9% to 11% higher than the adjusted $3.73 per share that was earned in 2013. When we reported strong first quarter results, we increased the forecasted range by $0.10 per share. ", "Now, based on performance in the second quarter but tempered by macro uncertainties and specifically the continued softness in Europe and the lingering sales declines in Japan, we are raising our forecasted range by $0.05 to $4.20 to $4.30 per share which will represent full year EPS growth of 13% to 15%.", "That full year forecast continues to call for a high single digit percentage increase in worldwide net sales in dollars and we expect a healthy increase in the operating margin for the full year coming from a higher gross margin but factoring in gross margin in the second half being up less than in the first half. And we expect some improvement in the SG&A expense ratio for the year despite the considerably higher marketing spending.", "Summing up, Tiffany\u2019s performance in the first half of the year was quite good in most respects although a bit more volatile than we expected. With our growing store base, compelling product designs and new advertising, we believe we are nicely positioned for a successful second half of the year.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Mark.", "Mark Aaron", "Thanks Ralph.

(NYSE:TIF) Q4 2014 Results Earnings Conference Call March 20, 2015  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Frederic Cumenal - President", "Ralph Nicoletti - EVP and CFO", "Mark Aaron - VP of IR", "Analysts", "Operator", "Good day, everyone and welcome to the Tiffany & Company Fourth Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today's call is Mr. Frederic Cumenal, President, Mr. Ralph Nicoletti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark Aaron", "Thank you. Greetings from New York, and hello everyone. We reported Tiffany's fourth quarter and full year results this morning and I presume you've already had a chance to review the news release. On today's call, Ralph and I will comment on those results and Tiffany's 2015 plans and outlook. And we are pleased to have Frederic join us, to wrap up the call with some strategic observations.", "Before continuing, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.", "Okay. Let's begin with an overview of fourth quarter results. Sales performance by region was mostly inline with the holiday sales results we've reported on January 12. Net worldwide sales in the fourth quarter declined 1% but rose 3% on a constant exchange rate basis that excludes the translation effect of the stronger U.S. dollar. We expect to see a continuation of that substantial headwind from the strong dollar in 2015.", "In local currencies we were pleased that Tiffany performed well in Europe and Asia Pacific and not surprised that we experienced softness in Japan. However, we were disciplined with the underperformance in the Americas.", "Also in the fourth quarter the operating margin was down slightly from last year's margin excluding the charge, while growth margin increased in the quarter the improvement was offset by higher marketing spending and deleveraging of SG&A fixed costs.", "Interest and other expenses net were above last year but the prior year included a one time foreign currency transaction gain. The effective tax rate was below last year. So in total net earnings of a $1.51 per diluted share in the fourth quarter was up slightly from last year's $1.47 excluding charges and at the high end of the forecast we provided in January.", "For all of 2014, worldwide net sales rose to $4.25 billion. That represented a 5% increase in dollars or a 7% increase on a constant exchange rate basis which was on top of a 10% increase in 2013 on that same basis.", "Net earnings for the full year rose 167% to $484 million or $3.73 per diluted share. However, on an apples-to-apples basis excluding charges in both years, net earnings rose 13% and EPS of $4.20 was slightly better than the original guidance of $4.05 to $4.15 that we published at this time a year ago. And that 13% earnings increase in 2014 was on top of the non-GAAP 15% increase in net earnings that we achieved in 2013.", "Let's now look at the details of our regional sales performance. First, there were minimal changes in our regional sales mix in 2014. The Americas represented 48% of worldwide net sales in 2014 unchanged from 2013.", "Asia Pacific was 24% of worldwide sales, up slightly from 23% a year ago. Japan was 13% down slightly from 14% in 2013, and that was largely due to currency translation and Europe at 12% of worldwide sales was unchanged.", "Let's look at the Americas which had a good year but finished on a soft note. On a constant exchange rate basis, both total sales and comp store sales were unchanged in the fourth quarter versus a 7% comp increase last year. However, for the full year on a constant exchange rate basis, total sales and comps rose 6% on top of a 3% comp increase in 2013.", "In dollars, total sales in the Americas declined 1% in the quarter due to lower units sold offsetting favorable average price and mix. A 6% sales increase in the full year reflected favorable average price in mix currently offset by jewelry unit declines in silver jewelry under $500.", "The strong U.S. dollar had a minimal negative translation effect on the Americas sales but is having an adverse effect on foreign tourists spending in the U.S. especially in New York. And this effect certainly worsened in the later part of 2014.", "Foreign tourist spending has historically represented about a quarter of annual U.S. sales. Although we no longer can precisely measure it due to privacy laws in some large markets but we can safely say it is the meaningful portion of the regional sale. And in fact continue to represent more than 40% of sales in the New York flagship store in 2014.", "We attribute the Americas comp decline in the fourth quarter to softness that was broad based geographically across the U.S. and in most product categories except fashion jewelry. On a related note, while the Tiffany T collection preformed very well, it is possible that the concentrated advertising focus on that collection may not have benefited other collections as we had expected.", "We attribute the softness in the under $500 silver jewelry category to a lack of product newness and marketing focus and perhaps also the competitive and macro pressures on the jewelry purchaser at those price points. So we do have some opportunity to fine tune our approaches to those issues within our control.", "Elsewhere in the Americas, we were pleased with solid total sales growth in Canada and Latin America on a constant exchange rate basis in both the fourth quarter and the full year.", "We finished the year operating a 122 Tiffany stores in the Americas versus 121 at the end of 2013. During the year we opened three stores in the region on Boston\u2019s Newbury Street, in Florida\u2019s, Aventura mall and in Cancun, Mexico and we closed two small stores in East Hampton, New York, and in the whole ran through department store in Ottawa, Canada. Already in early February, we've opened a stunning store in the new Miami Design District.", "Let\u2019s now turn to the Asia Pacific region. On a constant exchange rate basis total sales rose 7% in the quarter and comp rose 3% on top of a 4% comp increase in last years quarter. While the full year, total sales rose 10% and comps rose 4% on top of an 11% comp increase in 2013.", "Translated into U.S. dollars, Asia Pacific sales increased 4% in the fourth quarter due to favorable average price in mix partly offset by some unit declines. Sales in the full year rose 9% due to favorable average jewelry pricing mix as well as higher jewelry units sold.", "Quarterly sales performance in Asia Pacific on a constant exchange rate basis was led by strong growth in China, Australia and Singapore, partly offset by softness in Hong Kong. While for the full year we were pleased to achieve broad based growth in most countries.", "Sales in greater China was a total of 45 stores in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau continue to represent more than half of Asia Pacific region sales in 2014.", "Starting in the third quarter, Tiffany has seen a mark softening in sales results in Hong Kong and we're also experiencing weakness in Macau. We believe that some tourists may be diverting their travels to other markets or perhaps increasing their spending locally.", "So we concluded 2014 operating 73 Tiffany stores in the Asia Pacific region versus 72 at the end of the 2013. Opening only one store in this region during the year in Adelaide, Australia is not indicative of our planned rate of annual expansion. However three stores that we have planned to open in the region last year were temporarily delayed.", "Two of those stores in China in the MixC mall in Hangzhou, and in the New World Daimaru Department Store in Shanghai have already opened this year. It was certainly a volatile year for us in Japan, dealing with the effect of an increase in the consumption tax on April 1, followed by the effect of a weakening Yen and then an economic recession.", "When measured in Yen, total sales in Japan increased 1% in the fourth quarter due to favorability in average pricing mix, mostly offset by decline in jewelry units sold.", "For the full year, a 4% total sales increase in Yen was due to favorable price and mix also partly offset by a decline in jewelry units sold. Comp store sales declined 5% in Yen in the quarter versus an 8% increase in last year\u2019s fourth quarter and comps increased 1% for the full year versus a 10% increase in 2013.", "So while we definitely had our challenges in Japan in 2014, we believe our two year run rate is respectable.", "The Yen weakened 8% on average against the U.S. dollar in 2014 and that's after weakening about 20% on average in 2013.", "Therefore when translated into dollars, total sales in Japan declined 13% in the fourth quarter and 4% for the full year. Such a substantial move in the Yen has clearly caused softness and spending by Japanese tourists when they travel but might be supporting some local spending in Japan.", "In addition although we have seen a gradual increase in spending by Chinese tourists in Japan, overall spending by foreign tourists visiting Japan is still not yet meaningful for us. During 2014, we opened two stores in Japan in Kobe and in the Shinjuku section of Tokyo and finished the year operating 56 Tiffany stores.", "Now turning to Europe, we also faced some macro economic challenges but nonetheless performed well. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales rose 9% in the fourth quarter led by growth in our three major continental European markets of Germany, Italy, and France and comp store sales rose 4%. Our net basis for the full year total sales rose 6% but comp stores declined 1%.", "Sales in the U.K. represented about 40% of total Europe in 2014 and its performance was relatively softer than Continental Europe in both the quarter and full year.", "The Euro and the Pound weakened against the U.S. dollar in 2014. Therefore when translated into U.S. dollars, total European sales in the fourth quarter were flat with the prior year with no significant changes in jewelry units sold, price or mix, while conversely for the full year, total sales rose 6% due to similar favorability in jewelry units sold average price and mix.", "Those weaker currencies have likely contributed to the attractiveness of shopping in Europe and foreign tourist spending represents approximately a quarter of our European sales.", "During 2014, we expanded Tiffany's presence in Paris with the opening of the major store on the important Champs Elysees. The prominent point of location is enjoying a successful first year serving foreign tourists as well as for Asians and it has been important complement to Tiffany's other stores on Rue de La Paix and in the galleries Lafayette and Printemps department stores. We finished the year operating 38 stores in Europe.", "Rounding out the geographies is our other segment which primarily consist the retail store sales in the United Arab Emirates and Russia, as well as wholesale diamond sales and some licensing revenues.", "In the fourth quarter, other sales increased 12% due to incremental sales from our store that we opened in Moscow in February 2014, while comp store sales declined 8% due to soft demand in the five stores we operate in UAE. Although I should add that this compared with the strong 23% comp increase in last year\u2019s fourth quarter.", "For the full year, other sales rose 26% partly due to the Moscow store sales as well as an 8% increase in comp store sales. So in total, we opened eight company operated Tiffany & Co stores in 2014 and closed two.", "That net addition of six stores was a 2% increase in our store base and a 3% increase in worldwide square footage. You should also keep in mind that beyond opening new stores we are equally focused on enhancing the quality of our existing store base and as such we will be pursuing a number of relocations and some major renovations in 2015.", "We are currently planning to increase our company operated stores by a net of approximately 12 to 15 stores during 2015. A majority of that net addition is planned in Asia Pacific with the balance in the Americas and Europe. In total, this will represent a 4% to 5% net increase in our company operated store base and in worldwide square footage.", "Looking at regional sales productivity in 2014, total sales and dollars per growth square foot for company operated stores was unchanged at approximately $3100. By region, the ranking remained unchanged from the prior year with Asia Pacific continuing to rank highest with $5,000 productivity versus $4800 in 2013, followed by Japan at $3400 versus $3800 in 2013, then Europe at $3200 down from $3300 in 2013, to the Americas at $2500 per square foot up from $2400 in 2013.", "At this point it's also worth mentioning the effectiveness of Tiffany's omni-channel platform. Our company operated store base as complemented by e-commerce enabled websites in 13 countries and informational sites in several others.", "We have a dual objective of generating ecommerce sales growth in each region, but importantly also communicating Tiffany's brand and product message to consumers in order to drive store traffic as well. Total e-commerce sales continue to represent 6% of net worldwide sales in 2014.", "There was a noteworthy merchandising highlights in 2014. First, we were pleased to experience growth in all major categories for the year led by growth in our fashion jewelry categories and specifically in gold jewelry.", "We also saw a healthy growth in engagement jewelry in 2014, but only modest growth in the statement fine and solitaire category. From a worldwide price stratification perspective there was sales growth in every price strata above $500, up to statement jewelry above $50,000.", "Following on the successful launch in 2013 is the exciting reinterpretation of our Atlas collection, our design team created another success with their modern innovative new Tiffany T collection.", "Ranging in price from a few hundred dollars to $20,000, the Tiffany T collection is targeted towards stylish female self purchase customers, as well as attracting gift purchasers. And as intended its appeal is global.", "Consistent with our brand strategy, it's worth noting that Tiffany T continues our evolution toward introducing compelling designs at higher price points. And in its first few months, is generating the highest ever average transaction size for a new fashion jewelry collection at Tiffany.", "On a related note, while both Atlas and Tiffany T incorporate the use of various precious metals, we have seen a clear preference for the gold design. In fact that trend is evidenced throughout the fashion jewelry category, with considerable strength in gold jewelry sales being partly offset by the softness in silver jewelry sales especially in that price strata under $500.", "I should also call up the resurgence of our Keys collection originally introduced in 2009 but expanded over the past two years with a beautiful new designs incorporating colored gemstones as well as rose gold.", "I mentioned sales growth in the engagement jewelry category, which is led of course by the popularity of our iconic six pronged setting. A strong addition to the engagement category has been the harmony engagement ring, which in just over two years has become our second best selling style in our bridal assortment. And sales of wedding band rings in the engagement category were strong in the year.", "Overall our sales growth in the engagement category was led by strength in the Asia Pacific and the Americas regions. The more modest sales increased in fine and solitaire jewelry in 2014 was spread among various collections and designs.", "With noteworthy callouts being the classic Victoria collection with new styles added in 2014, and the beautiful Soleste collection, which is diamond-focused and was expanded in 2014 to incorporate greater use of colored stones.", "As on aside and a possible explanation for some of the softness in fine and solitaire jewelry sales, especially in the fourth quarter, we've heard anecdotal speculation that strong demand for the Tiffany T collection may have pulled some demand from the fine jewelry category.", "Lastly, while there was plenty of activity in high-end statement jewelry in 2014, worldwide sales of that category were about equal to the prior year's level.", "I hope you now have a better understanding of Tiffany's top line performance in 2014, and I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Ralph.", "Ralph Nicoletti", "Thank you, Mark for that comprehensive sales review. Reflecting on 2014, I'd like to highlight a few important points before getting into the specifics.", "We are effectively executing our strategies to continue to strengthen and elevate the Tiffany brand. In 2014, we expanded our global footprint in key locations, we strengthened our position in the important fashion jewelry category with the introduction of the Tiffany T collection, and we advanced key product development initiatives for introduction in 2015 and beyond.", "We improved gross margin and operating margin, while increasing our investment in marketing. And we strengthened or balance sheet by keeping our inventory growth to a lower rate in sales growth, and we lowered our cost of debt significantly, while extending maturities and generating strong free cash flow.", "As we exited 2014, we were clearly facing challenges in 2015 from the strong U.S. dollar. Tourist purchases are expected to continue to be pressured in Americas, gross margin is expected to improve in 2015, but at a lesser rate than in 2014, and negative translation is expected to continue to mute sales and earnings growth.", "However, we have the ability to continue to invest in the Tiffany brand and improve our capabilities to continue to deliver value for our shareholders over time.", "Now that I've framed that overall message, let's take a look at the rest of the components in the earning statement that, excluding charges in 2014 and 2013, contributed to deliver our -- contributed to our delivering the 13% increase in net earnings for the full year.", "Gross margin in the year rose 1.6 points to 59.7%, benefiting from favorable product input cost, price increases taken earlier in the year, and a sales mix that moved favorably toward our higher margin fashion jewelry category later in the year.", "Gross margin in the fourth quarter was three-tenth of a point higher than the prior year. We're continuing to experience some benefit from favorable product input costs, which we believe will help gross margin in 2015.", "From a pricing perspective, the substantial weakening of the yen, euro and pound would normally result in our taking price increases in those regions to fully offset the negative impacts. However, in light of the magnitude of those currency swings and considering local conditions, we are taking only measured price increases in this first quarter. As a result, we expect a modest increase in gross margin in 2015.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6% in the full year, partly due to a combination of higher labor and other store related cost, as well as a substantial increase as expected in marketing spending.", "In fact, for the full year, we increased marketing spending to 6.7% of net sales from 6.3% in 2013. SG&A expenses rose only 1% in the fourth quarter as higher marketing spending was mostly offset by the translation effect of the strong U.S. dollar.", "I think most of you know that about 80% of our SG&A expenses are fixed in nature. And we have said that we require a mid-single-digit comp store sales increase to gain leverage on those costs. Therefore, our sales growth in 2014 was not sufficient to achieve the leverage on those costs.", "Based on our current sales outlook, we expect SG&A expenses will increase at a greater rate than sales growth in 2015. This expected increase in the expense ratio partially reflects our store expansion and marketing plans, but also reflects a meaningful increase of approximately $30 million of non-cash expense resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions, principally reflecting lower interest rates for our U.S. pension and post retiring benefit plans. In fact, that $30 million increase alone restrains EPS growth in 2015 by $0.15 per diluted share.", "Operating earnings on a non-GAAP basis declined 3% in the fourth quarter and rose 12% in the full year when excluding the arbitration charge in 2013, as well as a smaller expense in that year related to staffing and occupancy reductions.", "The operating margin rose to 21% in the full year 2014 versus an adjusted 19.7% in 2013 and a margin of 18.4% in 2012. Our expectation calls for operating earnings in 2015 to be about equal to the prior year.", "As you probably know, we have redeemed $400 million of long-term debt in the third quarter and issued $550 million of debt. This was a significant step in lowering our interest cost and extending maturities.", "The net effect of these debt transactions was a $15 million reduction in interest expense, or $3 million to $4 million per quarter, which we began to experience in the fourth quarter, and is incorporated in our full year projection of approximately $50 million of interest and other expense in 2015.", "The effective tax rate was 32.9% in the fourth quarter and 34.4% in the full year. The effective tax rates in 2013 were 36.1% in the fourth quarter and 34.8% in the full year, when excluding the charge for the inverse arbitration ruling. We expect the effective tax rate in 2015 to be about equivalent to the rate in 2014.", "So, adding it all up, net earnings were $196 million in the fourth quarter and were 3% higher than net earnings of $190 million in last year's fourth quarter, excluding the arbitration related charge.", "For the full year, net earnings were $484 million or $3.73 per share, compared with $181 million or $1.41 per diluted share in the prior year. However, excluding those charges in both years, net earnings rose 13% to $545 million or $4.20 per share, up from $481 million or $3.73 per share in 2013.", "Our balance sheet was strong at January 31, 2015. Net inventories rose 2% in 2014 to finish the year at $2.4 billion. The overall increase supported new stores, product introductions and expanded offerings, and we were pleased with the level of inventory availability in our stores.", "The 2% increase included a 4% increase in finished goods and a 2% decrease in combined raw materials and work in process inventories. Inventories would have grown 6% and still below to the rate of sales growth, excluding the effect of foreign currency translation.", "In addition, I believe you all understand that the year-end inventory level was impacted by the unanticipated sales softness in the fourth quarter.", "So, whether measured in dollars or on a constant exchange rate basis, both the 2% and 6% increases respectively met our long-term objective to keep growth and inventories below sales growth. Our 2015 plan calls for minimal inventory growth in dollars in the full year.", "Accounts receivable rose 3% in 2014 to $195 million, in line with sales growth. Receivables are turning at 21 times per year. Capital expenditures were $247 million in 2014. That was an increase from $221 million in 2013 due to increased spending on systems and internal manufacturing capacity.", "CapEx was 6% of worldwide net sales versus 5% in the prior year. Approximately half of our capital spending goes towards store openings, renovations, and relocations. We are forecasting CapEx around $260 million for 2015.", "We spent $5 million in the fourth quarter to repurchase 53,000 shares. In the full year, we spent $27 million and bought 301,000 shares at an average cost just under $90 per share. At year end, we had $273 million available for future repurchases under the current authorization that runs through March of 2017.", "We believe that share repurchases and dividend growth are appropriate long-term measures to return excess cash to shareholders. Putting it all together, we generated free cash flow of $368 million which included the effect of $61 million after-tax debt extinguishment charge and expect to generate free cash flow exceeding $400 million in 2015.", "We finished 2014 with a solid balance sheet and liquidity. Total short term and long-term debt was $1.1 billion with 39% of six stockholders equity versus $1 billion and 37% a year ago.", "Tiffany\u2019s return on assets and stockholders equity were 10% and 17% respectively in 2014 and clearly meeting our long-term objectives for at least 10% ROA and a 15% ROE.", "Turning to our financial forecasts for 2015, I've already highlighted our assumptions for the operating margin, interest and other expenses and the effective tax rate. In terms of our sales forecast, we believe that taking a cautious view in certain markets is appropriate in light of what we saw in the fourth quarter specifically the strength of the U.S. dollar, as well as challenging conditions in certain markets.", "In total we are planning a mid single digit percent increase in worldwide net sales in local currencies which would translate into low single digit increase in dollars for the full year.", "While we don\u2019t typically talk about quarterly forecasts, we think you should be aware that we have a very difficult comparison in Japan to a 30% comp increase in last year's first quarter. And we have also continued to experience softness in the Americas, both of which will contribute to a forecasted 10% sales decline in the first quarter on a reported basis in U.S. dollars.", "Combined with our assumptions for operating margin interest expense and the effective tax rate, we are forecasting minimal growth in the full year EPS over the $4.20 per share excluding charges that Tiffany earned in 2014.", "This was not indicative in any way of Tiffany's long-term earnings power, but it is a reflection of the various near-in macro challenges currently affecting us.", "As I mentioned, the expected minimal EPS growth in 2015 incorporates the non-cash increase in employee benefit related expenses costing $0.15 per share or about 4% of earnings growth and of course it\u2019s safe to add that the strong U.S. dollar is costing us a few percentage points of earnings growth. So without those two factors we would have been looking at high single digit increase in EPS.", "The change between our original preliminary 2015 guidance that we provided in January calling for low to mid single digit increase in net earnings for the year and our current forecast of minimal earnings growth in 2015, is essentially the result of the added non-cash pension expense and the further strengthening of the U.S. dollar since then.", "I would now like to highlight the phasing of our expected sales and earnings in 2015 which will be affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Japan's volatility in 2014 and the timing of marketing spending.", "From a quarterly perspective based on the top line challenges in this first quarter, we expect that first quarter EPS could be 30% lower than the $0.97 we\u2019ve earned last year, which had represented a 49% increase over the prior year.", "We expect that the second quarter will also show a net earnings decline, but at a more modest rate pressured by the continuation of the strong dollar and substantial marketing spending tied to the watch launch.", "And then we expect net earnings to grow by double-digit percentages in both the third and fourth quarters. So just to make it clear, our sales and earnings plan assume progressively improving performance as we move through the year.", "In conclusion, I joined Tiffany just about a year ago, since then we\u2019ve been focusing on a number of fronts including but not limited to effectively allocating resources for growth, driving improvements in cost and inventory management, and doing all of this in a tax efficient manner. I\u2019m very excited about our opportunities to grow Tiffany's business in increasingly profitable and productive way.", "I presume you all are aware that Tiffany's Chief Executive Officer, Mike Kowalski, will be retiring from Tiffany on March 31, and remain as non-Executive Chairman of the Board. On April 1, Frederic Cumenal, currently Tiffany's President will become CEO.", "I am now very pleased to turn the call over to Frederic.", "Frederic Cumenal", "Thanks Ralph. Thanks Ralph and Mark and good morning everyone. I'm glad to have this opportunity to briefly share with you my thoughts about Tiffany's business and our exciting plan.", "First, I believe we achieved good financial results in 2014, but certainly finished the year on a disappointing note primary in the Americas. While we know about the unavoidable challenges rising from the strong US dollar, we can and we\u2019ll be nimble in fine-tuning product developments and marketing communications.", "Most important, we have a clear roadmap for the future focused on the store experience, products, marketing, logistics, and margin improvement. I\u2019m pleased with the progress that our company made in 2014 in these areas that I believe will drive our longer term success.", "That strategic direction focuses on continued elevation as a global luxury brand. In our stores, we are striving to better engage customers through a more consultative approach and with enhanced visual merchandising presentation.", "Over the next couple of years, we would strengthen our abilities when we finish developing a global CRM system and are able to better analyze our customer base and shopping partners.", "We opened some major stores in key markets in 2014 and I'm particularly speaking of the new ones in Paris and Moscow. Our strategy includes further investing in our distribution base with new stores likely at the rate of 10 to 15 stores per year when we find the right opportunities, but also enhancing the impressions we create with customers through renovations, relocations, and even some select clothing's.", "In 2014, we increased our focus on the stylish female sales purchase customer when we introduced the dramatic and innovative Tiffany T collection, following the successfully debut in 2013 of our reinterpreted Atlas collection.", "Our strategy includes launching additional collections in the coming years. But our design group will also be refreshing our product assortments with important new interpretations of our iconic collections.", "In April, we will proudly introduce to the world CT-60 a major new collection of watches as the first step in a long-term investment to be a meaningful watch business.", "To enhance our growth potential last year, our talented marketing team further developed impactful messages of customer relevance. Operationally, we've continued to expand our capabilities in manufacturing and sourcing, while focused on maximizing the efficiencies of that supply chain, which should enable us to further improve our gross margins in the coming years.", "From an IT perspective, we're continuing to invest in new systems to support our long-term objectives. So we enter 2015 with many plans but also with the cautious short-term view regarding the external challenges and uncertainties affecting our business.", "We believe that planning for modest sales growth and minimal earning growth is both prudent and justifiable. However, we remain constantly focused on that strategic roadmap I referred you by investing in various facets of our business to achieve healthy results over the long term.", "We have made key additions to our management team in the past couple of years both in New York and in our regions which reinforces my confidence and our ability to achieve our long term goal.", "Tiffany has accumulated an amazing heritage since its funding 178 years ago. Our roots are here in New York and now we have the opportunity to be relevant and prosper in a world where growing number of affluent customers are seeking finally crafted products and extraordinary experiences.", "That concludes my comments. I appreciate your interest in Tiffany and we will now turn the call back to Mark.", "Mark Aaron", "Thank you, Frederick and Ralph. We hope our remarks on this call have enhanced your understanding of our financial results, plans for the coming year, and longer term direction.", "A replay of the call is available on our website or by dialing 888-203-1112 in the U.S. or 719-457-0820 outside the U.S. and entering passcode 8682508.

(NYSE:TIF) Q1 2015 Results Earnings Conference Call May 27, 2015  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Ralph Nicoletti \u2013 EVP and CFO", "Mark Aaron - VP, Investor Relations", "Analysts", "Operator", "Please standby. Good day, everyone. And welcome to the Tiffany & Company First Quarter Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. Participating on today's call is Ralph Nicoletti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark Aaron", "Thank you. Good day and greetings from our New York headquarters. Earlier today we reported Tiffany's first quarter results and I hope by now you\u2019ve had chance to review the news release. On today's call, Ralph and I will comment on those results and how they are linked to our growth strategies, and then wrap up the call with a few comments on the outlook for the rest of the year.", "Before continuing, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements.", "Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.", "Okay. Starting with the first quarter overview, while, results were admittedly far from robust, they did exceed our expectations and we were pleased with continued progress in executing our key store, product and marketing-related initiatives.", "Net worldwide sales declined 5% in the first quarter, which was better than the 10% decline we had expected, due to strong performance in Europe and a smaller than anticipated year-over-year decline in Japan. On a constant exchange rate basis excluding the translation effect of the strong U.S. dollar, worldwide net sales increased 1%.", "Going from a 5% sales decline as reported to a 1% sales increase on a constant exchange rate basis, shows just how much of a headwind we are feeling from the strong U.S. dollar in translation alone. We expect that to continue to one degree or another for the remainder of the year.", "Regional total sales performance again on a constant exchange rate basis ranged from a 21% increase in Europe, benefiting from strong foreign tourist and local customers spending there to an 18% decline in Japan after a surge in spending there in last year's first quarter.", "In addition, we continued to experience solid growth in fashion jewelry sales highlighted by the Tiffany T collection. We enjoyed growth in statement jewelry sales and we began the rollout of our new CT60 watch collection.", "The operating margin decline but the higher gross margin was more than offset by higher fixed SG&A expenses, specifically higher marketing spending in support of our bridal category and the introduction of our new watches.", "In total, the better than expected sales performance resulted in net earnings declining 17% to $0.81 per diluted share, which again was better than our guidance that had call for an approximate 30% decline.", "Let\u2019s now look at regional sales performance. In the Americas on a constant exchange rate basis, total sales increased 3% and comp store sales rose 1% on top of an 8% comp increase in last year's first quarter.", "This minimal sales growth in the Americas reflected an increase in domestic spending, which was mostly offset by lower foreign tourist spending in the U.S., especially in New York, which we attribute to the strength of the U.S. dollar. Elsewhere in the Americas we achieved healthy sales growth in Canada and Latin America on a constant exchange rate basis.", "In dollars, the 1% increase in total Americas sales resulted from favorable average price and mix being largely offset by lower jewelry unit volume tied to weakness at entry-level silver jewelry price points.", "We opened one store in the Americas during the quarter in the new Miami design district. We now operate 123 stores in the region with additional openings planned this year, including Tiffany's first store in Chile in Santiago this summer as well as another store in Canada in Ottawa.", "Performance in the Asia-Pacific region was mixed in the quarter. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales increased 4% and comp store sales increased 2%, compared with a 10% comp increase in last year's first quarter. We continue to see strong sales growth in China as well as in Australia and Singapore but we continued to experience softness in Hong Kong and Macau as we believe some Chinese tourists have been traveling to and shopping in other regions.", "Measured in U.S. dollars, Asia-Pacific sales declined 1% in the quarter. We experienced higher average price and mix which was outweighed by a decline in jewelry units sold in the region, reflecting the meaningful sales weaknesses in Hong Kong and in entry-level silver jewelry.", "During the first quarter, we opened two stores in China in Hangzhou and in Shanghai and finished the quarter, operating 75 Tiffany stores in the Asia-Pacific region. So far in the second quarter, we've opened a store in [Hangzhou] [ph], China and just today we opened in the newly expanded Galaxy Macau. We have additional openings planned for the rest of the year, including our first store in Thailand in Bangkok.", "Now let's turn to Japan where the focus in the quarter was frankly all about getting past a very difficult year-over-year comparison. In last year's first quarter, we achieved 30% comp store sales growth in yen when customer demand surged in anticipation of a consumption tax increase on April 1st. Though, it was not surprising to us that comp store sales in this year's first quarter declined 24% in yen.", "We now face easier year-over-year comparisons in Japan for the rest of the year. That 24% comp decline in yen in the quarter or 18% on a total sales basis was due to a substantial decline in jewelry units sold. The yen was 12% weaker on average than in the first quarter of last year. So when translated into dollars, total sales in Japan declined 30% in the first quarter.", "We believe such a substantial weakening of the yen has affected spending by Japanese tourists when they travel but might be supporting some local spending in Japan. In addition, we're benefiting in Japan from increasing spending by foreign tourists, especially from China.", "The store count in Japan was unchanged at 56 company-operated locations. All-in-all our business in Japan has experienced substantial volatility over the past year. And we definitely look forward to some stabilization going forward.", "In Europe, strong foreign tourist spending as well as higher local customer demand drove a substantial 21% increase in total sales on a constant exchange rate basis, with double-digit growth across most of continental Europe. Comp stores sales on the constant exchange rate basis rose 17%, compared with a 3% comp decline in last year's first quarter.", "The euro and the pound have weakened considerably against the U.S. dollar over the past year. And when translated into U.S. dollars, total sales in Europe rose 2% in the quarter, reflecting favorable price and mix, with total unit volume unchanged from last year but varying by category. Those weaker currencies have certainly made it increasingly attractive at the moment for foreign tourist to shop in Europe and Tiffany is benefiting from it.", "It was almost a year ago when we opened a major store in Paris on the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es, which is serving considerable numbers of foreign tourists and local customers too. We see significant long-term opportunities to further expand our company-operated store base in made for European markets.", "As examples, last week, we opened our first store in Geneva. The 550 square meter two-level store is located on the Rue du Rhone, marking our third store in Switzerland and 39th store in Europe. And later this year, we plan to open on the fashionable Via Condotti in Rome, representing Tiffany\u2019s third store in that important city.", "Lastly, sales in our other segment, which is a small component of our overall sales rose 1% in the quarter on a constant exchange rate basis with flat comps and declined 6% in dollars. This segment includes retail store sales in the United Arab Emirates and Russia, as well as wholesale diamond sales and some third-party licensing revenues.", "From a store expansion perspective, we remain on track to increase our company-operated stores by a net of approximately 12 to 15 stores this year. More than half of the openings are planned in Asia-Pacific, with the balance in the Americas and Europe. This represents a 4% to 5% net increase in our company-operated store base and in worldwide square footage.", "Beyond opening new stores, however, we are also pursuing a strategy to enhance the existing store base through renovations, as well as by relocating some stores to more favorable locations. In fact, we are scheduled for approximately 10 relocations this year and we're always focused on adding interesting and relevant content to our website that can also help to drive store traffic. We intend to be active in all of these areas in 2015, supporting our broader strategy to elevate the in-store and online experience and ultimately better engage and strengthen relationships with existing and new customers.", "In terms of noteworthy highlights within our product categories and collections, fashion jewelry was a strong performer in the quarter. The strength in fashion continued to be led by gold jewelry designs. A significant contributor to fashion jewelry sales is the TIFFANY T collection that we launched last fall. The collection continues to be well received by customers globally and is an important part of our strategy to expand our reach among style seeking self purchasers. And as we mentioned on our last call, TIFFANY T has been posting our highest ever transaction size for a new fashion collection.", "Also in fashion jewelry, our T\u2019s collection continues to perform quite well, especially benefiting from its expanded assortment. However, we continue to experience weakness in silver jewelry sales before $500. We are focused on addressing this issue over the balance of the year through product development and advertising targeted at what we call our little luxuries.", "Sales in the engagement jewelry and wedding bands category were soft year-over-year, with Japan accounting for most of the sales decline tied to the surge in spending in last year\u2019s first quarter. So going forward, we hope to see better performance in that category and we continue to be pleased with sales in the harmony collection and its recently expanded assortment.", "Spanning the engagement and the statement, fine and solitaire jewelry categories is our beautiful Soleste collection, which performed well in the quarter. In addition, we are planning to introduce some compelling additions to existing fine jewelry collections later this year to address softness in the fine jewelry category.", "In contrast to that softness in fine jewelry performance, we\u2019re very pleased with strong growth in statement jewelry sales in the quarter. In April, we hosted our Annual Blue Book event in New York with select customers in fashion media attending from around the world to see our new couture collection of magnificent jewelry with the theme, The Art of the Sea. It was a truly memorable and successful event.", "Rounding out the product review, in April we launched our CT60 collection of watches inspired by designs in Tiffany\u2019s archives. This brilliant collection is now being rolled out globally to Tiffany stores and consistent with our strategy, we are supporting the launch with extensive marketing to strengthen credibility and success in that category.", "While it\u2019s way too early to talk about results, we can say that initial reaction from customers and the media has been very good.", "In summary, we remain keenly focused on our key strategies surrounding stores, customer engagement, products and marketing.", "I will now turn the call over to Ralph to continue the financial and strategic review.", "Ralph Nicoletti", "Thank you, Mark, for the sales review. First, I would like to point out a few overall highlights of the quarter. The strong U.S. dollar was a significant headwind on the translation of results transacted outside the U.S., having a 6% negative effect on worldwide sales, as well as impacting foreign tourist spending in the U.S.", "Gross margin continued to improve as expected. We brought into our marketing focus beyond the Tiffany T collection with new engagement and watch campaigns. Our sales results contributed to a smaller than expected decline in net earnings.", "However, as it is early in the year and in light of continuing macro challenges and our assumptions about the direction of currency movements, we think it is prudent to maintain and not increase our earnings outlook for the year.", "Let\u2019s now take a look at the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin of 59.1% in the quarter was nine-tenths of a point higher than last year reflecting many factors. We continue to benefit to some degree from lower product input costs while also taking some single-digit price increases globally in the first quarter that partly offset the effect of the weaker foreign currencies.", "Part of the gross margin increase also came from the absence of a one-time charge that we incurred in last year\u2019s first quarter for the closing of a diamond polishing facility. In addition, the favorable effect from higher margin fashion jewelry sales was offset by solid growth in much lower margin statement jewelry sales as well as the sales decline in Japan, which had a negative effect on gross margin.", "We continue to expect a modest increase in gross margin in 2015 as those favorable product input costs diminished over the remainder of the year. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 5% in the quarter, largely due as expected to marketing spending partly tied to our new Will You? engagement campaign, and the launch of the CT60 watch collection.", "In addition, incremental U.S. pension and postretirement benefit cost affected the SG&A expense increase. We continue to expect that SG&A expenses will grow at a rate exceeding sales growth for the full year, reflecting the items that I just mentioned. The increased expense for our U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans will total approximately $30 million for the full year. However, we do expect some improvement in the ratio of SG&A expenses to sales in the second half of the year.", "Our forecast continues to reflect operating earnings for the full year approximately equal to the prior year. Interest and other expenses net declined in the quarter as expected from our debt refinancing in 2014. In addition to a lesser extent, we benefited from some year-over-year changes in foreign currency transaction gains.", "We continue to assume interest and other expenses net at approximately $50 million in 2015. The effective tax rate of 34.7% in the first quarter was slightly lower than the 35.1% rate in the first quarter of last year.", "We also continue to base our earnings forecast on an effective tax rate in 2015 virtually unchanged from last year\u2019s 34.4%. In total, we were projecting net earnings to decline 30% in the first quarter due to the pressures from the strong dollar, the difficult comparison in Japan and softness in the U.S. However, the smaller sales decline led to a smaller-than-expected 17% decline in net earnings.", "Although, let\u2019s keep in mind that the first quarter is the smallest quarter of the year. We\u2019re also pleased with the strength of Tiffany\u2019s balance sheet, which is consistent with our financial strategy. Cash and short-term investments totaled $715 million at April 30th. Short and long-term debt totaled almost $1.1 billion or 37% of stockholders equity versus 35% a year ago.", "We have more than adequate resources to support the growth of our business and to provide for potential opportunities to return some excess cash to shareholders. Net inventories of $2.4 billion at April 30th were 2% lower than a year ago.", "That overall decrease included a small increase in finished goods that was more than offset by a decline in combined raw material and work-in-process inventories. On a constant exchange basis, inventories would have increased 2%, due to new stores and product introductions.", "Our strategy for this year and over the long-term is to keep inventory growth below the rate of sales growth through better productivity in our stores, as well as in our overall supply chain. Accounts receivable of $192 million at April 30th was virtually unchanged from a year ago with receivable turnover staying at 21 times per year.", "Capital expenditures were $37 million in the first quarter versus $35 million a year ago. Our forecast continues to be based on CapEx at about $260 million for 2015, with considerable spending devoted to stores and for new IT systems, such as Global CRM and inventory management, among others.", "In terms of share repurchases, we spent $33 million in the first quarter to buy approximately 380,000 shares. At April 30th, we had approximately $240 million available for future repurchases under the current authorization that runs through March of 2017.", "On a trailing basis at April 30th, Tiffany's return on assets was 9% and the return on stockholders equity was 16%, both of which are close to our long-term objectives to achieve a minimum of 10% ROA and a 15% ROE.", "Before including my remarks, I want to comment on our full-year financial forecast. As I noted at the beginning of my remarks, we were pleased that the sales and earnings came in somewhat better than our expectations for the first quarter, but because it's still early in the year, we believe we should maintain our existing forecast in light of the strong dollar and lingering macro and market conditions and uncertainties.", "Our full year assumption of mid single-digit percentage worldwide sales increased on a constant exchange basis, assumes varying degrees of growth across all regions. However, we expect continued pressures from the strong dollar that may possibly only begin to abate much later in the year, if at all, resulting in a low single-digit full year worldwide sales increase when translated into dollars.", "Our unchanged forecast of minimal earnings growth versus the $4.20 per share we earned last year on a non-GAAP basis continues to incorporate an expected earnings decline in the second quarter at a more moderate rate than in the first quarter, as well as our assumptions of minimal sales growth, but higher growth in SG&A expense again tied to marketing spending.", "We then continue to expect double-digit earnings growth in the second half of the year. So it\u2019s a plan built on progressively improving sales and earnings performance as we move through the year.", "And as we said on our last conference call, that minimal expected growth in earnings for the year will be more like a high single-digit increase, if we excluded the estimated negative translation effect of the strong U.S. dollar and the cost from the incremental $30 million of pension expense.", "In conclusion, we believe that Tiffany is increasingly well-positioned as one of the world's most important luxury brands and has the potential to be more productive and profitable over the long-term.", "We have the growth opportunities, very sound strategies, a talent management -- talented management team and we\u2019re investing in important systems and capabilities, and have financial resources to pursue those strategies. We believe we\u2019ve had a decent start to the year all things considered and appreciate your interest in Tiffany.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Mark.", "Mark Aaron", "Thanks Ralph. We hope all of you now have a fuller understanding of our financial results and our plans. A replay of the call is available on our website or by dialing (888) 203-1112 in the U.S. or (719) 457-0820 outside the U.S. and entering passcode 3506887. Of course, you should feel free to call me with any questions. And note on your calendars that we expect to report second quarter results on August 27th before the market opens. Thanks for listening.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Q - ", " ", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines.

(NYSE:TIF) Q2 2015 Earnings Conference Call August 27, 2015  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Ralph Nicoletti - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Mark Aaron - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Analysts", "Operator", "Good day, everyone. And welcome to the Tiffany & Company Second Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today's call is Ralph Nicoletti, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark Aaron", "Thank you. Good day, everyone. We reported Tiffany's second quarter results earlier today. So hopefully you've read the news release. I am coming to you this morning from New York while that\u2019s evening in Shanghai where Ralph is joining us on this call. On today's call we will review the quarterly results and how they relate to our growth strategies and then comment on the outlook for the rest of the year.", "Before continuing please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.", "So from an overall perspective second quarter financial results from the top line to the bottom line continued to be significantly pressured by the strong U.S. dollar and worldwide net sales as reported were flat to last year. However, excluding the substantial negative translation effect from that strong dollar, second quarter worldwide sales rose 7% ranging from an increase of 27% in Japan, to 19% in Europe, to 9% in Asia-Pacific, to the Americas were sales were unchanged from the prior year. And lastly to other sales which declined 27% all of which I'll explain in a moment.", "The strong dollar has also had meaningful and diverging effects on foreign tourists spending by region. We added six new stores in the quarter and expanded our product assortment with new jewelry and watch designs. Gross margin was unchanged in the quarter and the SG&A expense ratio rose.", "We also recorded an impairment charge of approximately $10 million or $0.05 per diluted share for a portion of a loan we made to a diamond mining company. As a result net earnings declined 16% in the quarter, but excluding the impairment charge net earnings declined 10% on a non-GAAP basis which was inline with our expectation.", "Let's now look at sales performance by region in the second quarter. In the Americas on a constant exchange rate basis both total and comparable store sales were equal to last year, which compared with an 8% comp increase in last year's second quarter. And looking forward we are facing another tough comparison to an 11% comp increase in last year's third quarter.", "In this second quarter once again higher domestic spending in the Americas largely tied to strengthen statement jewelry sales was offset by lower foreign tourists spending in the U.S. especially in New York and Hawaii, which we attribute primarily to the effect from the strong U.S. dollar.", "But generally speaking our sales results in the Americas in the second quarter and first half apart from the strength at the highest statement jewelry price points have reflected varying degrees of softness across much of the U.S. Conversely comp store sales in Canada and Latin America have been strong.", "In dollars total sales in the Americas declined 2% as favorable price and mix was offset by lower jewelry unit volume largely tied to continued weakness at entry-level silver jewelry price points as well as the unit decline in fine jewelry. We opened one store in the Americas during the quarter in Rideau Centre in Ottawa replacing an older store that we had closed last year.", "And we are looking forward to opening Tiffany's first store in Chile in Santiago next month. Also we recently relocated one of our shops in Montr\u00e9al from Holt Renfrew to the nearby Ogilvy department store. We will soon be relocating our store in Denver's Cherry Creek Mall to an enhanced location within the mall. We are in the process of doing a similar relocation of our Century City store in L.A. and we are relocating a department store location in Mexico. All of which exemplify our strategy to optimize the quality of our distribution base.", "Moving to the Asia-Pacific region sales on a constant exchange rate basis rose 9% in total led by fashion gold jewelry and statement jewelry sales, while comp store sales increased 6% on top of the 7% increase in last year's second quarter. As we saw in the first quarter performance in the region was once again mixed and led by double-digit sales growth in China and Australia as well as varying degrees of growth in most other markets.", "However, our stores in Hong Kong and Macau continue to experience weakness that began in the second half of last year as we believe a number of Chinese tourists have shifted their traveling and shopping to other markets at least for the moment. In addition while our sales rose in Korea in the quarter we believe the rate of growth was constrained by foreign tourists who avoided traveling to Korea during the MERS outbreak.", "It is possible that an improvement in sales growth maybe gradual as foreign tourists bookings take some time to improve. With regard to recent news from China in the same way that it's not possible to quantify the positive wealth effect from a rising stock market on our sales growth there in the past couple of years. It\u2019s similarly difficult to predict any potential negative effect on sales in magnitude or duration from their recent stock market correction or currency devaluation.", "But most important Tiffany remains focused on the long-term growth opportunity to serve Chinese consumers both locally and globally and we have not in any way altered our strategies. When measured in U.S. dollars the total Asia-Pacific sales increased 4% due to favorable price and mix.", "We expanded Tiffany's presence by adding four new stores in the Asia-Pacific region during the second quarter including our first Company-operated store in Thailand in the Emporium Shopping Complex in Bangkok. Our 29th and 30th stores in China in Hangzhou and in Chengdu and our third store in Macau in the newly expanded Galaxy. We are planning five additional store openings across the region in the second half of the year as well as three closings all consistent with our global store strategy.", "Now let's look at Japan and its local currency sales performance. We think one can only really evaluate our results this year in Japan by reflecting on the dramatic sales volatility we experienced last year when comp store sales had increased 30% in yen in the first quarter due to a pull forward of customer demand and anticipation of the consumption tax increase on April 1 followed by a 13% comp decline in last year's second quarter.", "So we clearly had an easier comparison in this second quarter, but nonetheless we were very pleased with the 21% comp increase that we achieved in the second quarter and year-over-year comparisons in Japan are frankly also relatively easy for the balance of the year. The 27% total sales growth in the yen in the quarter was due in similar degrees to both unit volume increases across all jewelry categories as well as favorable price and mix.", "In addition, while our sales in Japan are largely made to Japanese customers the year-over-year sales growth has been due to increase sales to foreign tourists particularly Chinese visitors which are perhaps tied to some degree to the attractiveness arising from the weaker yen. And due to the substantially weaker yen versus last year that 27% total sales growth in yen in the second quarter was reduced to 5% when translated into U.S. dollars.", "To repeat something we said on our last call, we believe the weaker yen has affected spending by Japanese tourists when they travel, but conversely might be generating local sales demand in Japan. The store count in Japan was unchanged at 56 Company-operated locations, but we are enhancing our store base by relocating two department store base locations this year. In terms of our business in Europe we were certainly pleased with the continuation of very strong local currency sales growth in the second quarter.", "On a constant exchange rate basis both total and comparable store sales rose 19% compared with an 8% comp decline in last year's second quarter when we were seeing broad-based softness across Europe at that time. However, sales growth in this second quarter was geographically broad-based across continental Europe and in the UK reflecting strong sales growth to foreign tourists as well as to a lesser extent an increase to local customers.", "Engagement jewelry was the strongest category in Europe in the quarter. To perhaps state the obvious the euro and pound have weakened against the dollar in the past year. This has attracted foreign tourists to shop in Europe while potentially discouraging some Europeans from shopping abroad and instead encouraging them to spend locally. Our performance in Europe reflects both phenomena. When translated into U.S. dollars total second quarter sales in Europe increased 2% due to favorable price and mix.", "During the second quarter we opened 550 square meter two-level store on the fashionable Rue du Rh\u00f4ne in Geneva. We also recently relocated our store within Selfridges in London to a more prominent location within that store and are relocating our store within Harrods to a new location within that store. We now operate 39 stores in Europe and believe there are considerable long-term opportunities to further develop our company operated European store base.", "Rounding out the segment review are other sales which represented only 2% of worldwide sales in the quarter and includes retail store sales in the United Arab Emirates and Russia as well as wholesale diamond sales and some third-party licensing revenue. Other sales on a constant exchange rate basis declined 27% total in the second quarter largely due to lower wholesale sales of diamonds.", "On the other hand comp store sales were up 8%. Earlier this year we were pleased to relocate our store in the Mall of the Emirates in Dubai taking advantage of the opportunity to update to our current store design and to expand the size of the store. We mentioned in the regional commentaries that store openings are complemented by store renovations, relocations and several closings this year.", "Totaling up this activity both completed and planned we are on track to increase our Company-operated worldwide store base by a net of 12 stores this year representing a 4% net increase in both our Company-operated store base and in worldwide square footage.", "At the same time our strategy is to enhance our website with compelling content that builds brand and product awareness and drive store traffic. All of these initiatives support our broader global strategy to more effectively engage customers and enhance their experience and relationship with Tiffany.", "In terms of a few merchandising highlights as measured in dollars the strongest performer in the quarter was the fashion jewelry category with a continued shift toward gold jewelry. Our statement, fine and solitaire category was mixed with substantial growth and high-end statement jewelry but some softness in fine jewelry. And there was a bit of softness in the engagement jewelry category as well.", "Product innovation is an important strategy at Tiffany, which consists of introducing entirely new design collections but also periodically expanding refreshing and reinterpreting existing collections. An excellent example of newness and a strong contributor to growth in fashion jewelry sales is the Tiffany T collection that we launched about a year ago.", "The collection continues to successfully attract style seeking customers as well as those purchasing gifts and is one of the reasons we've seen strength in gold jewelry sales. Another successful collection worth mentioning is our diamond focused Soleste collection which spans engagement and fine jewelry. When we speak about expanding existing collections with new designs one example is our popular Return to Tiffany collection with a particular focus on pieces and silver.", "In addition our fall ad campaign will also feature new interpretations of other iconic jewelry collections including Victoria and Tiffany Bow in fine jewelry and the Infinity fashion jewelry collection in gold and silver. So there will be a wide range of newness in our assortment this fall with freshness intended to improve overall sales growth and to also reinvigorate the silver jewelry category.", "Lastly, we recently completed the months long global rollout of CT60 collection of watches as previously discussed we are supporting the watch category with extensive marketing to strengthen product awareness and brand credibility and heritage. And we\u2019re pleased with initial reactions from customers and the media.", "So that covers the sales highlights. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Ralph.", "Ralph Nicoletti", "Thank you, Mark and hello everyone. I'm in China this week visiting many of our locations to stay close to the numerous growth opportunities for us to pursue here. Now I will get right into our second quarter results in a few key takeaways. The strong U.S. dollar continued to be a significant headwind on the translation of our results transacted outside the United States having a 7% negative effect on worldwide sales.", "It also continued to have a significant negative effect on tourist spending in the U.S. a decline in the operating margin reflected a lack of SG&A expense leverage, higher marketing spending and an impairment charge tied to a loan to a diamond mining company.", "Net earnings declined 16% as reported, but excluding the impairment charge net earnings declined 10% on a non-GAAP basis, which was a smaller rate of decline than in the first quarter and in line with our expectation. But in light of the strong U.S. dollar and macro uncertainties we modestly tempered our full-year expectations for net earnings and to be sure it's not overlooked we are pleased with inventory performance and cash flow year-to-date.", "Let\u2019s briefly review the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin of 59.9% in the second quarter was unchanged from the prior year due to the favorable effects of product input costs and lower wholesale sales of diamonds, which typically earn minimal if any margin, but also the negative effect from shifts in product mix especially contrasting the relatively low gross margins of high price point statement jewelry sales, which were strong with relatively high gross margins of silver jewelry sales, which were weak.", "In addition previous price increases taken have been offset by the unfavorable effect of the strengthening U.S. dollar. We are now in the process of further raising prices in regions that have experienced the most dramatic weakness in their currencies versus the dollar, while also taking some modest increases in other regions. For the full-year we continue to expect a modest increase in gross margin.", "On a related note, I should add that the more recent declines we\u2019ve seen in precious metals spot prices this year should eventually result in some benefit to gross margin, but it will take some time based on the rate of inventory turnover. Similarly you may have seen recent industry reports that softening global demand has resulted in a retreat in diamond costs albeit less pronounced for high-quality stones. While this has some favorable effect on our acquisition cost now again there is a long lead time before we will see any benefit in gross margin.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 9% in the quarter and would have increased 6% excluding a roughly $10 million impairment charge for a portion of a loan to a diamond mining company. In both of those year-over-year comparisons SG&A growth was reduced by 5% due to the translation effect of the strong dollar. Similar to the first quarter the SG&A increase reflected higher marketing spending as expected partially tied to a bridal campaign and the launch of our watch collection.", "We also recorded a portion of the $30 million of annual incremental U.S. pension and postretirement benefit costs. There were also increases in labor and store related occupancy costs as well, but we expect the SG&A expense ratio to increase in the full-year due to the lack of sales leverage we do expect some improvement in the ratio in the fourth quarter.", "In regard to the impairment charge for many years we have occasionally entered into financing arrangements with diamond mining companies as part of a strategy to secure high-quality diamond supply based on recent developments associated with the contractual terms of our agreement with the Koidu mine in Sierra Leone. We determined that it is probable that a portion of that loan will not be collectible in accordance with the contract terms. Therefore, we recorded the charge and as you could see in today's 10-Q filing the situation is still evolving.", "In total our forecast which excludes the impairment charge in any potential future similar charges now calls for operating earnings for the full-year to be modestly below last year. Interest and other expenses net in the quarter was below last year from our refinancing of long-term debt to lower rates in the third quarter of 2014. In addition, the year-over-year delta also included modest foreign currency transaction losses in the second quarter after we benefited from some gains in the first quarter. We continue to project interest and other expense net at approximately $50 million in 2015.", "The second quarter's effective tax rate was less than last year\u2019s second quarter as we expected. Last year's rate was somewhat inflated by changes in tax legislation while this year's rate benefited from a reduction in a tax valuation allowance. We continue to forecast an effective tax rate in 2015 similar to last year's rate of 34.4%.", "Tiffany's balance sheet remains strong at the end of the quarter. Total cash and short-term investments were $771 million at January 31. Short-term and long-term debt totaled just over $1 billion representing 37% of stockholders equity. As we have stated in the past our financial strategy is to maintain more than adequate resources to support the growth of our business regardless of short-term economic cyclicality.", "At the same time we also regularly consider appropriate opportunities to return excess cash to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases. As examples, we recently increased our quarterly dividend by 5% which represented the 14 dividend increase in the past 13 years and we spent approximately $56 million in the first half of the year to repurchase our shares at an average cost of $88 per share.", "At July 31 we had approximately $217 million available for repurchases under the current authorization that runs through March of 2017. Our strategy for inventories is to always maintain deep assortments and high availability in our stores, but our goal for this year and beyond is to also keep inventory growth below the rate of sales growth by achieving better productivity in our stores as well as in our overall supply chain.", "At July 31 net inventories were 7% lower than a year ago. When excluding the effect of translation of the strong U.S. dollar, inventory still declined by 2% compared with the first half 4% increase in worldwide sales on a constant exchange basis.", "Capital expenditures of $98 million in the first half were up slightly from $91 million a year ago. Our forecast continues to call for spending about $260 million this year with an emphasis on stores and also new IT systems being implemented over several years such as for global customer relationship management and inventory management.", "Lastly, we think it's prudent to revise modestly downward our full-year net earnings forecast in light of the dollar being even stronger than we initially anticipated as well as ongoing external volatilities. We had previously forecast minimum earnings growth on top of the $4.20 per share excluding a debt extinguishment charge last year. Now we are forecasting net earnings 2% to 5% below last year when excluding the loan impairment charge taken in the second quarter and any further similar charges that could potentially be recorded later in the year.", "In addition, this assumes no net earnings growth in the third quarter versus EPS of $0.76 per share in last year's third quarter which excluded the debt extinguishment charge and then we expect the resumption of earnings growth in the fourth quarter. In conclusion we met our overall expectations in the first half of the year despite the significant adverse effects from the strong dollar.", "Looking forward we are pursuing numerous initiatives tied to further expanding and enhancing our global store base, product development and effective marketing communications in order to strengthen Tiffany's relationship with its customers. So we intend to stay focused on global growth opportunities ahead of us.", "I will now turn the call back to Mark.", "Mark Aaron", "Thanks Ralph for dialing in from Shanghai. We hope all of you on the call now have a better understanding of the second quarter results and our strategies. A replay of the call is available on our website or by dialing 888-203-1112 in the U.S. or 719-457-0820 outside the U.S. and entering passcode 2738523.

The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.", "Okay, in general the third quarter results were mixed. Sales and margins continued to be negatively affected by the strong U.S. dollar and net earnings came in several cents lower than we expected. However, worldwide net sales increased 4% on a constant exchange rate basis despite greater than expected softness in the Americas, reflecting strong growth in Japan and modest growth in Europe and the Asia Pacific regions.", "Worldwide net sales declined 2% when reported in dollars on a GAAP basis. In addition to the strong dollars effect on translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars, we continued to experience a negative effect on foreign tourists spending in the U.S. that was only partly offset by higher foreign tourist spending in other regions.", "In addition, we took a price increase in the quarter which moved us closer to restoring our global pricing structure to normal levels given the dollar\u2019s continued strength. Gross margin rose in the quarter and SG&A expense growth was modest. Adding it all up EPS of $0.70 was down 8% from non-GAAP EPS of $0.76 last year which had excluded a charge for debt extinguishment.", "In other highlights we introduced new designs in several existing jewelry collections in a range of materials and price points. We also made good progress with our long term strategy to optimize our store base with openings, renovations, relocations and closings and in light of recent stock price weakness purchases under our stock repurchase plan were increased allowing us to use our strong cash position to return value to shareholders.", "So let\u2019s now look at regional sales performance. In the Americas on a constant exchange rate basis, total sales declined 5% and comparable store sales were down 6% on top of 11% comp increase in last year\u2019s third quarter. In the quarter we once again saw a substantial decline in sales to foreign tourists in varying degrees by nationality with pronounced weakness in New York area as well as in other tourist related markets on the East and West coast of the U.S. and in Hawaii.", "Sales to domestic customers were roughly flat from last year, which we can partly attribute to difficult year-over-year comparisons, but also perhaps to continued softness in broader consumer spending trends. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that we are in the process of some major U.S. store renovations having just completed a magnificent upgrade of our important store on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, and now focused on major renovations of our stores on Union Square and San Francisco and on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills.", "In contrast to the disappointing sales results in the U.S. we continued to generate solid comp store sales growth in Canada and Latin America in the quarter. We entered the new market of Chile when we opened the store in Santiago in September, and just earlier this month we relocated our Mexico City store within the El Palacio de Hierro Polanco, which is the largest luxury department store in Latin America.", "In dollars, total sales in the Americas declined 7%. Despite strong sales of statement jewelry there were varying degrees of softness across most other jewelry categories in stark contrast to last year\u2019s strong third quarter.", "Let\u2019s now turn to results of the Asia Pacific region where on a constant exchange rates basis sales increased 6% in total, and comp store sales rose 2% in contrast to a 3% comp decline in last year\u2019s third quarter. Overall, results in the third quarter reflected healthy sales growth in China and Australia, mixed results in other countries and continued pronounced weakness in Macau and Hong Kong.", "During the quarter, we expanded our store base in Asia Pacific by opening our fourth store in Macau in the Studio City Hotel and Resort. Earlier this month, we opened two stores, one in China in Beijing SKP which was formerly known as the Shin Kong place which is a major shopping center in China and the other in Korea in the newly built Pangyo Hyundai Department Store.", "With China in the news so much regarding their economy stock market and currency, we are pleased and encouraged that our total sales in China increased by a healthy amount in the third quarter despite volatility and sensitivity to headline macro events. It\u2019s also important to note that we continued to benefit from spending by Chinese tourists as they travel to other regions. So to reiterate what we had consistently said, Tiffany remains focused on the long term growth opportunity to serve Chinese consumers, both locally and globally and we have not in any way altered our strategies.", "When measured in U.S. dollars, total Asia Pacific sales declined 2% in the quarter primarily reflecting the negative effect of currency translation. ", "Japan in the third quarter once again posted strong sales growth in yen. Total sales rose 34% in yen driven by unit growth and increases in average price across all jewelry categories. A 24% comp increase in yen was on top of the 6% comp declines in last year\u2019s third quarter.", "The vast majority of purchases in Japan are made by local customers and overall growth in the quarter was partly driven by higher local customer spending. Also contributing to the sales growth were higher sales to foreign tourists\u2019 particularly Chinese visitors as I alluded to a moment ago, which maybe related to the attractiveness arising from the weaker yen as well as the Chinese shifting some of their travel this year away from Hong Kong and Macau atleast for the moment.", "And I should add that a portion of Japan\u2019s non-comp sales growth in the quarter was due to the timing of some wholesale sales. The yen remains substantially weaker than the dollar but that 34% total sales growth in the quarter in local currency was still a solid 17% when translated into U.S. dollars. The store count in Japan was unchanged at 56 company operated locations but we are enhancing our store base by relocating two department store base locations this year.", "Europe also continued to perform well in the quarter. On a constant exchange rate basis due to a combination of higher sales to foreign tourists and to local customers that was geographically broad based across Continental Europe and in the U.K.", "On a constant exchange rate basis total sales increased 9% and comparable store sales rose 6% on top of the 2% comp increase in last year\u2019s third quarter. Engagement jewelry was the strongest category in Europe in the quarter, but most other categories were up as well in local currencies.", "And during the quarter as part of our focus on optimizing the existing store base, we relocated and transitioned our one store within Harrods in London to become two separate boutiques, one within their fine jewelry hall and the other within their luxury jewelry hall.", "Earlier this year we had also relocated our store within Selfridges to gain a stronger and expanded presence. And just earlier this month we were pleased to open our 40th store in Europe representing our third store in Spain and second in Madrid in the El Corte Ingl\u00e9s department store.", "As we\u2019ve said throughout this year, both the euro and pounds weakness against the dollar have stimulated foreign tourist spending in Europe while perhaps also encouraging some Europeans to shop locally rather than abroad. However, when translated into U.S. dollars, total third quarter sales in Europe decreased 2% due to small variations among jewelry categories in unit volume and average price.", "Lastly, other sales rose 8% in the quarter on a constant exchange rate basis with comp store sales down 3%. This smallest of our segments includes comparable store sales in our one store in Russia which has been a strong performer since opening last year and our five stores in the United Arab Emirates. It also includes wholesale diamond sales which rose in the quarter as well as some third-party licensing revenue.", "One element of our long-term strategy is to proactively engage customers in our stores through more consultative selling. As I'd mentioned, paralleling that is our strategy to optimize our store base through a combination of store openings, renovations, relocations and closings.", "We are on-track to increase our company-operated worldwide store base by a net of 12 stores this year representing a 4% net increase in both our company-operated store base and in worldwide square footage.", "The longer-term expectation is to increase worldwide square footage closer to 2% a year. And of course, we compliment our store presence with regular enhancements to our website in order to reinforce brand and product awareness.", "We're also pleased to see an increase in worldwide e-commerce sales on a constant exchange rate basis in the quarter. All of these initiatives in stores and online support our global strategy to further enhance customers relationship and experiences with Tiffany.", "In terms of a few merchandizing highlights as measured in dollars, category trends were pretty similar to recent quarters. While there was some continued softness in the fine jewelry part of our statement, fine and solitaire category we again experienced considerable growth in high-end statement jewelry through our VIP customer events. The engagement jewelry category performed well in Japan and Europe, but continued to post soft results on a worldwide basis. The fashion jewelry category continued to have strong growth in gold jewelry reflecting the success of the Tiffany T collection, although it\u2019s worth noting that the year-over-year comparison was negatively effected by strong launch sales in last year's third quarter.", "While our strategy for product innovation include the periodic introduction of entirely new design collection such as Tiffany T we are equally focused on expanding refreshing and reinterpreting existing collections in the interim years.", "For example, in order to improve our performance in silver jewelry sales at price points below $500, we recently introduced new designs in our popular Return to Tiffany collection with more to come next year.", "We've seen good initial results, but think we'll be better able to evaluate our success in the silver jewelry category after the holiday season. In other initiatives Tiffany's Infinity jewelry collection which incorporates the design, symbolic of continuous connection, energy and vitality has been expanded in both silver and gold.", "At higher price points we've expanded the beautiful Victoria collection with new designs in platinum and diamonds and the elegant Tiffany Bow collection with designs in gold and diamonds.", "All these collections are being supported with broad print and digital advertising and we've been pleased with initial customer reaction. Lastly, we continue to be pleased with initial sales of our new CT60 and East West collection of watches that were launched earlier this year. And we've just added some stunning new jewelry watches to the assortment.", "As we previously said, we are supporting the watch category with extensive marketing to strengthen awareness of not only the product, but also our brand credibility and heritage. So that's covers a sales highlight showing the wide range of performance and progress by region and product category.", "I'm now please to turn the call over to Ralph.", "Ralph Nicoletti", "Thank you, Mark, for that overview. Before I review the rest of the results, I'd like to summarize some of the highlights regarding the third quarter. Once again the strong U.S. dollar continued to negatively effect the translation of our results transacted outside the U.S. with a 6% negative effect on worldwide sales and it adversely affected tourist spending in the U.S.", "The operating margin, while benefiting from a high gross margin continues to experience a lack of SG&A expense leverage. Earnings per share were down 8% from last year's adjusted EPS and were below our expectation that called for no earnings growth in the quarter.", "We lowered our full year expectation for net earnings, although we significantly increased our free cash flow projection based on effective inventory management. Lastly, in light of recent stock price weakness purchases made under our stock repurchase program were increased using our strong cash position to return value to shareholders.", "Now let's look at the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin of 60.2% in the third quarter was 70 basis points higher than last year, partly reflecting the favorable effect of product input costs, but also some negative effect from shifts in product mix especially contrasting the relatively low gross margins of high price point statement jewelry sales, which were strong with relatively high gross margins of silver jewelry sales, which were weak.", "An increase in the wholesale sales of diamonds also had some negative effect on gross margins. In addition, we took some price increases of varying degrees in all regions during the third quarter, partly necessitated by the strong U.S. dollar moving us closer but not completely to restoring our worldwide pricing structure to normal levels.", "For the full year we continue to expect a modest increase in gross margins. And as we mentioned three months ago on our last call, gross margins should also benefit further from this year's declining precious metal and diamond cost, but that benefit will take some time to be reflected in gross margins based on the rate of inventory turnover.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses rose only 1% in the quarter, benefiting from the translation effect of a strong dollar and lower variable labor cost that largely offset investments in stores and higher pension costs. SG&A expense growth was reduced by 5% due to the translation effect of the strong dollar.", "In addition as previously communicated, we had expected that year-over-year growth in marketing would moderate due to heavy spending in last year's second half and that's what happened.", "Interest and other expenses net in the quarter came in about equal to last year. Interest expense itself continued to be lower than the prior year due to our refinancing of long-term debt to lower rates in October of 2014.", "However, we also recorded some foreign currency transaction losses in third quarter. We continue to project interest in other expenses net at approximately $50 million in 2015. The third quarter's effective tax rate of 35.5% was in line with last year's third quarter and we continue to forecast the full year effective tax rate in 2015 similar to last year's rate of 34.4%.", "In terms of our balance sheet, we finished the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $725 million, while short-term and long-term debt of just over $1 billion represented 38% of stockholder's equity.", "An important part of our financial strategy is to maintain adequate liquidity to invest in growing our business regardless of short term economic cyclicality. At the same time, we also regularly consider appropriate opportunities to return cash to shareholders in dividend growth and share repurchases.", "During the second quarter, we had increased our quarterly dividend by 5%, which represented the 14th dividend increased in the past 13 years. During the quarter in light of share price weakness purchases under our stock repurchase program accelerated as we spend approximately $60 million to repurchase our shares at an average cost of $80 per share.", "We expect $116 million for share repurchases in this year to-date. And at October 31st we had approximately $157 million available for repurchases under our current authorization that run through March of 2017.", "Another one of our financial goals is to keep inventory growth below the rate of sales growth by achieving better productivity in our stores, as well as in our overall supply chain, while also maintaining deep assortments and high availability in our stores.", "I'm pleased that our October 31, net inventories were 8% below last year, excluding the translation effect of the strong U.S. dollar, inventory still decline by 4% compared with the 4% year to-date increased in worldwide sales on a constant exchange rate basis.", "Rounding out our cash flow, capital expenditures were $159 million in the year to-date versus $153 million a year ago. We continue to forecast about $260 million for the full year with the focus on stores and new IT systems being implemented over several years including for global customer relationship management and inventory management.", "In terms of our financial forecast we believe this third quarter results combined with volatile external conditions and negative effects from strong U.S. dollar justify a downward adjustment to our earnings expectation.", "Our Company is well-positioned for the holiday season with a strong product offering and the holiday advertising campaign that touches on many categories. However, the macro environment in the near term remains uncertain in the Americas and elsewhere.", "Therefore, we now believe its prudent to forecast full year EPS, 5% to 10% lower than the $4.20 per share last year excluding charges for debt extinguishment last year and loan impairment in the second quarter of this year.", "However, from a cash flow perspective we are pleased with our progress and managing inventories more efficiently and we are significantly increasing our free cash flow objective by $100 million to now forecast in excess of $500 million for the full year.", "In summary, despite a number of challenges that have effected our financial results this year, we are progressing in a number of areas that are all intended to strengthen Tiffany's positioning among the world's most important luxury brand, while also enhancing profitability and productivity.", "I'll now turn the call back to Mark.", "Mark Aaron", "Thanks, Ralph. We hope our review of third quarter results has been helpful, and of course please call me with any questions.

(NYSE:TIF) Q1 2016 Earnings Conference Call May 25, 2016  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Mark Aaron - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Analysts", "Q - ", "Operator", "Good day, everyone and welcome to Tiffany & Company First Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn it over to Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relation. Mr. Aaron, you may begin.", "Mark Aaron", "Thank you, Kayla. Good day to everyone and greetings from sunny New York City. Tiffany reported its first quarter results earlier today and I hope you\u2019ve had a chance to review the news release. On today's call, I\u2019ll elaborate on the results as well as on management\u2019s outlook for the full-year.", "Before saying more please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts or forward-looking statement, actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.", "Okay, so now let\u2019s review the results. Overall, these first quarter results generally represented a continuation of the softness in sales trends that we experienced in the latter part of 2015 and were largely what we expected. Our earnings forecast that we first provided in March assume that we would begin the year with lower sales in most regions which combined with a higher gross margin and SG&A expense deleverage let us to anticipate a 15% to 20% decline in EPS in the first quarter and it essentially did.", "The actual 15% EPS decline which included a tax benefit and a 21% decline excluding the benefit were generally in line with our expectation. Most relevant however is that despite the persistence of well-known macroeconomic challenges we are continuing to pursue a number of important strategic initiatives designed to strengthen Tiffany\u2019s position as one of the world\u2019s most important luxury brand.", "So let\u2019s look at the quarter\u2019s results. Starting with the topline worldwide net sales declined 7% both as reported and on a constant exchange rate basis due to softness in most regions. There was no overall translation effect on sales as the recently strengthening yen offset any negative translational effect for this stronger U.S. dollar against other currencies.", "Looking at sales performance by region, in the Americas total sales declined 9% and comparable store sales declined 10%. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales declined 8% in the first quarter and comp store sales declined 9%. We attribute the overall lower sales to softness in domestic customer spending in many U.S. markets as well as lower spending by foreign tourists of many nationalities in New York and other high tourism markets.", "The total sales decline was due to unit related softness across most jewelry categories. Beyond the U.S. results were mixed in our stores in Latin America and Canada. We didn't add any stores to the Americas store base in the first quarter nor do we anticipate any growth in store locations in the Americas throughout the remainder of fiscal 2016.", "However, as part of our ongoing store optimization strategy, we are in the midst of significant renovations of our stores in San Francisco, Beverly Hills and Vancouver similar in scale to what we completed in Chicago last year.", "Moving to the Asia-Pacific region, total sales declined 8% and comp store sales declined 15% in the quarter. On a constant exchange rate basis however sales declined 5% in total and comp store sales were down 12% with softness across much of the region.", "We achieved total sales growth in China fueled by strong results in some significant newly opened stores which we believe may have affected comp store sales in the near-term for few existing stores. We also saw solid sales growth in Korea. However, that growth in China and Korea was more than offset by a continued significant decline in Hong Kong as well as more moderate declines in some other markets. We continue to assume that results in Hong Kong will be pressured throughout the year.", "As reported in U.S. dollars the total Asia-Pacific sales decline in the quarter was due to roughly equal declines in jewelry units and in changes in average price and product mix. Our Asia-Pacific store count was unchanged during the quarter although we do expect to add stores later in the year in China, Australia, Korea and New Zealand while also closing some older ones in a few countries.", "I am pleased to say that we had a good quarter in Japan. Total sales in Japan rose 8% and comparable store sales rose 12% in the quarter. On a constant exchange rate basis, which excludes the recent dramatic strengthening of the yen comp store sales rose 5%, which we attribute to increased spending by local customers, but that growth was mostly offset by lower wholesale sales resulting in a total sales increase of 1%.", "And looking at comp store sales growth on a constant exchange rate basis, it is also important to note that comp store sales have declined 24% in last year's first quarter after surging 30% in the first quarter of 2014 when consumers accelerated their purchasing prior to an increase in Japan's consumption tax.", "So we are really looking at a modestly positive three-year average annual run rate as we would expect for Japan. Total sales in Japan increased largely from higher jewelry unit volume. During the quarter, we closed the department store location in Yonago and plan to relocate a few stores in Japan over the course of this year.", "Tiffany's business in Europe remained under pressure in the first quarter particularly on the continent, which continued the trend we experienced late last year following the tragedy in Paris and also affected by the more recent tragedy in Brussels. Total sales in Europe declined 9% and comp store sales declined 15% in the quarter.", "On a constant exchange-rate basis total European sales declined 7% in the quarter and comp store sales declined 14%. Although you should remember that was on top of the very strong 18% comp increase in last year\u2019s first quarter.", "In addition to the difficult year-over-year comparison, we attributed the lower sales primarily to softness in foreign tourists spending across the continent. It's worth noting that our sales in the UK were relatively better than results on the continent and our business in Russia continued to perform very well.", "The total sales decline in Europe in the quarter was entirely due to lower jewelry unit volume. During the first quarter, we were pleased to add two stores in Italy. One on the fashionable Via Condotti marking our third store in Rome and a new store in beautiful Venice. There is additional store activity planned for later in the year in Europe.", "Lastly, other sales were 30% lower in the first quarter, primarily reflecting softness in our retail sales in the UAE as well as in the wholesale sales to other markets in the Middle East. In an effort to improve our performance around the world, we continue to be focused on further enhancing the consumer experience through in-store training and systems even more effectively engaged with our customers, optimizing our store base with renovations and relocation and of course introducing new designs across all product categories and price point.", "The objective is to increase the frequency of customer visit to our stores and the conversion rate. Complimenting Tiffany\u2019s company operated stores is our web presence around the world with e-commerce sales accounting for 6% of worldwide sales in 2015. I think it's worth noting that worldwide e-commerce sales rose slightly in the first quarter.", "We continue to believe that our dual focus on stores and online reinforces global brand and product awareness while enhancing customers overall experiences with Tiffany. And on a related note, we were pleased last month to launch Tiffany\u2019s relationship with NET-A-PORTER which we view as another step toward building greater awareness among a worldwide group of fashion conscious luxury shoppers.", "Touching on a few product category highlights in the quarter, while the 7% decline in worldwide sales is reflected in varying degrees of softness across all product categories. It is worth noting that both the engagement jewelry and wedding band category and the fashion jewelry category performed relatively better than the statement fine and solitaire jewelry category.", "Fashion jewelry sales continue to reflect the success of our Tiffany T and Atlas collection and while we've seen lower overall unit volume in fashion silver jewelry in certain regions. We are pleased with the initial reaction to new silver jewelry pieces that have been added to the return to Tiffany and Infinity collections to address softness that price points under $500.", "Our goals in fashion jewelry are to sustain growth in gold jewelry and stabilize sales in silver jewelry. And we plan to continue to pursue those objectives with new designs and advertising. We\u2019ve spoken about some softness in the engagement jewelry and wedding band\u2019s category in some regions over the past year and we are now focusing our marketing communications on more directly conveying the competitive strength of our engagement assortment.", "The ads not only celebrate the 130th anniversary of Tiffany introducing it's extraordinarily beautiful six-prong diamond rings setting in 1886, but they also emphasize the exceptional quality and rarity of our diamond. We believe that's a compelling message to couples who planned to marry.", "In the statement fine and solitaire jewelry category there are few key takeaways. At the highest end of our product offerings, we were pleased with the results that our annual Blue Book events that we held in New York in April. While the year-over-years sales comparison was quite difficult due to a record setting result at last year's event. Customers nonetheless showed their enthusiasm for the unique collection of statement jewelry that was focused on the theme the art of transformation.", "Rounding out that category, we saw continued success with our important and recently expanded Victoria collection, but this was offset by soft and mixed performance in other collections. Lastly, we continue to be pleased with our progress in building a larger and more significant watch business as we increase awareness of new design and Tiffany's heritage in that category.", "So that covers the sales review. Let's now take a look at the rest of the earnings result. Gross margin roses 2.1 point to 61.2% in the first quarter due to a continuation of favorable product input costs, price increases taken over the past year and sales mix, partly offset by the effect of currency translation and a lack of sales leverage on fixed costs coming from the sales decline.", "Our forecast continues to assume an increase in gross margin for the full-year, in fact more than we had initially expected. However, we continue to also expect the full-year increase to be more modest than we experienced in the first quarter as we anniversary some of the positive effect of favorable product input costs from last year as well as some of our pricing actions.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 3% in the quarter. The bulk of the modest increase was for labor occupancy and depreciation cost much of which was store related. We continue to expect deleveraging of SG&A expenses for the full-year. The effective tax rate declined to 29% in the quarter from 34.7% last year and the reduction reflected in unanticipated benefit related to the conclusion of a tax examination.", "For the full-year, our forecast continues to be based on an assume rate slightly lower then in 2015. As a result, EPS for the quarter of $0.69 was 15% lower than a year ago and as I mentioned earlier would have declined 21% excluding the tax benefit.", "Either way results were generally in line with our expectation that called for a 15% to 20% decline in the first quarter. We believe our balance sheet places us in a strong position to support our growth initiatives, while also providing flexibility and opportunities to return cash to shareholders and generate an attractive total shareholder return over the long-term.", "Cash and short-term investments totaled $790 million at April 30, compared with $715 million a year-ago. Short-term and long-term debt totaled $1.1 billion and as a percentage of stockholders equity was unchanged versus a year-ago at 37%. Net inventories at April 30, were 2% lower than a year-ago and the effective foreign currency translation was negligible.", "Accounts receivable of $221 million was 15% higher than a year-ago partly reflecting the timing of collections at quarter end as well as in-house credit related to both statement jewelry and wholesale sales. The receivable turnover rate remained high at 20 times per year.", "Capital expenditures were $46 million in the first quarter versus $37 million in last year's first quarter. Beyond reinvesting some of our free cash flow on our business, our objective is to provide opportunities to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.", "As a reminder, at the end of last year our Board terminated a previously existing $300 million repurchase program that had only about $59 million of authorization remaining and replaced it with a new authorization permitting the repurchase of up to $500 million of common stock.", "Under our stock repurchase plan in light of our share price, we maintained a healthy pace of repurchases in the first quarter spending $78 million to repurchase shares at an average cost of $66 per share. At April 30, approximately $416 million remained available for repurchases under the new program that expires in January 2019.", "So in terms of our outlook for the year we believe it is prudent at this point of the year to moderate our annual forecast and call for a mid single-digit decline in diluted EPS in 2016 versus last year's diluted EPS excluding charges.", "We do acknowledge some of the specific risks to the guidance for the remainder of the year primarily related to the difficulty in accessing the potential for a slower than expected improvement in U.S. activity, continued substantial softness in Europe and weakness in foreign tourist spending among the Chinese and other nationalities.", "Beyond this full-year forecast we are modifying our near-term expectation and now forecast diluted EPS in the second quarter to decline by a percentage similar to what we just experienced in the first quarter. For the full-year this assumes net worldwide sales declining by a low single-digit percentage. It also factors in a bit more upside to gross margin than we initially expected.", "I should add that our forecast also continues to assume a moderate strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the balance of the year and about a 2% net increase in worldwide gross square footage. Our full-year assumptions for inventories, CapEx and free cash flow are unchanged from the previous guidance. So that covers the outlook for this year.", "We're all well aware of the near-term external headwind. However, we believe that the initiatives we're currently pursuing combined with an assumption that these headwinds will begin to abate at some point will eventually set the stage for Tiffany to achieve its longer-term objectives that call for a high single-digit net earnings growth driven by mid single-digit worldwide net sales growth on a constant exchange rate basis and continued generation of strong free cash flow.", "We were pleased with the large attendance and interest that our recent Investor Day in New York and with the substantial webcast audience as well. As we emphasized in the management presentation, which are available on our Investor website, we are focused on generating an attractive total shareholder return in the long-term. As I noted before this focus revolves around our objective to strengthen Tiffany's position as one of the world's most important luxury brand.", "Strategically this is premised on initiatives to effectively communicate with and serve our customers to optimize our store base to delight customers with new product design and to improve our cost structure and enhance our supply chain. We believe we have a strong balance sheet and the right management team to execute on those strategies and on a related note we've begun the search to fill our recently vacated CFO position.", "So I hope you found today's conference call to be informative, but feel free to call me with any questions.

(NYSE:TIF) Q2 2016 Results Earnings Conference Call August 25, 2016  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Mark Aaron - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Analysts", "Operator", "Good day and welcome to this Tiffany & Company Second Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today's call is Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark Aaron", "Thanks, Alicia. Good day, everyone, and thanks for joining me for a review of Tiffany's second quarter financial results and the full year outlook that we reported earlier today. By now I hope you have had a chance to read the news release.", "Before proceeding, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the planned, assumed, or expected results expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors, risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the news release filed today under cover of Form 8-K. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, except as required by applicable law or regulation.", "Okay. Now let's look at the results. Taking an overall assessment of the second quarter, a modest increase in EPS on a GAAP basis and a modest decline on an adjusted basis that excludes the prior year charge were better than the expected decline that we had communicated three months ago.", "Worldwide sales were close to what we anticipated, declining 6% on both a GAAP basis and on a constant exchange rate basis, and generally continued to reflect the soft trends across regions that we've experienced for several quarters, which we attribute partly to domestic customer spending, but also to lower tourist spending, predominantly by Chinese tourists.", "However, we had a solid increase in gross margin and experienced less deleveraging of SG&A expenses than we had anticipated due to a slight SG&A expense decline, and our balance sheet remains strong.", "Looking forward, while the results for the quarter were a little better than we expected, we think it's prudent to maintain our existing outlook for the full year. A number of well known challenges and uncertainties that we've discussed over the past several quarters continue to persist.", "And while we believe we are managing costs efficiently and of course, continuing to pursue opportunities to more effectively reach customers with extraordinary products, marketing campaigns, and experiences, we think it is most appropriate to maintain a stance of near-term caution. Our long-term goal remains to strengthen Tiffany's position as one of the world's most important luxury brands.", "So looking at second quarter sales results in more detail, the 6% decline in worldwide sales reflected varying degrees of softness in all regions. There was no translation effect on total sales as the stronger yen offset the negative translation effects from the stronger US dollar against other currencies.", "In the Americas, both total sales and comparable-store sales declined 9%, which we attribute to generally soft demand in US customer spending, as well as lower spending in the US by Chinese and other tourists, especially in New York and in other high tourism markets.", "Beyond the US, results were mixed in our stores in Latin America and Canada. The overall sales declines in the second quarter in the Americas reflected unit-related softness across all jewelry categories and total sales and comps declined 8% and 9% on a constant exchange rate basis.", "We can only speculate on why domestic US consumer spending at the high end has been generally soft, but we believe that macro market and political uncertainties are likely playing a role in restrained consumer behavior.", "Regardless, our long-term plan is to mitigate these headwinds by better engaging with existing and potential customers and enhancing their experiences, both in our stores and online.", "We added one store in the Americas during the second quarter when we opened in the luxurious new Holt Renfrew store at the Square One Centre in Mississauga, which is the sixth largest city in Canada. Beyond opening new stores, our strategy to optimize our store base includes renovations, relocations and closings.", "Right now we are in the midst of major renovation of our stores in San Francisco, Beverly Hills, and Vancouver, similar to the renovation last year in Chicago of our Michigan Avenue store.", "In the Asia Pacific region, total sales and comparable-store sales declined 6% and 12% in the quarter. The sales declines were due to a combination of lower average price, lower unit volume, and a shift in mix and reflected softness across much of the region.", "We were pleased with healthy total and comparable store sales growth in China, as well as in Korea. However, continued meaningful sales declines in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau, and Singapore contributed to the overall regional softness.", "On a constant exchange rate basis, the total and comp store sales declines in the Asia Pacific region were 3% and 9%. During the quarter, we expanded our successful presence in Australia when we opened two stores, one at the Pacific Fair Center on the Gold Coast and one at the Sydney International Airport, and we now operate nine stores in Australia.", "In Japan, total sales and comparable store sales increased 10% and 13% in the quarter, but that increase entirely reflected the translation benefit from the recent and substantial strengthening of the yen against the dollar.", "This translation benefit more than offset lower spending that we estimate comes from foreign tourists, especially from China. There was also a decline in wholesale sales. An increase in average price was currency related, but we did have a modest increase in jewelry unit volume as well.", "On a constant exchange rate basis, however, total and comp store sales declined 5% and 3%, reflecting the lower tourist spending I just mentioned, as well as the decline in wholesale sales.", "We've noted that, based on our estimates, spending by local customers held up reasonably well in the quarter despite Japan's weak economy. The store count in Japan remained at 55 locations at the end of the quarter, although we are pursuing a number of renovations and three store relocations this year.", "In Europe, soft demand on the continent continued the weak trend that began in last year's fourth quarter with the tragedy in Paris. Total sales and comparable-store sales in Europe declined 12% and 17% in the quarter.", "The sales declines were due to lower jewelry unit volumes and we believe the sales declines reflected softness in foreign tourist spending across the continent, with a smaller decline in local spending by Europeans.", "On a constant exchange rate basis, total European sales dropped 8% and comp store sales declined 13%. On a positive note, we continued to see strong sales growth in Russia and it's also worth noting that we saw solid sales growth on a constant exchange rate basis in the UK in the quarter, although it was slightly down on a GAAP basis.", "There's obviously uncertainty and anxiety regarding the economic implications of Brexit, but, interestingly we saw an uptrend in the UK sales almost immediately following the vote. We believe that the weakening of the pound has made London a more attractive tourist shopping destination.", "During the second quarter, we opened a store in the de Bijenkorf luxury department store, representing our second store in Amsterdam, and we closed a small store in the Frankfurt airport.", "Lastly, other sales declined 3% in the quarter, reflecting continued weak retail demand in the five stores we operate in the UAE with comps down 22% and lower wholesale sales in other Middle East countries. However, those declines were mostly offset by an increase in wholesale sales of diamonds.", "Our multidimensional initiatives to improve sales performance revolve around a few core elements, enhancing the customer experience through in-store training and systems to more effectively engage with our customers, optimizing our store base with renovations, relocations, and select closings, introducing new designs across product categories and price points, and effective messaging through marketing campaigns to communicate Tiffany's relevancy to a wide audience. The overall objective of these efforts is to increase the frequency of customer visits to our stores and the conversion rate.", "With respect to our store base, in total we opened four stores during the quarter and closed one. For the full year we expect to add 11 stores, close nine, and relocate six, which will represent about a 2% net increase in gross retail square footage, and we expect to maintain that low single-digit growth rate in the foreseeable future.", "Beyond our stores is a strong web presence around the world, with e-commerce sales in 13 countries accounting for 6% of worldwide sales in 2015. Worldwide e-commerce sales in the second quarter were roughly unchanged from the prior year, but we also believe that our online presence enhances brand and product awareness and can drive store traffic, too.", "From a merchandising perspective in the quarter, performance among the product categories was pretty consistent with the first quarter. All categories were below prior year to one degree or another, but once again the fashion jewelry category and the engagement jewelry and wedding bands category performed relatively better than the statement, fine, and solitaire jewelry category.", "Within that category, statement jewelry, representing the highest price points has been the weakest performer in 2016 after posting very impressive growth last year.", "We're encouraged with steady progress toward improving sales in the fashion jewelry category as we have seen a moderation in year-over-year sales declines. Our plan is to grow gold jewelry sales and to stabilize sales in silver jewelry.", "Through recent innovations with more to come and with support from new advertising campaigns, we believe we are well positioned to provide a compelling message to consumers across a wide age range and by doing so, improve our performance in this category.", "One example of innovation in the fashion jewelry category is our new Return to Tiffany Love designs and the supporting #LoveNotLike, social digital marketing campaign. Also recently, Tiffany became the first luxury brand to sponsor a Snapchat lens on July 28 that was instrumental to the campaign. The Snapchat lens received millions of user plays and substantial media coverage.", "Additional new silver designs are intended to address softness at price points under $500. In fact, we've increased the number of silver jewelry SKUs under $500 by a double-digit percentage versus a year ago. At higher price points we focused on new designs in our important Tiffany T and Atlas Collections.", "The engagement jewelry and wedding band category also posted a relatively modest sales decline this quarter relative to last year. We believe we're increasing awareness of Tiffany's competitive strength in this category via a bold new advertising campaign this year that accentuates the rarity of our diamonds, as well as our craftsmanship and heritage.", "While Tiffany is certainly renowned for its classic six-prong setting, our Harmony diamond ring collection is generating strong results, as is our extraordinary assortment of wedding bands.", "Lastly, in the statement, fine, and solitaire jewelry category, the softness in statement jewelry has overshadowed more mixed results in other parts of that category. We are pleased with continued success in our recently expanded Victoria collection, but saw mixed performance in other collections. And later this year we plan to add new designs within our Keys collection among others.", "I should point out our new ad campaign, Legendary Style, which will be debuting in the coming days, highlighting a few of our important jewelry collections. Created in collaboration with fashion visionary Grace Coddington, this campaign features women of style and substance known for their unique points of view wearing iconic Tiffany designs. The campaign will appear in print, video, and across digital properties.", "Beyond jewelry, we're pleased with progress in building our watch business as we intend to introduce new designs in our CT60 and East West collections, add new jeweled watches, and increase customer appreciation of Tiffany's heritage in that category, which dates back to the 1800s.", "Also extending beyond jewelry, during the second quarter we were pleased to announce our collaboration with renowned designer Reed Krakoff to develop gift, home, and accessory collections for introduction in 2017.", "So that completes the sales review. Let's now take a look at the rest of the results. Gross margin rose 2 points to 61.9% in the quarter, which was higher than we expected largely due to sales mix.", "We continued to see margin improvement from a continuation of favorable product input costs and price increases taken over the past 12 months, as well as the shift in sales mix toward fashion jewelry in contrast with lower statement jewelry sales.", "We continue to assume some increase in gross margin for the full year, but at a rate in the second half considerably less than what we experienced in the first half. This is because we will anniversary the benefits from last year's pricing actions and also have a smaller benefit from favorable product input costs.", "Selling, general, and administrative expenses came in lower than we expected, declining 4% in the quarter. The decline was 2% when excluding the effect of a loan impairment charge last year. Measured either way, higher store related costs were more than offset by lower variable costs, as well as lower benefit and incentive compensation expenses.", "Marketing expense also declined, although a portion of the marketing variance was timing related and will occur later in the year, as we intend to maintain the marketing-to-sales ratio at a level roughly equal to the prior year.", "Even with the lower SG&A we experienced sales deleverage on SG&A expenses due to the sales decline, and despite the expected improving sales trends in the second half, we still expect some deleveraging for the full year.", "Putting it all together, the operating margin of 18.8% in the second quarter was slightly higher than last year, but the first half margin of 17% remained below last year. There is not much to say about the effective tax rate, which at 34.5% in the quarter was roughly in line with last year's rate. For the full year, our earnings outlook continues to be based on an assumed rate slightly lower than in 2015.", "As I said in my opening remarks, we're investing in a number of initiatives related to our store base, product assortment, marketing, and systems that are all intended to better engage and excite our customers and to grow sales.", "Having a strong balance sheet and generating healthy free cash flow enables us to continue to invest, but it also enables us to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend growth and generate an attractive total shareholder return over the long-term.", "Net inventories at the end of the quarter were 1% below a year ago. We intend to manage inventories with consideration of our sales performance, while at the same time maintaining high availability and deep assortments in our stores which we believe is a competitive advantage.", "Accounts receivable was 20% higher than a year ago, partly reflecting, as it did in the first quarter, the timing of third-party credit card collections when the quarter ends on a weekend.", "In addition, there was increased use of in-house credit related to higher priced jewelry sales and a small increase related to timing of sales in our wholesale business. The rate of receivable turnover was a high 20 times per year.", "Capital expenditures were $101 million in the first half of the year versus $98 million in last year's first half and the vast majority of CapEx is related to stores and IT spending. We maintained an active pace of share repurchases in the quarter, spending $72 million to repurchase shares at an average cost of $63 per share.", "And we've spent $150 million for share repurchases in the first half of this year and at July 31 had $344 million available for repurchases under the program that expires in January 2019.", "Tying it all together, we have cash and short term investments of $720 million on the balance sheet at the end of the second quarter. Total short term and long-term debt of $1.1 billion, represented 37% of stockholders' equity.", "I just want to make a couple of comments about our outlook. I mentioned earlier that sales were close to what we had anticipated for the second quarter, gross margin was better and SG&A was somewhat lower than expected, partly due to a shift in marketing spending.", "However, in light of the many macro challenges that we believe are affecting consumer behavior, we believe it is prudent to not change our sales and earnings outlook for the full year.", "Therefore, we continue to expect net worldwide sales declining by a low single digit percentage for the full year and EPS declining by a mid single digit percentage from last year's adjusted EPS, which had excluded loan impairment and certain staffing and occupancy charges.", "In terms of currency translation, we are now assuming that the dollar is unchanged from current spot rates for the balance of the year and we are continuing to expect operating cash flow of at least $660 million for the year and free cash flow of at least $400 million, based on these and other assumptions and plans.", "Of course, there are risks in any outlook and in a volatile environment it's even more challenging to predict the timing of a sustainable improvement in US activity or when a turnaround will occur in Europe or the patterns of travel and tourist spending by Chinese and other nationalities.", "However, we believe we can expect improving trends in sales and earnings in the second half of the year as we continue to execute on the plethora of initiatives we are pursuing and also benefit from what we consider to be easier year-over-year comparisons.", "In summary, we intend to remain focused on key strategic pillars that call for effectively communicating with and serving our customers, optimizing our store base, delighting customers with new product designs, and improving our cost structure and enhancing our supply chain. We believe our brand and management team are well suited to achieve those objectives.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "End of Q&A", "That wraps up my remarks, which I hope you have found informative. Please call me with any questions.", "A replay of this call is available on our website or by dialing 888-203-1112 in the US or 719-457-0820 outside the US and entering passcode 2533894. Finally, please note on your calendars that we expect to report third quarter results on Wednesday, November 29.

(NYSE:TIF) Q3 2016 Earnings Conference Call November 29, 2016  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Mark Erceg - Executive Vice President and CFO", "Mark Aaron - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Analysts", "Operator", "Please standby, we are about to begin. Good day, everyone. Welcome to this Tiffany & Company Third Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today's call is Mr. Mark Erceg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "At this time, I\u2019ll turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead.", "Mark Aaron", "Thank you. Good day, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. Joining me for today\u2019s call is Tiffany's new Chief Financial Officer, Mark Erceg.", "Before proceeding, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the planned, assumed, or expected results expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements.", "Additional information concerning factors, risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the news release filed today under cover of Form 8-K. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, except as required by applicable law or regulation.", "Okay. By now you should have had a chance to read the news release which we issued earlier today, which indicated worldwide sales increased 1%, net earnings were up 5% and net earnings per diluted share were up 9% during the third quarter versus a year ago.", "So in order to make the most efficient use of today\u2019s call, I will provide some additional perspective on segment sales and product trends, after which Mark will take us through the rest of the P&L and comment on Tiffany's outlook for the remainder of the year, and as always you can refer to the report on Form 10-Q we filed earlier today for additional details.", "Starting in the Americas, total sales were 2% below prior year at a modest decline in jewelry units was mostly offset by an increase in the average price per unit sold. Comparable store sales improved to a 2% decline with no effect from currency translation after a 10% decline in the first half. While this is encouraging we did have an easier comparison to last year.", "Sales in the U.S. were again pressured by lower spending attributable to local customers, which we believe was tied to macro, market and political uncertainties. Interestingly, spending by customers that we identify as foreign tourist actually rose in the quarter in contrast to a decline in the first half, as continued lower spending attributed to Chinese tourists was more than offset by increased spending attributed to visitors from Japan and elsewhere.", "I presume you saw the comment in today\u2019s news release regarding our Fifth Avenue Flagship Store in New York. Sales in that store in every quarter of last year represented less than 10% of worldwide sales and had been a similar level so far this year in the third quarter and year-to-date through October 31st.", "There certainly has been a lot of attention focused on the potential effect of activities related to the recent U.S. Presidential Election on stores along the relevant part of Fifth Avenue. What we've seen has been some adverse effect on traffic in our Flagship store, as well as the continuation of sales softness relative to last year and to our other U.S. stores this year. Because of obvious uncertainty, we will maintain a cautious outlook in the near-term and we cannot provide any assurance that sales in these both in the fourth quarter and beyond will not be negatively affected.", "During the quarter we relocated one of our Canadian stores located within the Holt Renfrew department store in Vancouver and also relocated one of our U.S. stores located within the King of Prussia Mall, which is in the Philadelphia market.", "In the Asia-Pacific region we were pleased to return to sales growth in the third quarter, with total sales up 4% as reported and 3% on a constant exchange rate basis. There was an increase in jewelry units and a decline in the average price per unit sold. Comp store sales declined 7%. Currency translation had no year-over-year effect on comps in the quarter.", "The growth in the region partly reflected the continuation of solid total and comp store sales growth in Mainland China. We were also pleased to experience a smaller sequential sales decline in Hong Kong and elsewhere in the region sales were strong in both our retail and wholesale business in Korea, but remained especially soft in Australia and Singapore.", "The Asia-Pacific region had a lot of store activity in the quarter, where we opened four stores and closed two. In China, we opened the store in Ningbo-Heyi and one in Tianjin incense, also in China we closed a very small store in Beijing in the Peninsula Hotel and we closed one in the Tianjin Friendship Store. We also opened our 15th store in Korea in the Shinsegae Gangnam Department Store and we opened our first store in New Zealand in Auckland\u2019s magnificent Britomart precinct.", "Sales in Japan in the quarter were mixed. Total sales rose 13% and comp store sales rose 20%, but that entirely resulted from the favorable translation effect of the stronger yen versus the dollar. However, translation aside, there was a solid increase in jewelry unit sold.", "On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales declined 4% in the quarter and comps rose 2%. I should point out that the disparity between the total sales declined and the comp sales increase, reflected lower wholesale sales in Japan.", "The strengthening of the yen this year has made purchasing by foreigners more expensive in Japan, which we believe is negatively affecting our business as a result of the reduced tourist spending.", "In addition, while the modest comp increase in yen that I noted earlier was a sharp contrast to the substantial local currency sales increase in last year\u2019s third quarter, when spending attributed to domestic customers and Chinese tourists, likely tied to the weekend at that time was exceptionally strong, the two-year run rate is still quite positive.", "It\u2019s also worth noting that in addition to higher local spending attributed to Japanese customers in this latest quarter, we are seeing, as I mentioned earlier, a solid increase in spending attributable to Japanese tourists in other regions.", "In Europe, total sales declined 10% due to a combination of lower jewelry units sold and the lower average price per units sold, and comp store sales declined 14%. On a constant exchange rate basis, comp store sales were down 7%, which compared with a healthy increase in last year\u2019s third quarter.", "Demand across Continental Europe remained soft, although, varying degrees and has been especially soft in Paris since the tragic events of last year. Economic conditions also likely contributed to weak spending by domestic customers in many countries.", "On the other hand, the bright spot for us in Europe was the U.K., where we attribute sales growth of spending by foreign tourists reacting favorably to the weakening of the pound after the Brexit vote. It is worth noting that we recently took a single-digit price increase in the U.K. to partly offset the effect of the weaker pound.", "Lastly, sales in our other segment increased 18% in the quarter, but that entirely reflected an increase in wholesale sales of diamonds since comp store sales actually declined [technical difficulty] due to continued weak sales in our five stores in United Arab Emirates.", "In terms of product categories, funds in the quarter were similar to what we experienced in the first half of the year, with jewelry at lower price points outperforming pieces at higher price points.", "The best performing jewelry category was fashion jewelry, which posted a modest increase over last year. This was driven by an increase in gold jewelry sales tied to the strength of the T collection, which we have continued to build upon with new designs.", "In addition, fashion silver jewelry stabilized with sales up slightly from the prior year, although, that varied by region and was led by the popularity of the Return to Tiffany Love collection. We\u2019ve added quite a bit of product newness in silver jewelry this year, with a double-digit percentage increase in the number of new SKUs under $500.", "At the other extreme was continued softness across the statement, fine and solitaire jewelry category, led by decline in high-end statement sales, which in contrast had posted strong growth last year, performing roughly in line with the prior year on a worldwide basis was the engagement jewelry and wedding bands category, with results varying by region.", "Rounding up the product review is the watch category, which posted strong growth, albeit from a still small base, as we continue to be pleased with our customer\u2019s interest in new designs. Finally, worldwide e-commerce sales in the third quarter increased in line with overall sales growth.", "To summarize our topline results, we would say that third quarter results were mixed with some improvement in certain geographies and product categories, but with softness in other areas making it premature to say that there has been a meaningful turn in the business.", "I am now pleased to turn the call over to Mark Erceg.", "Mark Erceg", "Thanks, Mark. Welcome everyone. Before jumping straight into the P&L, let me take a minute to explain why I joined Tiffany. Simply put I joined Tiffany, because I believe we have tremendous opportunity to increase the profitability of our business and in so doing create attractive total shareholder returns in the years ahead.", "Consistent with this my three primary objectives will be helping Frederic and the rest of Tiffany\u2019s strong management team. But; first, identify profitable and sustainable growth opportunities; second, to invest behind those opportunities with funds generated from tight cost control efforts and the efficient deployment of capital; and third, to drive execution discipline in order to enable us to achieve that growth in the way that enhances shareholder value.", "Now let\u2019s quickly look at the rest of the income statement. Gross margin was up 80 basis points versus year ago at 61% as we continue to see some benefit from lower product input costs and a continued shift in product sales away from statement jewelry and towards fashion jewelry, which as you know carries a higher gross margin.", "SG&A rose 4% in the third quarter, after having declined 4% in the second quarter. The increase partly resulted from some marketing spending that was shifted from the second quarter into the second half of the year. The increase also reflected higher store occupancy and depreciation costs along with higher labor and incentive compensation costs.", "Interest and other expenses were lower than last year due to a combination that reduced foreign currency transaction losses and lower interest expense, and our effective tax rate came in at 34.6%.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we believe Tiffany\u2019s strong balance sheet is a competitive advantage in giving our cash balance, available liquidity and modest leverage we are well-positioned to support all of our key business initiatives going forward.", "That said, we will continue to explore ways to improve asset productivity, including through the proactive management of inventory both at the store level and throughout the entire supply chain in order to generate healthy levels of free cash flow. And speaking of free cash flow, inventory at quarter end was 2% lower than a year ago. Our long-term objective of keeping inventory growth below the rate of sales growth remains unchanged.", "Accounts receivable were 4% higher than at this time last year, with the increase being mostly currency related. Capital expenditures were $157 million in the first nine months of the year versus $159 million during the same period last year. A large part of that spending was to support our global store network. For the full year, our plan is to open 11 company-operated stores. We also plan to relocate six stores and close six stores, and we expect square footage to increase by approximately 3%.", "We\u2019ve also been devoting significant portions of our CapEx budget to upgrade and enhance our IT systems, which we continue assess and evaluate. We believe these investments will over time make our supply chain more efficient, improve our in-store experience and generate incremental sales by leveraging both our CRM and omnichannel capabilities.", "Share repurchase activity continued throughout the quarter, with approximately 455,000 shares purchased at an average cost of just under $68 per share, which along with the dividend increase from earlier this year continues to demonstrate our practice of returning excess cash to our shareholders. Total short-term and long-term debt represented 38% of stockholders equity versus 37% last year.", "Looking forward, despite the modest sales improvement in the third quarter, we remain cautious about the near-term outlook for several reasons. First, overall global economic conditions remain highly volatile, so we would like to see several quarters of sales acceleration before making any conclusion that our turn in global luxury goods spending.", "Second, and as a practical matter, given the close proximity of our Fifth Avenue Flagship Store to the Trump Tower, we have noted that recent election related activity has caused the minor disruptions to pedestrian foot traffic around that store. Federal, state and local officials and Tiffany security personnel are all doing a fabulous job trying to minimize any disruptions. However, given the importance of the holiday selling season to our Flagship Store, we remain understandably cautious at the how this situation might impact sales over the coming weeks.", "Finally, we are mindful of the uncertainty which surround the upcoming Hong Kong elections next year and how that might impact tourism and spending in one of our largest markets.", "So taking all those into accounts and despite third quarter results coming in better than expected, we are holding to our previous annual forecast. Specifically, we continue to expect that full year sales will decline by a low single-digit percentage from the prior year and diluted EPS will decline by a mid single-digit percentage from last year's adjusted EPS, which you may recall excluded loan impairment and certain staffing and occupancy charges.", "These expectations are based on our plans and assumptions, including those set forth in the news release we issued earlier today. We expect to report Tiffany\u2019s holiday period sales results on January 17 and planned to follow that up with our year-end report later in March, when Frederic will join Mark and I for commentary and your questions.", "So, with that, let me turn the call back over to Mark.", "Mark Aaron", "Thanks, Mark. That concludes this conference call. [ph] Sharlon (16:42), please provide our audience with the replay information, and investors and analysts I look forward to speaking with you soon.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "A replay of today\u2019s call will begin November 29, 2016 at 9:30 a.m. Central Time and will end December 6, 2016 at 9:30 a.m. To access the replay, please dial 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820 and use the passcode of 8603179 to access the automated system.

Today's call is being recorded.", "Participating on today's call is Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations; Mr. Mark Erceg, Tiffany's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mr. Alessandro Bogliolo, Chief Executive Officer.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead.", "Mark Aaron", "Thank you and good day, everyone. On today's call, we are pleased that Tiffany's new CEO, Alessandro Bogliolo will begin by offering a few of his initial observations, which he will do in a moment. I will then review third quarter sales results, and Mark Erceg will comment on the rest of the financial results and forecast.", "Before continuing, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the planned, assumed, or expected results expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements.", "Additional information concerning factors, risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the news release filed today under cover of Form 8-K. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, except as required by applicable law or regulation.", "And now, I am pleased to introduce Alessandro Bogliolo.", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Thank you. I am pleased to have this opportunity to briefly introduce myself to you, and I look forward to meeting many of you in the coming months. Let me begin by saying that I am very excited to be here at Tiffany. I spent many years in the jewelry business at Bulgari, and I have long respected Tiffany as a house of extraordinary design and as a formidable competitor.", "In my first seven weeks at Tiffany, I have met with many members of our HQM regional teams, and I am impressed with their skills and passion for our unique brand. I have traveled and visited so far about 40 stores in the Americas, Asia-Pacific, and Japan, and I am very glad I also visited three of our manufacturing and logistic sites in the United States; in New York, Rohde Island, and the New Jersey.", "We have powerful internal operations with hundreds of truly exceptional jewelry artists, stone setters, hand engravers. It's thanks to them to their skills, their hands that Tiffany can offer such robust [ph] assortment from multimillion dollar one-of-the-kind creations to everyday jewelry with a consistent and supreme quality.", "I accepted this position because I strongly believe that the Tiffany & Co. brand is healthy with tremendous opportunities to grow. As we move forward, we will leverage our course plan and adapt as appropriate, while of course we will always remain true to our heritage and brand integrity. We will be accelerating the pace of product innovation. We are focused on the most effective marketing communications. We will continue to enhance the in-store and online experience, and our growth is reinforced by our strong supply chain capabilities and the solid financial position.", "I believe our company has the capabilities to further delight our customers, inspire our employees, and reward our shareholders. At the same time, we acknowledge that some of our competitors have recently posted stronger sales growth than us, which I can assure you, will not be acceptable in the long-term.", "I am increasingly passionate about Tiffany, and I am honored to be given this great opportunity. As I further study our business, I will be reviewing my thoughts with our Board of Directors, and will then have more to say to you in the coming months. I appreciate your interest in this great company. I can assure you that we will continue to work very persistently to achieve the healthy long-term financial performance that you have come to expect from us. Thank you.", "And now, I return the call back to Mark.", "Mark Aaron", "Okay. Thanks Alessandro for sharing those thoughts with us. Now, let's look at the results. As an overview, we were pleased with some of the underlying factors reflected in the third quarter results. Important to us was that total sales growth was again driven largely by higher jewelry unit volume, and not price. We were pleased to see a continuation of growth in fashion jewelry, and also encouraged to see a resumption of growth in the high fine and solitaire jewelry categories.", "Comparable store sales rose in the Americas and Asia-Pacific, but declined in Japan and Europe. Gross margin was up. SG&A expense growth was roughly in line with sales growth. Other expenses were unchanged, and the effective tax rate was a bit lower. The result was a 5% increase in net earnings which was a bit higher than what we had expected. We added net of three stores and introduced some new jewelry designs, a new watch collection, and a new fragrance.", "And organizationally, Alessandro joined Tiffany and our board of directors elected Roger Farah as its chairman. It was indeed a very active quarter. Let's look at performance in each region. In the Americas, sales rose slightly due to an increase in the number of jewelry unit sold across all categories except engagement jewelry. In the terms of the region's customer mix in the quarter, we attribute sales growth to higher spending by local customers while sales to foreign tourists continued to trend lower.", "It will be interesting in coming quarters to see whether there is any impact from the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar against certain currencies. Comp store sales rose 1% in the quarter. Results on a constant exchange rate basis were not materially different than as reported. And around the region, there were no significant variations in geographical performance worth highlighting.", "There has been quite a bit of recent store activity. During the quarter in the U.S., we opened a store in Fort Worth, Texas, representing our third store in the Dallas Fort Worth market. And we relocated our store in Century City, California. In our New York flagship store, we recently reopened our newly renovated fourth floor offering a dramatic new presentation and experience.", "The floor showcases our new home and accessories collection. And we are pleased to say that you can now enjoy your breakfast or lunch and tea at Tiffany in our newly opened Blue Box Cafe on the fourth floor. Based on the long queues every day, the cafe is fast becoming a New York tradition. For the first time ever, we recently opened to two pop-up shops in Manhattan in Rockefeller Center and in Grand Central Station, which are important hubs for both New Yorkers and tourists.", "These shops offer a curated selection by our Chief Artistic Officer, Reed Krakoff, of jewelry including the new hardware collection and gifts including the new home and accessories collection. And we are excited about the sales potential and brand exposure from those two shops. We also opened four pop-up shops in Holt Renfrew department stores in Canada. Now let's turn to the Asia-Pacific region which experienced growth in the quarter due to increased unit volume across jewelry categories.", "The region's sales increase came from a continuation of very strong comparable store sales growth in Mainland China, increased wholesale sales in Korea to support strong duty free sales, and the effect of new stores. Comp stores up 2% on a constant exchange rate basis. While we were pleased with sales growth in Mainland China, we were also encouraged to see sales in Hong Kong almost flat with last year after three years of substantial declines.", "However, comp declines some other countries which we attribute at least in part to lower Chinese tourist spending, affected the region's overall results. During the quarter, we opened one store in Wuxi, China, and have several openings and relocations planned in the fourth quarter. The picture was reasonably good in Japan. Sales declined on a GAAP basis due to a weakening of the yen versus the dollar. However, third quarter sales were equal to last year on a constant exchange rate basis.", "A decline in jewelry unit sold was offset by an increase in average price. So as a reminder, the number of unit sold had a large increase last year. Comp sales stores decreased on a GAAP basis, but on a constant exchange rate basis were flat. We are planning for a tough comparison in the fourth quarter when we go up against the comp store sales increase last year that we believe was at least partly tied to extensive favorable publicity from a popular television show.", "There were no store openings or closings during the quarter. Turning to Europe, we saw a mixed result. Total sales were up on a GAAP basis due to increased price and volume. The pound and euro have strengthened in recent months which bolstered GAAP results. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales were up slightly and comps declined. On continental Europe, total sales rose in most countries.", "Sales declined in the U.K. but keep in mind the very strong growth at this time last year when spending that we attributed to foreign tourists in London was surging in reaction to the weaker pound. During the quarter, we added to our successful business in Russia when we opened a second store in the heart of Moscow on Petrovka Street. And we opened a store in Birmingham, England in Selfridges Department Store, representing our eleventh store in the U.K.", "Lastly, sales in our other segment declined in the quarter entirely due to lower wholesales sales of diamonds. This segment also includes four stores that we operate in the UAE. And we are pleased to see that their comps improved with a 7% increase in the third quarter. We closed our store in Abu Dhabi mall during the quarter, but expect to replace it with a new store in the Abu Dhabi Galleria next year.", "In addition to these sales highlights, I should point out that ecommerce sales increased at a slightly faster pace than overall sales growth. We will certainly continue to invest in the online channel and digital marketing, but believe that most customers after getting their information online still are and will continue to be attracted to the in-store experience.", "Looking at product categories in total for the quarter, we continue to see solid growth in the fashion jewelry category. We're very pleased with the results in the Tiffany hardware collection which we launched earlier in the year, and recently added new SKUs to the collection. We also recently expanded our very successful Tiffany tea collection.", "Near the end of the quarter, we launched an interesting build-your-own program on our Web site that allows customers to construct and personalize their own charm bracelets, and it's worth pointing out the growth in our Tiffany keys collection, which spans both fashion and fine jewelry and includes new fleur de lis design in earring, pendants, and rings. In the high fine and solitaire jewelry category, we were pleased to see a resumption of growth in the quarter led by iconic diamond jewelry designs which included extensions of existing collection.", "In that regard, it's worth mentioning the popular Victoria yellow diamond and Soleste collection. And we had a solid increase in the high jewelry sales in the quarter. Partly offsetting growth in those categories was engagement jewelry where sales continued to underperform in the quarter. While Tiffany offers a wide ranging and we believe dominant diamond ring assortments, we have also observed that some customers wanted to customize their own rings.", "As a result, we recently introduced a program in our stores in the U.S. and Canada that allows customers to personalize their ring by separately choosing a diamond cut, setting, and metal. We're pleased with progress in several non-jewelry categories as well. In watches, we saw a good growth in the quarter, and there has been very favorable initial reactions to our new Tiffany Metro Watch collection for women.", "We also launched our new signature fragrance in the quarter which is now available in Tiffany stores as well as in other select stores globally. And as I mentioned earlier, we recently introduced our new home and accessories collection both online and our stores. The already popular collection spans more than 300 item, both functional and whimsical in a wide range of price point and is now being distributed worldwide.", "We've met with many of you in recent months and I want to reiterate that Tiffany's top strategic priority is to drive solid comparable store sales growth. While we expect square footage to increase modestly each year in the future, it is comparable store and e-commerce sales growth through increased frequency of customer visits and the conversion rates that will ultimately contribute to driving higher margins and earnings growth.", "With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Mark Erceg.", "Mark Erceg", "Thanks Mark, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter results reflect continued progress towards our long-term financial goals, which include mid single-digit sales growth and high single-digit diluted earnings per share growth.", "Worldwide sales growth of 3% in the quarter is obviously below that range, but importantly, some sequential progress was made in comp store sales, which were down 1% in the third quarter after being down 3% in the first quarter and down 2% in the second quarter. And net earnings growth of 5% in the third quarter brings fiscal year-to-date diluted earnings per share growth to plus 7% versus year ago. So, while we are encouraged with third quarter results, we also acknowledge that we have a lot more work to do, and that the risk of stating the obvious we will not be satisfied until we achieve meaningful and sustainable comparable store sales growth across all regions.", "Moving to gross margin; gross margin increased by 30 basis points due in part due to a decline in wholesale diamond sales. Sales mix was on a meaningful contributor to the increase as sales growth was generally balanced across a wide range of price points and product categories. Also, while we have continued to benefit from lower commodity input costs, we are seeing that benefit diminish as the year goes on, which is consistent with our prior expectations. We now expect gross margin to be roughly unchanged for the full year.", "Selling, general, and administrative expenses were roughly in line with sales growth in the third quarter with the increased tied to increased labor and incentive compensation costs, as well as higher store depreciation and occupancy costs partly offset by various ongoing cost savings initiatives. On a year-to-date basis, SG&A expenses have grown 2.4%, versus reported sales growth of 2.3%.", "Consistent what has been previously stated, we remain committed to managing SG&A expense prudently and reducing costs where feasible in order to free up investment dollars to reinvest in the growth of our business. Modest gross margin expansion coupled with SG&A expenses growing in line with sales allowed third quarter operating margin to expand by 10 basis points. Our full year forecast calls for operating margin to increase over last year as reported, but to be roughly in line with last year's margins when charges are excluded.", "Interest and other expenses were essentially unchanged in the quarter, and we expect it to be in the range of $35 million to $37 million for the full year. From a tax standpoint, the third quarter effective tax rate was 33.4%, which was more than four points below last year's rate of 34.6%. Nonetheless, 2017's full year effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 33%.", "Net inventories at October 31 were only 1% above last year, which is below the rate of sales growth, which you may recall that at July 31 of this year, inventory was 4% below year ago. Simply put, we've increased our internal manufacturing targets over the past couple of months for several key gold products that have been selling faster-than-expected which in turn has pushed up raw material and work in process inventory levels. Because of this change, we now expect net inventories for the year to increase at approximately the same rate as sales growth.", "Capital expenditures year-to-date were $146 million, and our full year forecast which assumed approximately $250 million in spending has been revised slightly downwards with our best estimates now being somewhere in the $235 million to $250 million range. The revision is solely due to timing expenditures as we continue to anticipate annual CapEx spending of somewhere between 6% and 7% of sales. We invested $28 million in the third quarter to buy shares at an average cost of $92 per share, which is slightly up from $21 million we invested during the second quarter, and more than doubled the $11 million we invested during the first quarter.", "Tiffany's balance sheet remains strong having finished the third quarter with $1 billion of cash in short-term investments and total debt representing only one-third of stockholders equity. Putting in all together, we continue to expect total sales for the full year to increase by low single-digits and our forecast for diluted EPS continues to call for a high single-digit increase over last year's $3.55 per share on a GAAP basis, and the mid single-digit increase over last year's $3.75 per share, excluding charges.", "Relative to cash, we remain on pace with our expectations to deliver approximately $700 million of net operating cash flow and approximately $450 million of free cash flow for the full year.", "So, in closing, while progress was made in the quarter, we remain focused on sharpening our strategies and improving our execution in order to generate sustainable comp store sales growth and consistent diluted earnings per share growth.", "I will now turn the call back over to Mark.", "Mark Aaron", "Thanks, Mark and Alessandro for your insights. Everyone please note that we expect to report our November-December holiday sales results on January 17. As a reminder, we do not have a conference call of that release. Beyond that, we expect to report our full year financial results in mid-March when we will have a conference call with time for Q&A with Alessandro and Mark.", "For today, please feel free to call me with any questions or comments. Thanks for listening.", "Operator", "And that does conclude today's conference. A replay of this call will be available as of 10:30 AM Eastern time today, and will be available until December 6, 2017. To access the replay, please dial 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820.

On today's call, I am pleased to have our CEO Alessandro Bogliolo and; and our CFO, Mark Erceg here with me, to share some observations, insights and commentary about Tiffany's recent performance, strategies, and outlook. We will then allow time to answer your questions, and I should add, that going forward we will take questions on all future calls as well.", "Before continuing, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements.

The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.

Both filings could be found on Tiffany's investor web site, www.tiffany.com, by selecting financial information in the left hand column.", "So I believe we can now proceed, and I will turn the call over to Alessandro.", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Thank you, Mark. Good morning. I would like to share a few thoughts with all of you and then later, we will be pleased to answer your questions. As you know, I joined Tiffany last October, and I can tell you that I am increasingly excited about the capabilities of this amazing company, the growth opportunities available to us and the very talented and dedicated people work here in all aspects of our business.", "In my first six months, I have been pursuing a strategic assessment of our business with my senior management colleagues, and with active review by our Board of Directors. We all believe that our brand is remarkably powerful.", "Our mission is to be makers of beauty, creators of joy. Simply put, Tiffany brings beautiful enduring designs to larger than life, that would be cherished for generations.", "Our artisans craft some of the world's finest jewelry, timepieces and accessories, yet everybody's ultimate purpose at Tiffany is to create memorable moments of joy for our customers.", "We have also agreed on the strategic direction that we must follow. One, that I would characterize somewhat as an evolution of where Tiffany has been. But we also agree, that we need to accelerate the pace of execution of those strategies, and we need to increase the required investment spending to achieve the sustainable sales and earnings growth that I believe Tiffany is capable of.", "The outcome of our strategic review is a set of six priorities, that will be totally focused on as we move forward.", "Now the first priority is amplifying an evolved brand message. We have already begun to see some evolution in our marketing communications, through a variety of media. The above messaging will be more evident to you, as the year progresses, and one example is our recent Believe in Love marketing campaign.", "Our second priority is renewing our product offerings and financing the in-store presentation. We will accomplish that through an accelerated rate of product introductions across all categories. Specifically, our new jewelry design and innovation workshop will be instrumental in developing more distinctive units in jewelry.", "Importantly, we have also planned and allocated resources to evolve the visual merchandising of assortments in our stores.", "Third, while Tiffany has made progress in its e-commerce past years, our efforts are now focused on delivering a seamless omnichannel customer experience. We all know that our customers are more fluid than ever in their shopping, and we must enhance our capabilities and functionalities to match the growing and evolving expectations, whether in Tiffany stores or on our web sites.", "As we grow our business, our fourth priority is to calculate a more efficient operating model. We intend to achieve that through the continuation of a major revamp of our IT systems, and their vision of selected core processes, such as procurement, all while restraining expense growth when appropriate, so that we can ultimately drive margin growth.", "Our fifth priority is to inspire and align an agile organization to win. I said before, that Tiffany organization is filled with talented and dedicated people, and I would add passionate to that description. Now, with a clear direction and a shared sense of urgency, everyone from our longest tenured to our newest colleagues, is called upon to focus on healthy and sustainable acceleration of growth.", "Following from all of these initiatives, is the final priority to strengthen our competitive position and lead in key markets. The global jewelry and luxury industry is competitively fragmented, and our brand strength and global reach position us very well. Our regional teams are empowered to leverage their relationships with customers, and that the power of our physical and digital network to increase the brand relevance, and thus market share in local communities.", "As I said on the last call, I accepted this position because I strongly believe that the Tiffany and Co. brand is healthy, but it also has tremendous opportunities to grow. At least in line with, if not better than our industry peers.", "As we move forward, we will leverage our core strength and adapt as appropriate, while of course, always remaining true to our heritage and brand integrity.", "Well, I will stop here and allow Mark and Mark to make some comments before we take your questions. I will just add that I look forward to meeting some of you in the coming weeks and months, and appreciate your interest in this great company. Thank you.", "Mark Aaron", "Thanks Alessandro for sharing those insights. Now let's look at the financial results. I hope all of you on the call have had an opportunity to read the news release, so I will just focus on some key highlights of our performance.", "These fourth quarter sales results are pretty consistent with the holiday sales reports that we reported in January, which had indicated improvements in our business by region and across product categories. We had varying degrees of sales growth in the quarter in all regions, ranging from total sales growth of 13% in Europe to 2% in Japan. Although the performance was a bit different when viewed on a constant exchange rate basis.", "We also had growth in all product categories, ranging from the strongest growth in the Jewelry Collections category, to fractional growth in the Engagement Jewelry category, and that regional sales growth was driven by increased unit volume.", "We saw a decline in gross margin in the quarter, as we expected, and an increase in SG&A expense, and net earnings were pretty much in line with our forecast.", "Let's look at performance in each regions; in the Americas after beginning 2017 with declining sales, there was some improvement as the year progressed, and we were pleased to finish the year with a solid sales increase in total, and on a comp basis in the fourth quarter, that was generated by continued increase in jewelry units sold. E-commerce sales also had a solid increase in the quarter and full year.", "Sales growth in the quarter was geographically broad based across the U.S., Canada and Latin America, and it was largely comprised of higher spending attributed to local customers.", "While spending attributed to foreign tourists in the quarter was unchanged from the prior year, that is nonetheless an improvement from the past couple of years, when we face the challenge of a strong U.S. dollar and its negative repercussions on tourist spending here.", "For all of 2017, we estimate that the spending attributed to foreign tourists represented a bit less than 20% of the U.S. sales. It was modest store activity in the region, and we finished 2017 operating 124 stores in the Americas, including 94 in the U.S., 13 in Canada and 17 in Latin America.", "In addition to opening one store, we also tested some top-up stores in the latter part of the year, that we do not include in the store count, and have been quite pleased with their results. And as we noted on our last call, we renovated the fourth floor of our New York Flagship store to showcase our new home and accessories collection and to open our first ever Blue Box Caf\u00e9, which has fast become a New York tradition.", "Results of the Asia Pacific region were mixed in the fourth quarter and in the full year as well, but total Asia Pacific sales did increase in every quarter in 2017, partly reflecting the opening of new stores.", "We were pleased with sales growth in Mainland China throughout the year and we returned to growth in Hong Kong in the fourth quarter, after three years of declines. Sales in greater China represented roughly 60% of Asia Pacific region sales in 2017, similar to the prior year. Results were less favorable in some other countries, which we attribute at least partly to lower spending by Chinese tourists. However, it's worth noting very strong, wholesale sales growth in Korea throughout the year, which, while not included in our comp store sales, reflect duty free sales demand that we attribute largely to Chinese tourists.", "Overall, jewelry unit volume was up in both the fourth quarter and year. During the year, we opened five stores in the Asia Pacific region, closed three, relocated four and renovated many, and finished the year operating 87 stores in the region.", "We were pleased with results in Japan throughout the year, although results fluctuated from quarter-to-quarter due to some difficult year-over-year comparisons. Most spending in Japan is attributed to local customers, and there was no discernible pattern to changes in unit volume and price in the quarter or the year. We closed one store in Japan in 2017 and finished the year operating 54 stores.", "In Europe, total sales increased in the quarter and full year, as reported in dollars, primarily reflecting the translation effect of stronger European currencies, and through major new store openings in Milan and Moscow, which we believe negatively affected existing store sales.", "Performance was soft across much of the region and the U.K. continued to represent about 40% of European sales. In addition, the growth was largely generated by higher spending that we attribute to local customers, which we estimate represent about three quarters of our European sales. And we were pleased with growth in jewelry unit volume in both periods.", "The picture was a bit different in Europe on a constant exchange rate basis, while total sales rose in both periods, but to a lesser extent, and as reported in dollars, comp store sales on that basis declined in both periods. During the year, we opened three stores in Europe and finished the year with 46 stores in the region.", "Other sales growth in the quarter and year, primarily resulted from increased wholesale sales of diamonds. We also operate four stores in the UAE and comparable store sales rose modestly.", "In terms of the sales productivity, for the year, we achieved worldwide sales per square foot for company operated stores, up $2,700 in 2017, which was approximately in line with 2016. This resulted from our sales growth and the 3% increase in square footage.", "By region, sales productivity ranged from $3,800 in the Asia Pacific to $3,600 in Japan, to $2,300 in Europe, and to $2,200 per square foot in the Americas. Now keep in mind, that these productivity levels are calculated in U.S. dollars, so the numbers could vary, based on currency changes.", "Looking at the coming year, we are currently planning to open nine stores, including at least one in each region, close two stores, and relocate at least 15 existing stores, primarily in the Americas and Asia Pacific, and continue to renovate many stores. This is all expected to equate to an increase in global square footage of approximately 2%.", "Beyond stores, we are increasingly looking at an overall omnichannel perspective. You just heard Alessandro say that we will be more focused on optimizing our omnichannel presence and capabilities. We were pleased with e-commerce sales growth in the quarter and the year, which worldwide, increased at a slightly faster pace than overall sales growth. We also believe that a complete omnichannel view should include not only e-commerce sales, but also sales generated through our catalogs.", "Taking that full view, indicates those non-retail sales accounted for 7% of worldwide sales in 2017, which was consistent with the past two years. I should add that beginning with the first quarter of 2018, we will report comparable sales for the periods presented on an omnichannel basis, which combines company operated retail store sales performance, with sales generated by our web sites and catalogs.", "Lastly, we still strongly believe that our web site and catalogs, also serve as a powerful information source and are catalysts for customers to visit our stores for unique in-store experience.", "There are several things to point out regarding product performance. First, from a reporting perspective, you should note that we are now combining the previously reported Fashion Jewelry and the High, Fine and Solitaire Jewelry categories into one new category called Jewelry Collections to parallel the way that we are now internally analyzing our jewelry assortments, as well as reflecting how customers shop for jewelry.", "Additionally, the designs of Jean Schlumberger, which was previously reported within the High, Fine and Solitaire Jewelry category, has been reclassified into the Designer Jewelry category, and we made no changes to the Engagement Jewelry category.", "You can see this new presentation of product category sales by region in the report on Form 10-K that we filed with the SEC this morning.", "Looking at it the old way or the new way, we were pleased with improving sales trends as the year progressed. The Jewelry Collections category posted growth throughout the year, with improvement over the course of the year, and finished the year on a strong note. Sales in the designer jewelry category increased in the quarter and the year, and the Engagement Jewelry category finished the year, with a fractional sales increase in the fourth quarter, but it's full year sales were lower than 2016.", "Complementing jewelry as our collection of watches, and we were very pleased with sales growth in 2017, and our new home and accessories collection gave a strong boost to that area, when it was launched in the fourth quarter.", "Speaking of innovation, it was a relatively active year. In addition to the Home and Accessories collection, we introduced the Tiffany hardware jewelry collection, and added new designs in existing Jewelry Collections, such as within the Tiffany T, Return to Tiffany and the Keys Collections. We introduced the Tiffany Metro watch collection, and we launched our new signature fragrance with great success.", "But as Alessandro said earlier, one of our strategic priorities is to accelerate the rate of product introductions. As one example, we will soon launch a new jewelry collection, focused on platinum and diamonds, our first in many years, and there will certainly be other newness during the year.", "I hope you now have a good understanding of our sales performance from a geographical and product perspective, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Mark Erceg for some comments on the rest of the income statement, the balance sheet and our 2018 guidance.", "Mark Erceg", "Thanks Mark and good morning everyone. From a financial standpoint, 2017 was an interesting year. On the one hand, comparable store sales were flat, which is clearly below our long term growth target. On the other hand, while net earnings per share declined, due to tax charges, net earnings per share on a pro forma basis, excluding charges in both years, were up 10%. We also generated very strong cash flow, with $932 million of cash flow from operations and $693 million of free cash flow for the year. Finally, we returned significant amounts of capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends, where we increased our quarterly dividend by 11% and through the repurchase of $99 million of stock, at an average price of $95 per share.", "The cash flow generation in 2017 certainly reflected strong earnings. In addition, an increase in accounts payable was partly tied to more effective management of payables, but also to the timing of inventory purchases in the fourth quarter, and lastly, tax payments were lower.", "Now these results tell me several things; first, we are doing a much better job managing cost, as evidenced by the fact that for the full year, SG&A expense as a percentage of sales, again, on a pro forma basis, excluding charges in 2016, was virtually flat versus prior year for the first time in four years.", "Second, although we slightly increased marketing support as a percentage of sales during 2017, we should be investing more to support and amplify the Tiffany brand, which we believe has tremendous upside potential.", "Third, having finished the year at $1.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, and with short term and long term total debt, representing only 31% of stockholders equity, we have the financial strength to continue investing in our business, and also return cash to our shareholders.", "Ultimately, our long term objective is to drive solid and sustainable growth in both comparable store and online sales, to increase customer visits and higher conversion rates, in order to drive higher total sales, expand margins, and grow earnings.", "Being mindful of the fact that these long term goals will only be achieved, if we increase investment now, and properly execute the strategic priorities Alex has laid out, we are maintaining our guidance for the coming year, which we had disclosed on a preliminary basis, excluding the potential impact of recent U.S. tax reform, back in January.", "Specifically, we expect 2018 pre-tax earnings to be flat to slightly down from last year, and net earnings to increase over last year's non-GAAP earnings, after taking into account a lower tax rate.", "Importantly, in saying this, we acknowledge that pro forma earnings per share just grew by 10% in the year, when comparable store sales were flat, and while we expect an improvement in comparable store sales growth during 2018, we are also planning to make significant investments in technology, marketing and communications, visual merchandising, digital and store presentation. These are all investments which we believe are ultimately needed to generate sustained mid-single digit sales and high single digit earnings per share growth.", "With that said, let's take a few minutes to discuss U.S. corporate tax reform, which reduced the statutory corporate tax rate to 21%, but also added several new complexities, impacting both our 2017 results, as well as future earnings.", "The $1.17 per share charge we reported during the fourth quarter of 2017 on a GAAP basis, was primarily comprised of three items; first, the transition tax is a onetime tax on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which drove a charge of $56 million or $0.45 per share.", "Second, we were required to remeasure the carrying value of our deferred tax assets, to reflect the new statutory rate of 21%, which resulted in a tax charge of $95 million or $0.76 per share.", "Finally, since the new tax law went into effect January 1 -- but our fiscal year ended January 31, we realized a $5 million or $0.04 per share benefit from having a lower statutory tax rate in the U.S. in effect for one month.", "With respect to the 2017 transition tax, the cash tax payment will be made in installments over an eight year period beginning in 2018. The expected tax implications for 2018 and beyond, likely will require a bit more explanation.", "For many companies, particularly those of little to no domestic manufacturing and quick inventory turns, the effect of a change in the U.S. corporate tax rate may be realized in the financial statements, immediately post enactment. However, because we manufacture a large portion of our jewelry in the U.S., sell it to our international affiliates and have relatively long inventory turns, we expect to see a gradual phasing in, before we realize the full benefit of the lower statutory rate.", "This is because while we pay tax on the intercompany profit on these sales from the U.S. to our international affiliates, when the intercompany sale occurs, U.S. GAAP requires that the profit and the associated U.S. tax expense be deferred for financial reporting purposes, until the merchandise is sold by our global affiliates to our customers.", "The simple way to think about it is, that when our global affiliates sell merchandise, they purchase intercompany from the U.S. Prior to 2018, the associated tax on the intercompany profit recognized from the sale of that merchandise, will reflect the historical 35% statutory tax rate.", "As a practical matter, this means we will not realize the full benefit of U.S. tax reform, until all of the individual items our global affiliates had on hand, or were in transit, as of December 31, 2017 are physically sold.", "With this understanding, we expect an overall 2018 effective tax rate of somewhere in the high 20% area, before seeing a further stepdown in rate in 2019.", "Now with respect to the balance of the 2018 P&L, there is just a handful of things we'd like to point out. We have built our 2018 financial plan assuming mid single digit sales growth, the majority of which we expect to come from comparable sales growth.", "Gross margin should expand, due to somewhat lower diamond input costs, with the balance coming from product mix and pricing, including a low single digit price increase. But SG&A expense growth, due to the investments we will be making, is expected to exceed worldwide sales growth. So all in, our sales and earnings guidance implies a decline in operating margin in 2018.", "However, once higher levels of SG&A spending are annualized, and assuming healthy sales growth, we expect to resume operating margin expansion in 2019 and beyond, and to reiterate what we have said before, we do not believe there is any structural barrier, which would preclude Tiffany from meaningfully improving its operating margin over the long term.", "One of the key projects we are investing behind, is our foundational information technology platforms. A year ago, you may recall, that we took a $25 million charge to write-off certain developmental efforts associated with our IT replatforming. Today, we are pleased to report that we recently stood up our first key geographic market, as we continue to work towards the development of our new information systems platform, as part of a multiyear rollout plan, which when completed, is expected to dramatically improve our business and omnichannel capabilities.", "Interest and other expenses should be roughly in line with 2017 levels. All of this, excluding taxes, including the effect of the recent changes to U.S. corporate tax law, would be expected to result in 2018 earnings per share being flat to slightly down from 2017's net earnings per diluted share on a pro forma basis. However, after factoring in and passing through the full benefit of a 2018 overall effective tax rate, somewhere in the high 20s, we expect net earnings to increase to somewhere between $4.25 to $4.45 per diluted share. Within that, we expect first quarter earnings to be up versus a year ago, after which the phasing in of increased investment spending should have some effect on year-over-year earnings growth over the balance of the year.", "We are planning for inventory growth, in line with sales growth in 2018, as we invest more in certain categories, and anticipate CapEx spending continuing between 6% and 7% of sales.", "Based on our forecast for net earnings, in the balance sheet, we are projecting approximately $660 million of cash flow from operations and approximately $380 million of free cash flow in 2018, which is lower than the prior year, largely due to the timing of payables and taxes in late 2017.", "So in summary, despite a moderate increase in top line performance in 2017, we delivered solid pro form earnings per share growth, strong cash results and continue to return cash to our shareholders. Our brand remains strong, and we have a clear set of strategic priorities, which we are committed to executing against, as well as the balance sheet to fund those activities; and by making the clear declaration, that we are going to be managing this 108 year old business for the long term benefit of our shareholders, we are investing what we believe requires to generate solid returns and drive sustainable, mid-single digit sales and high single digit earnings per share growth annually over the long term.", "I will now turn the call back to Mark.", "Mark Aaron", "Well thanks Mark and Alessandro. And now I will turn the call back to the operator, so we can answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. We will go first with David Schick from Consumer Edge Research.", "David Schick", "Hi. Thank you. Good morning. My first question is just a quick question on any impact of Chinese New Year movement into mid-February from late January, and how you feel about the fourth quarter numbers?", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Well, thank you, David for your question. Well as you all know, Chinese New Year shifted a little bit compared to the previous year. So this had a slight effect on our retail sales, but actually, the way we look at the results, is every year, we try to neutralize these effects of shifting in calendar, so [ph] there was this effect.", "David Schick", "Okay. So you feel, it did not affect the reported regional comp for 4Q?", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "[indiscernible].", "David Schick", "Okay. And then the second question is, you know, sort of a bigger picture question is, there is a lot of moving pieces to what you are talking about, with your -- and thanks so much for laying out the six pieces of the strategic planning. Some of which are adding costs in the near term as different revenue drivers go at work. I guess, a sense for all of us on the call, of how much is undoing older initiatives, whether it's around IT, some of the things that were already started, certainly in merchandising or in the in-store presentation, or the digital, so how much is an unwind versus an amplification or an acceleration of projects that have been going on, for say a year or longer?", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Well I guess, your question refers maybe to a write-off we had some years ago, about certain investments in our IT technology. But honestly, okay, that was few years ago, but honestly, what I see is not really about unwinding, about restructuring or cutting, but it's really about building. I think that, when it comes to the barriers aspects of our business, you can call it the infrastructure, the technology, we had a lot to build there, for future growth. Likewise, when it comes to the product offering, we have a very strong product offering, but we are really committed to come with more newness and more distinctive newness, but honestly I think that the brand after six months in the job, is really healthy. So it's not about curing problems, but actually to build on a very solid basis.", "David Schick", "Thank you. Very helpful.", "Operator", "We will go next go to Paul Lejuez with Citi.", "Paul Lejuez", "Hey, thanks guys. On the relaunch of Home, I am curious what you learned, what did you work and what's next on that product line? And if you can share comp performance of that line of business in the fourth quarter, how much of that helped 4Q comps? Thanks.", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Sure. Thank you for your questions. Actually, Home and Accessories has been a very meaningful test for us, because it has been substantial newness that has been introduced in that product category, with the leadership of Reed Krakoff, and for me, it was meaningful price.", "First of all, for sales, because actually it has generated a nice double digit growth in that category, which of course, is important and we are pleased with. But it was even more important for me, because of the reaction of the consumer to meaningful innovation. And in retrospect, the test was extremely positive and this is what makes me confident about accelerating the pace of innovation, because we can see and we can measure that when we do something new, that is truly innovative and different, consumers, customers, react in a very positive way. So the connection between customers and the brand is there and is solid.", "Paul Lejuez", "Anything particular within the line, that stood out as being a big driver of sales, versus maybe if it wasn't as successful?", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Always referring to the Home and Accessories; well, that is a category that -- I mean, we call it one category, but in reality it's a mix of very different items, because it ranges from silver to gifts to crystals to many. So honestly, it has been an overall success, it is not being driven by a particular sub-category. So I will say, it was overall positive across the categories.", "Paul Lejuez", "Okay. Thank you guy. Good luck.", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Simeon Siegel with Nomura.", "Simeon Siegel", "Thanks. Good morning. Recognizing what looks like a January deceleration off a difficult compare, any color you could provide on current trends from then? And then just more broadly, Alessandro, can you talk about your store strategy? You have now successfully opened up pop-ups, it seems like you are looking for more remodels -- relocations, rather than in the past. So any change to how you are thinking about your stores versus the past? Thanks.", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Yes. Thank you for the question. Well actually, what is really relevant for me, is going forward, about the stores; because the stores are really the place, where our customers can feel the entire experience of the brand, and when I say stores, I mean, of course, the physical stores, but let's not forget also the non-physical stores that are our web sites, where the traffic is huge. So stores are definitely one of the key areas of attention and the investment for us going forward, which doesn't mean to increase dramatically, the number of stores, it's not about that.", "Our story is and want to be a story of like-for-like. But what we want to dramatically improve and modernize, is the experience for customers in our stores. So this is why we also mentioned, I think Mark was very clear about that, about this need of increasing investments in areas such as visual merchandising, store presentations, because we want to make a difference, and we are working on that, in order to finance the newness and the icons in our stores, for the benefit and better experience of our customers.", "Simeon Siegel", "Thank you.", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie.", "Laurent Vasilescu", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Can you provide updated thoughts regarding the vertical integration of the supply chain? According to this morning's 10-K, I think 60% of your jewelry is still produced internally. Any color on vertical integration, how it should evolve this year and beyond would be appreciated?", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Thank you Laurent for your question, because I am very-very proud of our supply chain, because I really believe that Tiffany is really a best-in-class in our luxury when it comes to it, not only selling and marketing skills, but also to the craftsmanship, prototyping and manufacturing of products.", "So it's true, we are a vertically integrated company, and we are in jewelry making, where you are right, but depends on the year, about 60%, 65% of our jewelry is manufactured, made in-house, in several sites in the U.S. And I think that this ratio, which is substantial, is a strength of the company, because this allows us to, first of all, to be independent when it comes to product capacity. But even more so, to really master the way we make the products and the cost of it. Now, I would never go to 100% of the internal production, because that would just make our system too rigid, but let's say, 60-40, two-third, one-third is a very-very healthy kind of ratio.", "Now even more specific for Tiffany, differently from other global jewelers is our vertical integration in diamonds. Now for me, this is not only a strength, but is a real point of difference; because when it comes to diamonds, the fact that we have internal capabilities to cut and polish the rough diamond, that means that we master the craftmanship of diamonds, and this is one of the reasons, and an important one, why Tiffany is rightfully so, considered the brand that stands for diamonds in the market. It's of course, a matter of legacy, 130 years ago we designed the Tiffany setting, it's a matter of size, because of our sales volumes in this category, but it was a matter of expertise, and this is what really makes a brand great and set for leadership.", "Simeon Siegel", "Thank you for that. And as a follow-up, the prepared remarks called out strong cash flow generation tied to more effective management of payables and inventory purchases. Should we expect further opportunities around working capital in 2018? Are there any target metrics you are willing to share around inventory turns and days payable outstanding?", "Mark Erceg", "Yeah. It's a great question. One of the things we have been talking about, is the new information architecture and platforms that we are putting in place. One of the things that that will bring for us, is much better visibility across our payable spend pool. We have 35,000 active suppliers, and we don't currently have best in class systems to allow us to manage that appropriately. You will see us doing better with working capital, as a result of the initiatives that we are driving, capturing discount payment terms, getting to electronic receipt, all those types of things will make us a much more efficient company, and it will generate additional working capital on the positive side, which will help us then fund other investments that we may choose to make, as we drill out more product innovation, which may require slightly higher levels of inventory.", "Mark Aaron", "And let me just add, Laurent, I will just add that, we also did mention that there was a timing issue on some of that as well at the end of the quarter, and that's the reason that we are forecasting somewhat lower free cash flow for 2018. So yes, we are certainly getting more effective and efficient on that, but there was some timing shift from late 2017 into 2018.", "Laurent Vasilescu", "Thank you and best of luck.", "Operator", "We will go next to Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.", "Lorraine Hutchinson", "Thank you. Good morning. Alessandro, as you review the business, have you found any other pockets of sales opportunities, be it categories or channels that the brand has not targeted before?", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Thank you, Lorraine, for your question. As we all know, the large majority of sales revenues of Tiffany is from jewelry. Now having -- so I would answer your question two ways; first, let's look at what is not jewelry. I mean, we have watches, that for me, is an absolute priority. It's something that is important for any jeweler in the world, is a category where the brand, even if we go back in history to Mr. Tiffany, was in the 19th century, very much devoted and interested in this, and it's a must. So this is a category, where I truly believe, we are putting a lot of efforts in it. We all know, that is a category where growth and development is slow, but we are absolutely determined to go that path, in order to achieve the position that this brand deserves in the world of watches and especially, women's watches.", "Then, the Home and Accessories category, we just -- as I mentioned some comments before, it's an equally important one. I mean, Tiffany has a special competitive advantage in that area, and I think we should keep on exploiting it, as we have started redoing from the last quarter of 2017.", "And there is fragrances, where last year has been very important for the launch of our new fragrance. It's through a license, as you know, but it's a product that is very poetic and that is in my opinion, perfectly in line with Tiffany, with the world of Tiffany, our values and also our customer's profile. So these are three, let me say, categories outside of jewelry, where we are totally focused on, and I think we will have a lot to do, but also great satisfaction going forward.", "Now I would go back to the other 90% of the business, which is jewelry. When we talk about that, jewelry is a group of very diverse categories, subcategories usage price points, and I tell you, I see a lot of opportunities in the different segments of the jewelry where we operate. And if you want, that is the lower hanging fruit, for a company that has been leading in jewelry for 108 years, and that has all the capabilities to do that. So I am honestly very-very confident also on that side. What we are not considering in the short or medium term, are diversifications in very different kind of businesses from this.", "Lorraine Hutchinson", "And then, as some of these categories become larger portions of the business, does wholesale become a bigger part of your revenue mix?", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Well with the exception of fragrances, where obviously the wholesale is the natural business model. For the other categories, I think that one of the key strengths of Tiffany, is the fact of having a fleet of mono-brand directly on stores, that is very powerful, and the fact that those products can be purchased only in a Tiffany environment. I think, is an enormous strength, that is limited to very-very few, less than a handful of brands, luxury brands. Tiffany is one of those, and I would definitely stick to that.", "Lorraine Hutchinson", "Thank you.", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Erwan Rambourg with HSBC.", "Erwan Rambourg", "Yes hi, good morning gentlemen. Thanks a lot for the Q&A today and in the future. I had three questions; one is more sort of helicopter view for Alessandro. There has been historically, a sort of dichotomy in the brand between affordability and then higher end. You have a background, where you have obviously worked for an exuberant high-end Roman jeweler, but also you have worked for more fast moving consumer type goods. I am just wondering, how do you think about the dichotomy within Tiffany between affordable goods and goods that are more in line with some of the European peers? How do you think about your competitive positioning and where would you push in the future?", "Secondly, just a question on jewelry for this year. I had in mind that you had a new platform or a new product launch that was quite important for the year to come. I am wondering if you could, maybe mention what the product pipeline is there? And then thirdly, sorry a bit of a technical question, maybe for Mark, very clear on the tax rate taking a while to come down, because you have to basically get the benefit only if you have shipped products for the first of January 2018. In an ideal situation, where 100% of the products are there, where do you see the sort of exit rate of the tax rate going? Whether it's in late 2019 or in 2020? Thank you.", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Thank you Erwan for your questions. Well, on the first question, first of all, I think this dichotomy of the brand is a great thing, because this was probably one of the reasons why I was hired for this job, having the experience on both extremes of the product range. But now, apart from jokes, Tiffany has since -- more than essentially almost two centuries, has the capabilities of offering women, and in general, customers products that are of very high quality in a wide price range. Now I consider this a blessing. Also because it's not an offer that is bifurcated in something, let me say, very cheap, and something very expensive. That's not the case. The offer in Tiffany is very well structured, starting from, we can say 100 -- I mean, if I think about, for example, the famous silver bracelet at $180, up to $1,000, $2,000, $5,000, $10,000, $15,000, $50,000, $100,000, and then we are on top, $1 million, $2 million, $3 million, $5 million. So it's a very well stratified kind of offer, that I find it extremely modeled, because this is the way customers, and especially women, shop today.", "At the end of the day, all these different products, that as we can analyze in different price ranges, but at the end of the day, they are all products for the adorning of a person, and that ends up in the same jewelry box of a woman. So for me, that is a real reach of the brand.", "Now the point is, to be balanced and have the different price points, and also to keep real innovation in the different segments of that diverse offer.", "As for the second point, yes, you are absolutely true, we are thrilled that we have, after now, one year in the job as Chief Artistic Officer, is really on the verge to present its first new jewelry collection, is a jewelry collection that is in platinum and diamonds. Is across different price points, and I think is going to be a very nice surprise for the market, but especially a very addictive kind of product we would offer [ph].", "So we are very confident about it. We are very excited about it, and we really look forward to launch it very soon.", "Mark Aaron", "And then relative to the tax rate, and with the full understanding that there are still a lot of moving parts, there is a lot of regulations that still haven't been fully clarified, whether it relates the branch operations or whether it relates to the foreign derived intangible income provisions and a whole bunch of other things that still need additional materials published on them. We believe that, on a going basis, because 70% of our income is earned in the U.S., will end up somewhere in the mid-20s.", "Erwan Rambourg", "Very clear. Thanks a lot for your help, gentlemen. Thanks.", "Operator", "We will go next to Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.", "Kimberly Greenberger", "Great. Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on your comments regarding investments in IT platforms, and Mark, you referred to expecting some better inventory management out of the new IT system investment. But I am wondering, if you can just sort of step back and talk more broadly about the new or improved capabilities you are looking for from these investments in IT systems? And then lastly, you talked about expectations longer term from meaningful improvement in your operating margin, do you have any initial thoughts on long term margin targets that you care to share with us today? Thank you so much.", "Mark Erceg", "Thank you for the question. So with respect to the information replatforming, we are very excited by what we are doing in this regard. It's going to give us one global order management system, which is going to allow us to effectively run one global distribution network, which currently is a bit of a challenge for us, given the complexity of the items, where we ship around the world, and requirements for the duties, given the fact that we ship precious metals and gemstones.", "We are also going to be able to consolidate our financial instances. We are currently running over two dozen financial instances all around the world, we are going to be able to consolidate that down to one. You could imagine what that will do for shared services and other types of platforms that can drive a lot of efficiencies. We have talked about indirect procurement. We began our indirect procurement journey back in 2015. The team has been doing fabulous, generating a lot of savings across all aspects of the business. But they have been doing it, and in fact, with one hand tied behind their back, because they haven't had a global procurement system to let them aggregate suppliers, let them do electronic invoicing and receipting, let them capture discount payments. And so that's another big element of it.", "And then really, the biggest one probably is what the omnichannel capabilities will be, that we will be able to have. We will have a seamless network from orders to shipment to fulfillment. You will be able to order online and pickup in store. I mean, this is really all kind of additional elements that will come along with it, and our digital capabilities will also be significantly enhanced, with a focus on mobile and mobile technology first, as far as that is concerned.", "Kimberly Greenberger", "And then just the long term margin targets, Mark?", "Mark Erceg", "Of course, yes. Look, we are confident that we are going to be able to continue to expand operating margin, after we get past the reset year or so. In 2018, we are going to be making some significant investments, as Alex indicated, in technology, in marketing communications, visual merchandising, digital store presentation. But we have had our operating margin the low 20s in the past, and we see no reason at all, structurally, why we won't be able to get back to that level, at some point in the future, and beyond.", "Kimberly Greenberger", "Great. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "We will go next to Ed Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Ed Yruma", "Hi, good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. Just a broader picture question Alessandro, the business sales gap or growth gap versus the European luxury peers has narrowed a bit recently. But any big takeaway as to why sales growth has been slower than some of your big peers? I know obviously mix and geography is certainly different. But any kind of big takeaway? And then I guess second, on e-com, you do have an existing relationship with Net-A-Porter, I guess, how do we think about growth both in an owned basis and through select third parties? Thank you.", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Thank you for your question. Yes, you are absolutely right, that if we look at the last few years, there has been a gap between our growth, very limited, and the one of some European luxury brands, and jewelers and not jewelers. Now the reason for that, I would say, is nothing structural. I mean, after six months in the job, I can tell you that, because this is obviously my first area of concern, and I can tell you that, my assessment says that, there is nothing structural why Tiffany has not been growing, at least in line with other players. Honestly, we have had newness also, in the past few years. The point was, that that newness was probably not as distinctive as the one that we would like to have in the future, to really make a difference. I think that, the brand has been a little bit understated during the last period of time. So nothing was really wrong, but I think we can get that up and increase the things that we are doing well, and we can just do it more intensively, faster, and with a bigger impact on the market.", "So honestly, I see -- okay, the past is the past, but I see that as a marvelous opportunity for the future, because there is nothing really broken to fix. On the contrary, there is a wide space that has been left there, and we are ready to occupy that.", "Now for your second question about e-commerce. Now, first of all, Tiffany has been one of the pioneers. I remember, when I was on the other side of the fence, and Tiffany was really a pioneer in e-commerce, and the proof of that is that we have a quarter of billion business in e-commerce in our own web site. So we are talking about something that is substantial, really substantial in the industry.", "I don't want to repeat what we already said. We are committed to make that business grow, and about your question about other platforms, yes, we are in Net-A-Porter. We are looking very carefully at that world, because it's a world that -- as we all know, it's changing at a very fast pace. And we don't have any prejudice towards platforms, as far as, which is for example, the case of Net-A-Porter, among others, are platforms that are luxury platforms, and we have to be consistent online, as we are brick and mortar, when it comes to a controlled environment where our customers purchase a proper price integrity, adequate marketing communications. So these are the criterias for us, totally open and looking at it closely.", "Ed Yruma", "Thank you very much.", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Thanks Ed.", "Operator", "We will go next to Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company.", "Oliver Chen", "Hi. Thank you. Alessandro, as you look ahead to the in-store experience, what are your thoughts on the future of the store, and how you can ensure that you get the customer engagement and innovation in store, that's consummate with the brands? And a related question, is that the future of luxury in digital, and what does that mean in terms of where you should be in offering elevated convenience and engagement and how the supply chain and inventory management will intersect with the evolution of omnichannel and digital, just to drive an effective experience as well as net working capital and the human side of engagement as well? Thank you.", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Thank you. Well as for our stores, at the end of the day, our aim is to surprise our customers, and of course, as a result of this, we will achieve meaningful comparable sales growth. But the point is really about the surprise of the customers. Customers nowadays have everything, they have such a huge offer in all kinds of facets of luxury and not luxury. I think Tiffany can bring a lot in terms of innovation attention through frequent, more frequent innovation, but especially meaningful and distinctive newness, in all categories.", "Now together with that goes the presentation of the products in the stores. This is why we want to invest more in different merchandising and this is why we are investing, even if this will take a little bit longer, more into the omnichannel experience; because nowadays, there is no silos anymore for a customer between the digital advertising or media that the customer sees, the tiffany.com where he or she lands, the physical store, I mean, all these things in the mind of consumers will even more so millennials. But results say, it's not only millennials, it's also baby boomers of my generation, we are changing our pattern of purchase, and that we are very-very fluid from one to another and there are no siloses [ph] anymore.", "So that is definitely the tact for the future, and what I would like to underline, is that in all this, Tiffany is set in a very good position, because of the positioning of the brand. I mean, Tiffany has always been compared to other brands and more, inclusive, more open to innovation. Less absolutely -- or less formal, and more about a joyful experience. For sure, very relevant for younger consumers. So we are really set in a special place, in order to succeed in this kind of challenge.", "Oliver Chen", "Okay. And any thoughts on the supply chain; because really revolutionizing digital has a lot to do with thinking about inventory accuracy in non-linear networks of placement, as well as enabling the salespeople to facilitate the convenience factor. So are there thoughts on where you are in that journey, and how that will match up with what you will be like, in terms of offering supreme digital convenience to new customers?", "Mark Erceg", "Yeah. What I would offer on that is, as we think about our information platforming, there is a bunch of base elements that go along with it, call that the source to pay procurement module, call that the financial model, call that the order management modules. We are also doing a digital replatforming, and then we are also endeavoring to build a data hub, which will allow us to put all kinds of additional analytical overlays on top of our merchandising tools and our pricing tools. So this is a complete suite of services we are effectively bringing forward, that's going to allow us to enhance our capabilities across all the areas. Alex talked about the fact we do a quarter of billion dollars of business on e-com.", "There is a huge treasure trove of customer data there, that we are going to be able to mine more efficiently, once we get all of our IT systems in place. We do that work today, but we are going to have a lot of additional enhanced capabilities, as it relates to it, and we are getting closer to our customers, and doing an even better job of clienteling.", "So we think we have a lot of upside in all of those regards.", "Oliver Chen", "Okay. Just lastly, Alessandro, self purchases versus gifting, the brand carries both, in terms of opportunities and range, would just love your thoughts on your diagnosis from that angle, in terms of what you want to do?", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Well that for me is a real blessing of this brand, because it's a brand that is relevant for a customer that wants to make a self purchase, as well as it's a magic brand for somebody who wants to gift a significant other or just a friend or whoever. This brand suits all these different cases, and this is not something obvious of many jewelers around the world.", "Now this is -- it's important, it's a competitive advantage, and these will be sustained in the different initiatives that Mark was referring to before, also digitally; because when you go on tiffany.com to buy a gift for somebody or when you want to do a purchase for yourselves, you must clearly find in our web site, the path, the area that is more -- makes it easier for you to do your purchase. So we are definitely on it, and I truly believe that is a big advantage for Tiffany.", "Oliver Chen", "Thank you and best regards.", "Mark Aaron", "And if I could just add, just in the interest of time, we still have a number of people I am sure who want to ask questions. Could you please limit yourself to one question and not these multipart questions? Thanks.", "Operator", "We will go next to Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.", "Brian Nagel", "Hi, good morning. Thank you for all the color, thank you for taking questions. So I will ask one question two parts. But first off, and it's all financially related really; on a very short term, you are recognizing that fourth quarter sales seem to hit the guidance you weighed out in mid-January. What explains the -- what seems to be a comp slowdown in the month -- I guess since the holiday, so probably in the month of January. Then the second part of the question, longer term, you talk a lot about the initiatives here, we obviously now have guide to 2018. To what extent or potential benefits of some of these key initiatives think into guidance for 2018? Thank you.", "Mark Erceg", "I think it's a great set of questions. So with respect to the comp stores, I just want to make sure that we are clear. We finished 2016 and our comps were down mid-single digits. Throughout the course of 2017, we have seen that strength and we were down two in the first quarter, we were down one in the second. We went flat, then we went to plus one. So at the end of the day, we are feeling that we are making progress. We still have a long way to go, but we are clearly moving in the right direction, and we are not overly concerned about what might be one month, particularly when there was the Chinese New Year, which kind of flopped from one period to the next to some extent.", "So we feel that we are strengthening, and we want to look at things over the quarters, which again sequentially, have improved.", "Mark Aaron", "And we did have a strong January last year, so it was a bit of a tougher comparison.", "Mark Erceg", "Correct. As far as whether or not there are some of these initiatives already baked through the 2018 guidance, I think I would say, that the simple answer is yes. We have been working on a number of these initiatives for a while now, and they are starting to provide meaningful benefits. We think those benefits will increase over time, which we are excited about. But yes, there are some factored into 2018.", "Brian Nagel", "Got it. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We will go next to Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.", "Omar Saad", "Thank you for taking my question. Just a little bit of a follow-up; it seems like Asia was the area where you saw the biggest drop-off, holiday to January? And then as you think about the comp guidance, low to mid singles for 2018, help us think about e-com, now that you are going to be including in the comp, as most retailers do at this point, what's the growth rate there, how much of a contributor is that to the kind of overall comp trends we should expect going forward? Thank guys.", "Mark Aaron", "Yeah Omar, I will just say that, in terms of Asia, looking like it dropped off. We said there was no big effect from the shift in the Chinese New Year. There was certainly some effect. We also have noted a lot of wholesale sales in the Asia-Pacific region, especially in Korea, and that can be a little bit choppy from month-to-month and certainly quarter-to-quarter. But there is nothing really unusual to point out in terms of AsiaPac slowing down technically from the holiday season to the full fourth quarter.", "Mark Erceg", "And then with respect to e-com, we do expect e-com to grow faster than our base business during 2018, which I think Mark shared in his prepared remarks.", "Omar Saad", "Great. Thank you guys. Welcome Alessandro.", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse.", "Michael Binetti", "Hey guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question here. And a lot of my questions have been answered, but maybe I could just ask on -- I might be curious on the economics of the pop-up stores, and how you guys look at that strategy? Is that something that you guys could see rolling out more going forward, and maybe just touch on the economics about how it impacts some of the touchpoints along the P&L? Thanks.", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Thank you, Michael, for your question. Yes, we were very excited in the last quarter of last year to open a few pop-up stores, a couple of them in New York City, and some also in Canada. During the year, we had also one for few weeks in Tokyo. So all this is a very effective way for me to connect with customers out of the usual skin, and it is also a way to measure the reaction of consumers and to see if the link with the brand is there.", "And in this respect, all these top up stores have been really a positive factor in this respect. When it comes to the financials, I have to say, they have been financially profitable, in the sense that we didn't lose money doing that, but it is not -- first of all, it is nothing material, and especially, is not really the main purpose of that exercise. Let me say, they are self-financed kind of activities, but the major work of it is testing new things with customers.", "Michael Binetti", "Thank you very much.", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.", "Dana Telsey", "Good morning and welcome Alessandro. Given your background and coming from Bulgari, what are the similarities and differences between your assessment of Tiffany's and how you accelerated and enhanced Bulgari? Are there similarities between the two businesses? Thank you.", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Well the similarities are many. Of course, we talk about two global brands. Two brands that are really founded on jewelry, where most of the business relies on jewelry. And what -- and I think two wonderful and very respectful brands.", "Now having said so, what I see directly, after six months in the job, as a difference of Tiffany versus Bulgari, is that Tiffany is more understated, younger, and also more joyful than Bulgari as a brand. And this for me is very important, because this is the DNA of the brand, is the way the brand is, is like the personality of a person. There is not good or bad personality, everybody has its own personality. But the factor being so, younger, joyful and understated, I think is a great opportunity for Tiffany, because this is very much in line with the changes that are going on in the luxury experience in this space.", "In these days, luxury is very solid, but the luxury experience is changing. Luxury is no longer equal to formality, luxury is no longer predominantly for richer and typical traditionally, more older people. Now luxury is meaningful to a large audience, and I think in that respect, Tiffany, because of its DNA, because of its personality, is really best set to define the new cost of luxury. And I think this is so exciting, both personally as a professional challenge, as well as I think financially for the future of this company.", "Dana Telsey", "Thank you.", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Rick Patel with Needham and Company.", "Rick Patel", "Thank you. Good morning everyone and thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could provide more color on your plans to increase marketing this year? You have done a really nice job, over the last year on the creative side, and partnering with some ambassadors. When we think about the increase this year, are you just going to be doing more of that, are you taking a different approach, and how do we think about the emphasis between digital versus more traditional channels? Thank you.", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Thank you, Rick. Well I said before, that we want to surprise our customers. So we will not repeat anything that we did last year, that was successful. For example, the launch of HardWear and it was a very good launch, it was successful. We are pleased with it. But we are in the business of surprise. So we have a long list of projects for this year, to surprise customers in a different way. And --", "Mark Aaron", "It will surprise you too.", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "And we really look forward. But really, I am talking about the next -- starting from the next few months, you will start seeing a lot of activities in marketing, related to the new launch that we were referring to before, as well as -- and this is very important, icons, our icons. So it's about the new product, but it's about our icons, that we sustained together with high jewelry, throughout the year, with a lot of exciting marketing initiatives. All of them will be also digital, and most of our marketing investment is since -- already two years now, is more on the digital side, rather than the traditional print media. This is a trend of all the brands, and Tiffany is surely leading that.", "Rick Patel", "Look forward to seeing you. Good luck.", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will got next to Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.", "Tom Nikic", "Hey, good morning everyone. This is actually Tom Nikic on for Ike. Thanks for taking our question. I wanted to ask you, you spoke about accelerating the pace of new product introductions, and you have obviously had some success over the last couple of years with new products that you have launched, such as HardWear and Tiffany T, but you also have this vault of very classic styles and classic collections. And I guess, sort of how do you balance this initiative to sort of accelerate the rate of new product platforms, while also maintaining that sort of classic Tiffany style? Thanks.", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Thank you for your question. I don't remember exactly the day and the year, but when Tiffany opened a new store, a big store, I am talking about the 19th century, in Union Square, the newspaper, I think it was the New York Times or the equivalent at the time had that. Now in New York, there is a new palace of jewels. Well Tiffany has been true to that statement through centuries. So really, as the palace of jewels, there is room, and it' needed under that roof to have a wide offer, that covers the different consumers preferences, occasions of usage.", "To this mix of very design lines, Tiffany T for example, or more edgy lines, HardWear or more classic lines, like Victoria for example. Not to mention, all the solitaire diamond, these are all different facets of today's jewelry, of today's way of wearing jewelry by women. So I don't see absolutely a contrast or a contradiction there, on the contrary, it's all complementary, in order to provide a really full experience, in line with the palace of jewels that our predecessors managed to build more than 100 years ago.", "Tom Nikic", "All right. Sounds good. Best of luck this year.", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Janet Kloppenburg with JJK Research.", "Janet Kloppenburg", "Good morning everyone and congratulations on a good holiday. Just two quick questions; Alessandro, if you could talk a little bit about the Engagement category opportunity, you talked about watches and homes. I was wondering, what you envision for the Engagement category and if there was an opportunity to perhaps capture market share there? And Mark, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the puts and takes on gross margin and how we should be thinking about it for fiscal 2018 and 2019? I know mix issues are at hand, as well as commodity pricing and some potential price increases. Thanks so much.", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Thank you. Well touching on your first point, Diamond and Engagement Jewelry. Now Tiffany stands for several things in the mind of consumers since generations. For sure, love, engagement, is definitely equal and synonymous to Tiffany. And this is something that is very important, and is the strength of the brand.", "Now the world changes, the world has changed. The way people love, the way people express their love has changed and is changing recently, and we see a tremendous opportunity for Tiffany in that area, because we believe that the business of love is a business that will be there forever until humanity exists. But our opportunity is to evolve with the new morals of society, and if there is one brand that can do that, that is definitely Tiffany.", "I think we have seen already a little bit of that, I mean to give you something more tangible, in the recent Believe in Love campaign. I don't know if you have seen it, otherwise you can find it easily on YouTube. That is a first indication of a direction. But Engagement, although it has been a challenging category in the past few years, I think at the same time, reserves us a very good opportunity.", "Mark Erceg", "And real quickly on the gross margin question; we do expect gross margin to expand somewhat in 2018. Over the past many years, there has been a large benefit we have been deriving from significantly lower metal and rough diamond prices. We think metals will be roughly flat year-over-year, but we do expect a little bit of health from lower diamond input costs. We do believe that we are still a brand, and increasingly still, a brand that has pricing power, as we reassert ourselves more aggressively in the marketplace. The pricing power we have always enjoyed, we believe will expand frankly over time. And so we are confident that we will be able to continue to push gross margin.", "We also are confident that we are doing other things to find ways to structurally address our costs. We have talked in the past about the need to be able to achieve SG&A leverage at a lower rate of sales growth, and we have a lot of initiatives that are related to that, and while the primary intent of the jewelry design and innovation workshop is just that to drive innovation, it will also allow for fast prototyping. It will allow for [indiscernible] analysis. It will allow us to have some additional high end costing tools. We will be able to bring detailed spec packages forward, and that will let us manage our production network more nimbly as well.", "Janet Kloppenburg", "Thanks so much. Good luck.", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Kevin Heenan with Guggenheim.", "Kevin Heenan", "Hi good morning. This is Kevin on for Bob Drbul. I just wanted to follow-up on the advertising, as we move into 2018 I think, as a percent of sales, if that stepped up over the past few years. I was wondering, how we might be able to think about the change, as a percent of sales into 2018, and just any thoughts on what the right level for the company might be, over the longer term? Thanks.", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Thank you, Kevin. Now as you know, marketing is typically 7%, 7.5% of our total sales turnover. Now honestly, I believe that there is not a magic number. I wouldn't know to tell you, which is the magic percentage of marketing over total sales. 7.6% is in the range. There are brands that spend more than that, whether it's a substantial amount. Now honestly, more than talking about the percentage of marketing investment over the total sales, for me the most important thing is, the effectiveness of that expense and to use that money in a way that really, I come back to my obsession, surprises the customers; because sometimes, you can put a lot of money in more traditional kind of campaign or media, and you don't sort the same effect on doing something else.", "Let me make an example. For me, one of the great campaigns of last year, has been the opening of the Blue Box Caf\u00e9. Now honestly speaking, that was not media. We actually opened the caf\u00e9. But that had a huge number, that we talked about mediums of impressions, and that was a fantastic marketing tool. So the world has become more complicated maybe, but also more open to smart ideas, and this is where I am really challenging and trying to push and inspire the teams to be more bearing, when it comes to our way to communicate to customers, above and beyond the marketing budget.", "Mark Aaron", "And Kevin, I would just add to that that, it sort of ties to a previous question, that we don't disclose our marketing mix in terms of how much is print versus digital versus social and all that. But certainly, it's a combination of all three. Print is still very important, but increasingly digital and social as well, and as Alessandro said, even PR activities, which can really resonate with customers as well. So it's a whole big combination of things.", "Okay, next question?", "Operator", "We will go next go to Laura Champine with Loop Capital.", "Laura Champine", "Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Just wanted a little more color on the changes that you plan to make in the store environment, just because to us, stores already look pretty good. So if you could be specific on changes you are looking to make there, we are very interested? Thanks.", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Thank you, Laura, for this question; and thank you for your appreciation of our stores. Yes definitely, Tiffany has a wonderful fleet of stores, and I have to say, some are brand new, some are less new, but all of them kept a very high level. Honestly, I have seen also stores 13, even 15 years old, some of them, and they look good. So that is not the point. The point for me is to inject some freshness, some newness, some excitement in the store, because nowadays, consumers are more demanding. It's not enough to have a beautiful store. The point is that, you have a beautiful store, I have been to the store a couple of times, why shall I come a third time or a fourth time, when I can comfortably buy the same product from tiffany.com. So it is that excitement that is needed, and this is what we are planning to do. This is why, in the guidance or the financial indication that we gave, we said that we are going to increase investment in visual merchandising, store presentations, because it's exactly to deliver excitement in the stores.", "Above and beyond store construction, store comps at the end of this, because this is a totally different area that is a multiyear kind of work, is more linked to CapEx than expenses. I am more referring to visual merchandising and the in-store presentations as a way to animate the point of sale.", "Laura Champine", "Got it. Thank you.", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada.", "Brian Tunick", "Thanks very much. Curious Alessandro, if any of the six strategies you laid out, particularly focus on the millennial customer? There was a lot of focus these last couple of years there, so just curious anything very focused on the millennial, bring the new customer in? And my second question, can you maybe help us understand or benchmark from a product newness or introduction perspective, how Tiffany would rank versus the global luxury peers that you refer to? Thanks very much.", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Thank you, Brian. Well, let me share with you my thoughts, because there is a lot of talking about millennials in all industries. Now if we look at luxury, and especially jewelry. If there is a brand that traditionally has been dealing with the millennials of all the years, since 180 years, that is Tiffany. Now we call them millennials, but Tiffany having been so strong historically with the Engagement business and also with the gift business, has been the brand of choice for young customers that were there for graduation, for engagement, for marrying. So Tiffany, because of its past as being the brand of millennials, is almost 100 years.", "Now all these six priorities that we have set down, all of them are focused over millennials, because millennials are the clients of Tiffany, an important portion of the clients of Tiffany, and especially, because of these changes that are going on in society, that actually are starting from millennials, from the younger generation, and then they contaminate, let me say the other generations, it's even more important for Tiffany, that whatever we do, in all six priorities, they are really focused over the way young generations act. And I would -- and this is just to take an example, the first priority, amplify and evolve brand message.", "What do I mean by evolve? By evolve, I mean, really to shift our historic perceived brand message, to being more -- to be closer to today's younger generation's way of approaching life, more self attraction, celebrating love in a different way, and more everyday usage of jewelry or simply a more and strong empowered kind of woman. So for me, the real objective is, when I say amplify and evolve brand message, is to bring Tiffany in the middle of the new cultural conversations. This is really what inspires all the priorities we have set.", "Operator", "We will go next to Marni Shapiro with Retail Tracker.", "Marni Shapiro", "Thank you. Congratulations on a great holiday. So Alessandro, as you think about -- a lot of terms, a lot of conversation on this call, it feels like there is a lot of energy at the brand here, and a lot of, what I would think of as, more modern energy. You are relocating and renovating a bunch of stores this year. How will you use what you have learned from your pop-up stores in your caf\u00e9, to inform what the stores will look like going forward? And you mentioned that luxury doesn't -- and no longer has to -- is no longer equal to formality. How should we think about your sales associates going forward; because Tiffany sales associates have historically been a very formal proposition in your store?", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Thank you for your question. Well definitely, I can assure that the energy is there, and this is what keeps us moving and going every day. Now, one of the reasons -- of the many reasons, why we invest in some pop-ups, is also to experiment things, that -- to see if they are relevant for consumers, and in order to then roll them out or not, in the rest of the stores.", "I will give you a small example; one of the recent pop-ups was one on the West Coast --", "Marni Shapiro", "In the Grove?", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "In the Grove, exactly, and it was a very small store, and quite unusual, and it lasted just for a few weeks, it was in February. But one of the highlights of that pop-up was the personalization of jewelry. So basically, you could go there, buy a pendant in gold and silver whatever, and have a personalization, where you were basically the designer. You could draw simply on an iPad itself and design and that design would be engraved on the spot, on the product that you are purchasing. Now that resonated very strongly with the consumers, to the previous question, to millennials, but also non-millennial. And we found that, that was a proof of concept, that for us was very important, and this is an area where we are going to invest a lot. And to roll it out in many other stores.", "So yes, the answer is definitely these pop-ups are also useful for this kind of experiments.", "Marni Shapiro", "The sales associates?", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Yes, about the sales associates. Well you know, I think we have thousands and thousands of sales associates in our stores, where we really focus about is, the level of service that -- I have to say, that service is a real obsession in this company. I was impressed, how all the retail teams are really serious about that, and not only in talking, as a lip service, that every brand would do, but also in terms of resources, money, that is invested in training, in metrics that are strictly monitored at store level, at country level, at global level, sales associate level. So service is definitely there.", "Well about modernization, I don't think it is a company role to modernize people. I think that -- the good thing of luxury brand, is that they are very inspirational for all of us as employees of the brand. So the moment the brand gets more -- I mean, more modern and more joyful, more easy going in its communication, in its product, in its marketing; naturally, we will all be contaminated and sales associates, as well as the CEO will become more modern, I hope.", "Marni Shapiro", "Thank you very much. Best of luck for spring season.", "Alessandro Bogliolo", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And at this time, there are no further questions. I will turn the call back to Mark Aaron.", "Mark Aaron", "Okay. Thank you. I think we can wrap up the Q&A now. I hope our formal remarks and the Q&A sufficiently addressed your areas of interest. Please note on your calendars, that we expect to report first quarter results on Wednesday, May 23, with a conference call and Q&A.
